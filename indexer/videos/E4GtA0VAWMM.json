  "transcript": "what's going on everybody today we're\ngoing to talk about how i landed my job\nat microsoft welcome to a new video i'm\ngps\nthat was the wrong way but anyway you\nget it uh all right so it starts in 2019\ntowards the end of the year in december\nthe azure advocates were hosting this\nthing called 25 days of surveillance and\nit was basically you would submit like\nsolutions using github uh that of these\nproblems that they they've sort of\nproposed uh using serverless technology\nand i met uh simona coten who used to be\na microsoft advocate and now has moved\non to a different team um through that\njust on twitter kind of like back before\nlike submitting and then she would reply\nto my tweets like oh great work and\nthings like that i hold simona so near\nand dear to my heart thank you so much\nsimona for the impact that you've had in\nmy career um\ni don't think i would be here without\nyou so thank you um but anyway uh yeah\nand and and so that happens is you know\nit's about a month and then i realized\nlike oh i really want to keep doing this\ni i really like like showcasing my work\nto to to the community and things like\nthat and i got a lot of help and support\nlike it feels great like it feels like i\ni can learn better this way um fast\nforward to 2020 in march the quarantine\nhappens and i find myself with more free\ntime because no commute so i was like i\nwant to start a youtube channel and i do\ni start making weekly videos sometimes\ntwice a week on azure functions because\ni was utilizing that at work as a cloud\nengineer to build uh solutions i started\nmaking videos um and like bunch of bunch\nof videos fast forward to a couple\nmonths maybe around the i think june i\nthink it was around my birthday remember\nthat i made two videos that have gone\nsince then viral i have like almost 100\n000 views each\nthe how i became a cloud engineer with\nno club with no degree and the how to\nbecome a cloud engineer and then scott\nhanselman\nscott hansen is probably one of the most\nfamous technical people out there\nhe's like such a great teacher such\na solid person as well like um he\ninvites me on to azure friday which is\nthe show that he's been doing for years\nuh and inside the microsoft azure\nchannel and we just talk about the video\nwe talk about like what i'm doing with\nyoutube and like creating cloud\ncomputing content and things like that\nand yeah and it really was just like he\njust danced hey you want to come on\nazure friday i saw your videos fantastic\nthat's literally it um\nso i mean i guess the biggest thing for\nme has been\none putting myself out there putting in\nthe work but also just people willing to\nlend a hand because they felt like i\ndeserved it for whatever reason it might\nbe um\nso yeah after after that i also got\nnominated for microsoft mvp which i got\nin august and then the azure friday\nthing happened also in august for me it\nwas like so many things like just\naligned and\num a lot of it i was in control of and a\nlot of it was just i wasn't right it was\nup to like everyone else who helped me\nout so that was fantastic\nfast forward to september uh the\nadvocates were doing this serverless\nseptember thing uh and you might be\nfamiliar with christian wamba his he\ngoes by code beast um he's moved on from\nmicrosoft since then and we're still\nclose friends which is fantastic um and\ni guess my biggest tip here is like when\nyou\nsort of build relationships or you\nnetwork make sure you're doing them with\nproper intention and not just to get\nsomething out of people because you\nnever know what they're gonna turn into\num\nso yeah simona introduces me to to to\nchris and then chris is like hey you\nwanna you know we're live streaming\nthese things on friday we're sort of\njust walking through some azure\nfunctions exercises and then we're gonna\nend with doing this conference on the\nlast day and the last week of september\nand it's gonna be all serverless kind of\nstuff i'm like fantastic i knew i knew\nserverless i was a big fan of it\nand this was going to be my first time\nactually doing something like a proper\nmicrosoft event on their channels and\nstuff like that so i was like yeah let's\ndo it it was a lot of fun like we would\nplay music we would just like do\nfunctions things we would chat we would\nlaugh just like a bunch of stuff um i'm\nstill very close with chris we talk\nabout music production we talk about\nvideo games we talk about um you know\ncode and things like that um\nso yeah i made a great friend out of\nthat i had the experience of\nparticipating in that event and fast\nforward to november of 2020 i joined a\ncloud guru and i was doing a lot of like\ndifferent kind of content in terms of\ncloud there was also some devops linux\nkind of stuff thing things like that but\nthe biggest part of a cloud guru that i\ngained was hosting the azure resume\nchallenge\nwhich was this community project kind of\nthing in which it was building your\nyour resume with azure services um and\njust seeing like lots and lots of people\nsort of build their own solutions uh and\nand and sort of leading the way for that\ni think that was great and it was a\nreally big talking point that i used uh\nwhen interviewing for my current\nmicrosoft role\nuh so yeah that was great and and and it\nwas april and rishab you all might i've\nseen richard on my channel he's one of\nmy closest friends um he sends me the\nlink to the job that i have now and then\ni talked to chris and\nand simone about the role they both were\nable to recommend me for the role\nuh again because they've had examples of\nmy work my youtube channel my blog but\nalso we've worked personally together\nand and then i you know land a\nconversation with the hiring manager oh\nhere's a fun fact again this is why i\ntell y'all you never know who you're\ngoing to meet or what you're going to\nend up working in\nmy hiring manager now justin garrett we\nactually had a like a session together\nfor the microsoft reactor back in march\nand i think was during international\nwomen's\nuh day like around that week and we were\ntalking about uh the topic was\nchampioning for change that's a hard\nword to say championing for change\nand also uh sarah guthols who's my\ncolleague was on that conversation too\nand it was just such a great\nintroduction to my colleague and and my\nmanager uh because we were just talking\nabout something that had nothing to do\nwith any technical skills it was just\nlike how to be like you know how to how\nto speak up for for change and and sort\nof how like what initiatives you take\nand just things like that was fantastic\nso anyway i had already had a\nconversation with justin without knowing\nthat he would eventually turn into my\nmanager i don't know this world is such\na small world anyway we have our first\nconversation then he remembers like oh\nyeah we had that convo during\ninternational women's day and that kind\nof thing um\nand yeah it takes like about a month of\ninterviewing and and stuff like that but\nthen i received an offer and then\nthree months later actually yesterday\nthe 21st is three months at microsoft\num yeah i it's been a heck of a journey\nand and though i'm only talking from\nlike 2018 to 2019 until now everything\nthat i did prior to that has helped like\nthey helped us experience this admin\nexperience the retail experience all of\nit has helped um\nand and yeah i'm very grateful for\npeople who have like given me a hand\nwhich is also why i try to be that for\nfor the people hopefully i'm doing a\ndecent job at that\nuh but yeah it's really the how i ended\nup here um i'm cloud advocate now um\ni guess like a super super simple\nsimplified explanation what a\nclassification we sort of sit between\nthe engineering and then the people who\nuse the stuff that we make and we\nprovide like hey uh this is how this\nthing works here's a demo or what kind\nof things would you like to see like we\nadvocate for\nnot only for obviously our products but\nalso for like what what people want to\nknow what people want to see about those\nthings too um you all have been seeing\ni've like do these youtube sessions\nthese live sessions um everything's sort\nof online now but i can't wait for us to\ngo back in person and then i keep\ntouching the microphone i'm so sorry\nand doing sessions and live and then if\nyou're ever in new york city you can\ncatch one at the the microsoft reactor\nhere um but anyway that's that's my\nstory um\nyeah if you have any questions comments\nand things i i feel like i was battling\nbut anything you want me clarify let me\nknow i'll see you in the next video",
