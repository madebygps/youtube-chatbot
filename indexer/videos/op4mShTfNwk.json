  "title": "How to become a Cloud Security Engineer with @DayCyberwox",
  "transcript": "i don't know anything about cloud\nsecurity so i had to get a professional\nuh but dave let's kick let's kick it off\nby asking you what do you do now and\nhow long have you been doing it i\ncurrently work as\na cloud threat detection engineer i did\na dog\num i've been there since march 2022 so\njust about\nfour months now i think yeah so yeah\nthat's it what were you doing before\nthat so i was working in security\noperations i was a threat analyst um\nworking\nsomething you something you would uh\nconsider similar to a cell catalyst so\npretty much through like threat analysis\nsecurity operations and all of those\nthings\nhow long were you doing that for\ni did that for about a year\nand\nabout a year and uh\nthree four months\nsorry from like an internship got my\nfirst full-time job as a stock analyst\nand then pivoted to another role where i\nwas working as a three analyst one got\npromoted like after four months two\nthird analyst two so the whole the whole\nexperience was just about a little over\na year a year\nthree four five six months\nso wait was that your first job in tech\nmy first job was an internship a\nsecurity internship so i got that like\nright after like freshman year of\ncollege um so i was doing the security\noperations\nbasically efficient analysis uh did a\nlittle bit of that was my first\nintroduction to azure so i did a little\nbit of like azure security endpoint\nsecurity all of those things that was\nkind of what gave me like my\nintroduction to security\nfreshman in college isn't that like\ncause you're super young\nisn't that like last year i was like\nthat was that was 20 so i started\nfreshman year 2019 and then\nend of freshman year was 2020.\nhow did you land an internship in\nsecurity\nas a freshman see that's a really good\nquestion because it typically is hard to\nland internships in general and to land\nsecurity internships specifically\nafter freshman year um so\ni just saw so i was in like this\ncommunity um and i was seeing a bunch of\npeople just like getting internships it\nwas like big internships like google\nmicrosoft i'll speak big companies it's\nlike i want to get an internship and\nlike i i i really like studied the\nsecurity industry and i realized that\num it's really hard to get into the\nindustry and one of the best ways is to\nleverage internships and i was like if i\ncould get an internship my freshman year\nthen like i would have like if i could\nget an internship my freshman year and\njust do internships for the rest of the\nfour years i would have at least three\nfour years of experience by time i'm\ngraduating and like i wouldn't have the\nissue of like i don't have experience so\ni can't get a job so i was like i'm\ngoing to do everything to get even\nstarted even if it was not a security\ninternship if it's like a help desk job\nthat i could use to get experience i was\ngoing to use that to leverage and get\nlike a more a better job so i was like\napplying for any job and i was like\ndoing training like certification just\nstudying doing projects and\nlike it took me like over like 150\napplications and like multiple like\nfield filled interviews because i sucked\nat interviewing like i didn't know\nanything about interviewing but like\nwhen you feel a couple of times you\nstart realizing like what is necessary\nto like pass those interviews and like\nwhat employers are really looking for so\ni kind of really studied the game\nunderstood like what exactly employers\nare looking for\ntheir couple interviews filled with them\nand then\nwhen i got the interview opportunity for\nthat internship i was like\ni gotta kill this one like i gotta get\nthis one this has to be the one uh study\nreally hard for it um did it the\ninterview\ngot the job and use that as leverage to\nget my first full-time job after six\nmonths\nyou turned a six-month internship into a\nfull-time job yeah and then you did that\nfor\na little bit over a year and now you're\nat datadog yes\ncrazy i hope you know that like the\nother day i found out actually how young\nyou are and i'm just like\nhow but okay so i get so i get it\nyou you were super dedicated your first\nyear like i gotta land an internship no\nmatter what and no matter where i start\nwhich i feel like is a mindset that not\na lot of people have because they want\nto go straight into\nstraight into class straight into\nengineering software dev and they want\nto skip everything else because i don't\nknow i feel like you know support roles\nget uh maybe like a bad rep or something\nlike that but i feel like they close\nthemselves off to a lot because if you\nput in a good year at like you know any\nkind of entry-level job that can take\nyou\nanywhere\ni would agree i think like especially\nnow with\nthe um availability of like cloud\nsupport roles for aws azure or gcp i\nthink\nthat is a really good entryway into like\ncyber security because like you get to\nlike see a lot of things like and like\nwork with a lot of like services\ntechnologies and when you really\nunderstand those services\nand like those technologies or the cloud\nenvironment in depth it really makes the\nsecurity aspect a lot easier because\nlike you understand the fundamental like\narchitecture administration all of that\nstuff and like figuring out like how an\nattacker would exploit something in that\nthing would be easier for you because\nyou know how everything works about it\nand then you can okay this is how i can\nsecure this or this is how i can detect\nagainst this particular thing i think\nlike right now with the way like you can\neasily just like do a bunch of projects\nfuture skills and land a cloud support\nrole that could be a really good way for\npeople to like transition into cloud\nsecurity yeah i feel the same way i feel\nlike it's your entry level to to then\nstep into what other other discipline\nand i guess that makes sense because i'm\nthinking about me like i'm trying to\nlearn more about security and i guess if\ni sort of shaped it around like a niche\nthat i'm good at so i use a lot of like\nserverless technologies if i might if my\nnext step was like all right how do i\nsecure these things that i work with\nevery single day i feel like that's\neasier than just going like completely\noh first step like broad level security\nyeah right like approaching it from\nsomething that i'm already familiar with\ni like that i'm gonna give that a try\nyeah so you you mentioned certifications\nwhat was like when you were applying for\ninternships what certifications did you\nalready have and then which ones do you\nhave now and which ones do you think\nactually matter yeah so when i was\napplying for internships so the first\none i got was the comptia applause right\npretty generic right um but like for me\nit was like\ni needed to do that certification like i\njust i needed to go through that process\nbecause i failed my first attempt so i\nneeded to go through that process of\nfailing it and like getting those\ncertifications going going through like\nthat great of like really studying and\ntrying to pass a certification for\neverything else to like just\nfall in line because that was like what\nlike it wasn't even really the\ncertification it was just like the\nprocess of like\nstudying and just like really like\ngetting down the methodology of like\nlearning concepts and like building\nthose skills that like you know built\nthe foundation for everything else so\nlike just that process of like studying\nso i got the a plus around like um june\nor july um\nin 20 2020 and then i got the network\nplus like 30 days after so like it just\ntook me 30 days to get another applause\nlike non-stop like i was right into it\nand this was like during the pandemic\nright so like i lost my job like\ndecember of the previous year and i was\nlike i was like i was like i was mad\ni was like pretty depressed i was like i\nhave to find something and it wasn't\nreally about the money right it was more\nabout like\ni i have to start working because i i\njust didn't feel comfortable with like\nnot working and i was like i'm\npassionate about cyber security i want\nto get the experience i want to get even\nit's like a help desk job i was like the\na plus is a good way to start like as a\nfoundation for everything like it didn't\nmatter if i didn't get a cyber security\njob so i was like a plus then i realized\nlike\na lot of everything is like really\nsurrounded around networking like\nwhether you're like you're doing cloud\nor security like networking is like\ncentral to all of these things so\ni was like network plus next thing right\nand that covered like the networking\naspect for me like that's that was like\nthe foundation for the rest of my career\nso\nat the time i actually got my internship\ni so i was i had plus the a plus\ni was studying for the network plus when\ni was interviewing\nfor the internship\nand i just passed the number plus right\nafter i got the offer for the internship\nand then literally my first day of my\ninternship like one of my senior\nengineers like gave me a security plus\ntextbook it was like hey this is all you\nneed to pass the security plus go study\nthis and go take a security plus and\nlike i took that book write it cover to\ncover and like took the security plus\nlike three months after so that was like\nthose were my first couple of\ncertifications like how they played out\nafterwards um\ni did\nwhatever certification i do did i do i\njust started doing a bunch of training\nhonestly after that because i was like i\ndidn't just want to like just get\ncertifications i was getting the skills\nbut like um i really wanted to start\ndoing like hands-on training so i spent\na lot of time doing that then i got like\nthe azure fundamentals i got the splunk\ncore user because i wanted to join a\ncompany that was business splunk and i\nfelt like if i had a splunk\ncertification that would help me\nunderstand splunk better and just be\nmore marketable with the skill\nthat did the tscy\nzip loss which is a cyber security\nanalyst one\ndid aws cloud practitioner um\nlinux fundamentals i know you did that\none\nand most recently actually in january i\ndid\nthe blue team level one which was like a\n24-hour uh security incident response\ncertification and\nfor me\nthati don't want to say like that was one\nthat really mattered because i don't\nwant to discount like the\nlevel of effort and like the impact\nthose other certifications had in my\ncareer\nbut that particular certification was\nif i were to do all over again i'll\nprobably just do just that one or maybe\nthe network plus because that's that's\nimportant\nbut that certification especially for if\nyou want to get into like security\noperations\nit's like the best thing i can recommend\nfor you because it covers everything and\nit's hands-on um i know i i did i had a\ntweet recently about like hands-on like\ncloud certifications and how they're\nvaluable it's kind of it was it covered\neverything that i would want for a\nsecurity operation certification that\nwould like be necessary for me to get a\nsecurity analyst job and um that one is\nthat's the one all right everyone so\nin terms of certifications that's what\nyou would recommend so if someone was\nlike trying to get into security you\nwould say\nput a lot more effort into like would\nyou say blue team level one all right\nand said not that the other ones don't\nmatter and i guess it depends on where\neveryone's at cause like if someone is\ncompletely new to tech i could see how\nthe a plus is useful\nbut i'm gonna assume that people here\nare interested in security so that's a\ngood a good one to start you also\nmentioned like doing labs and projects\nand trainings and things that aren't\nnecessarily tied to certifications can\nyou is there any like specific projects\nthat stand out to you that you think\npeople can try and like maybe put on\ntheir resume is github important when it\ncomes to\nbuilding a portfolio or like standing\nout for for jobs and security yeah so\nthat's a packed question um but like\nyou know there were several things so\npersonally for me it was my\ncybersecurity homeland project which to\nthis day is number one if you do a\ngoogle search for cybersecurity home lab\nit's number one on google search it's\nbeen that way for about a year\nso um that was like the biggest project\nthat had like the most impact on like my\nentire career and like in a way was part\nof like how i got a data dog now i could\ntell that story later um but that was\nlike the biggest project because i spent\nso much time on that project like it\ntook me months because i had to do it\nlike three times so i had to do it i had\nto figure out\nhow i wanted the project to be then i\nhad to document it on my blog and i had\nto do a video for it like a video series\nfor it so i did it three three times\nbut um it had the most impact on like\nlike building my knowledge and like\nreally like uh in like uh the core\nsecurity concepts and like really\nbuilding my skills um in general um but\nlike it wouldn't be the same for\neveryone right if you're doing like\nif you're for example like that my\nexperience has been like security\noperations if you're going into like\npentesting like which is like the\noffensive side where you're like hacking\nstuff like you you might have a\ndifferent project like your project\nmight be like building a\noffensive security tool like python and\nthat would be like where like your\ngithub would matter because like that\nwould be where you install the code but\nlike if you're doing something like that\nproject i did it might not be github it\nmight be like your blog or like your\nyoutube channel or something else so\nlike it really depends on like what\nyou're interested in in security and if\nit was a cloud security project it would\nbe different right like you'd have video\nyou might even have like a github repo\nfor like some code that you use or like\nyou know maybe you use like terraform\nfor the environment so like it really\ndepends on like you know what project\nyou work in but i think\num especially when you're starting out\nlike it's usually that one like project\nor that one thing or just a couple of\nthings that you put so much time and\neffort into so i'd say find something\nfind a problem that you think is like\nsomething that\nis going to help you learn multiple\nskills or even like a specific skill and\ngo solve that problem\nand for me it was like\ni didn't find i didn't see\nthere were so many uh cyber security\nhome lab project out there but nothing\nwas really consolidated and really like\nsomething probably my i had i was like\ni'm gonna go build this and i built it\nand like it's helped like tons of people\nlike i got people telling like you know\nthis project really helped me like when\ni was trying to get a security job stuff\nlike that so and it doesn't matter it\ndoesn't have to be cybersecurity home\nlab it could be anything right whether\nyou're interested in like you know\nsecurity operations system response\npentestin find a problem solve it and\ndocument it and share it like let people\nsee it like flaunt it everywhere\ni love that i'll add that project to the\nto the description the link there so\npeople can check that out i think\nespecially well i think in all areas of\ntech but being able to\ncommunicate i think especially in\nsecurity\nuh is like a massive\nmassive ability and skill and i think um\none thing someone told me who i can't\nremember what area of security they're\nin but they were they were saying\nevery time when a massive company has\nsome sort of hack there are always like\nanalysis what are they called like the\nnext day i forget there's a specific\nname about like yeah incident and\nthey'll do reports and stuff like right\nso they were telling me like if you\nreally wanted to sort of become you kind\nof kind of like reverse engineer it like\nyou go grab the report analyze it and\nthen sort of explain it in your own ways\nbut then you're going to find yourself\ngoing down like a bunch of rabbit holes\nbecause in order to like explain things\nin a concise way like those reports are\nyou got to really know what you're\ntalking about yeah so that might be\nanother recommendation for people like\ngo check out these reports that come out\nbecause hacks happen what every day\nyeah\nevery second go go you know figure this\nout like for example i tell people\nwho want to learn how to build stuff in\nthe cloud like go find the architecture\ndiagrams and build them out be able to\nspeak to them because a lot of the stuff\nis already out there you don't really\nhave to like\ninvent or come up with some new original\nidea a lot of it is just like kind of\nlike repetition and things that are done\ndifferently maybe it's a different\nservice or things like that so there are\na couple ideas for people who are trying\nto get into get a little bit more\nhands-on with security i want to talk\nabout datadog what was so i want to talk\nabout how you got there\nand also what the interview process was\nlike yeah yeah\nso yeah it's it's quite the story um so\nit started from\nuh last year\num\naugust so this at this time i was\nsharing like all of my projects i was\nworking on on twitter so i shared on\ntwitter instagram youtube like i was\neverywhere like showing everything i was\nworking on um so\nand then you know people follow me and\nall of that like comment my stuff and\nthen my manager um he had connected with\nme on twitter and he was like really\nimpressed with the project i was working\non and it's like you know there could\nthere could be a potential internship\nopportunity on their team um for that\nsummer if um i was interested and then\num i was like at that point i actually i\nhad two offers so i had one offer for my\nlast job for the three analyst position\nand i had to offer from intel for\nsecurity engineering position i was\nactually like trying to like figure out\nwhich one i wanted to\ntake a big name right there yeah so um\nbut i was like you know like i i just i\ni eventually accepted the offer for my\num last position and then um but i was\nlike uh let's definitely like you know\nkeep in touch you know just for just for\nfuture purposes so i connected with him\non linkedin and like you know we didn't\nhave any conversations for like like\nlike about six months and i saw him so i\nthen like six months later i was at my\njob right you know i had you know gonna\npromote it to like three hours two and i\nwas like i really want to get into cloud\nsecurity and at this time i did a video\non my channel to share my goals and my\nplans like how i was going to transition\nto cloud security by the end of 2022\nlike everything i was going to do\nand then i started talking about cloud\nsecurity just doing projects and like\nstuff like that um and then he had\nposted a position about a security\nengineering position like for like one\nof their teams um um on linkedin and um\ni was like i reached out to him i was\nlike hey like um i'd like to have a\nconversation about this position it's\nlike yeah sure we had we had a zoom call\nand we talked but i wasn't really a good\nfit for that position so i actually just\nthought it was like you know i don't\nthink i have the skills for this\nposition but it was like there's\nactually another position coming up\nthat i think he thought i would be a\nbetter fit for so like just sent me a\nresume so i sent my resume and like um\nafter for a while there's like there was\nlike some hiring like um things going on\nso like um i didn't really the the\nhigher there was like a hiring phrase or\nsomething like that uh don't quote me on\nthat because i'm not exactly sure what\nhappened yeah but you know um so my my\nresume was just kind of hanging there\nfor a while uh but then like after a\nwhile he like just reached out okay like\nyou're gonna get like a recruiter reach\nout to you so it's in january so the\nwhole process kicked up in january and\nso i got the recruiter call had a\nconversation um then they set me up for\nlike a loop interview so like um like it\nwas like four interviews back to back\num and\nfor me like it was\nthe only interview that i've done\nactually not the only one but one of the\nonly interviews i've done that actually\nmade sense in the sense that you know\nlike not people just asking you\nquestions about oh what is like um you\nknow cia or stuff like that like be\nasking you questions that actually\nrelates to\nwhat you're going to be doing in your\njob and there was also like a threat\nmodeling one which is really really cool\nlike\nlike just\nwalking through a an attack scenario\nagainst the cloud environment and like\nhow you would like you know defend\nagainst that or how you like compromise\nthe cloud environment so like it just\nmade sense because that's like what i do\non a day-to-day basis so i've had an\ninterview with my director so really\ngreat interview process um\nreally uh challenging the process though\nbut um the whole process went by and\nlike after like a week got the offer and\nthen started in in march um that's kind\nof the whole story yeah now it's been\nfour months so your goal was to get to\nget into cloud security by the end of\nthis year and you like smash it like the\nfirst month like literally yeah which is\nthat's that's freaking awesome um\noh i know i know\nare you still at wgu are you still doing\nwgujust paid my tuition\nafter like six months of like not being\nin school\ni took a break yeah which is great about\nso i get a lot of questions about the\nwgu cloud because they have that with\ntracks for aws and azure and i get a lot\nof questions about the azure curriculum\ni i'm a fan of wgu i was considering\ngoing back if i had more time i don't\nknow how you do dude how do you work\nfull time we'll talk about that in a\nlittle bit but\nbut and i know now you're mentioning\nthat you went on a break but i'm curious\nabout\nlike your experience with wgu and what's\nyour opinion on the but you've changed\nprograms right like yeah you started did\nyou start in security\ni started in network operational\nsecurity which is different from the\ncyber security path\nand then i switched to the cloud program\nin december i was supposed to start that\nin january when i took my break but it\ndidn't eventually happen but before\nstarting back up this month i switched\nto the i.t program because i'm just\ntrying to finish it as fast as possible\ninteresting so like what's your opinion\non on\ngetting you just wanted to get the\ndegree because you started already or\nlike what's what's the mindset around\nthat so like i was i was going to do the\ncloud program because i was like you\nknow i'm trying to get into cloud i was\ntrying to get into cloud at that time i\nwas like the certification is the\nprogram is perfect for like building\nthose skills and like doing those\nprojects and certifications but now it's\nlike i'm in cloud i just want to get the\ndegree and like focus on my job\ninteresting so\nbut you don't have plans to like drop\njust drop it how many of how much time\ndo you have left so\nit depends yeah because i know with wgu\nit's like as much as you can take on\ni've seen people fly through some of\nthese programs but i plan to finish it\nin the next six months\neverything every day how many what is it\ncredits like do you have no what is it\nlike uh\nquitting uh units yeah how many credit\nunions you have left i think about 24\nbut like i'm like 63 done okay so all\nright that's not correct because i see\nthese people shove like the whole thing\nin six months and i was like oh my\ngoodness i mean i guess it's it's doable\nif like you have the motivation and\nstuff like that but that leads me to to\nmy last question is\nhow do you because then you you're doing\nvideos like every week now i think like\nyou're and you have two channels you got\nyour discord because you ever saw that\nyour like academy dedicated channel\nwhere you do like just strictly\ntutorials which which i'm also going to\nlink because i think those labs are\nfantastic\nso you're balancing\nfull-time work\nfull like i consider it full-time\nyoutube because just because it's one\nvideo it doesn't mean like you only do\nit like\nonce a day like working on videos is\nlike an everyday thing\num\nand then everything else outside of work\nbecause i know you're like big into\nfitness and that you're you're obviously\nyou're traveling here and stuff like\nthat so\nlet's like give everyone your best uh i\nguess tips for\nmanaging time and how do you become so\ndisciplined\nyeah i just i mean for me just um\nit's just about like\nyou know\ni don't want to sound like cliche i\nsound like like a motivational speaker\nlike all the cliche things but i mean\njust about like just um\nlike prioritization um so like at every\npoint in like\nevery stage in life i have like specific\npriorities right like for the last six\nmonths school was not my priority so i\nwas for focusing like um my work my job\nyou know and like just you know\nunderstanding like certain concepts in\nrelation to like cloud security and like\nhow that applies to like my job and\neverything like that um so like that was\nnot a priority at that time um so for me\nit's just like\npriorities and like planning your life\nand this might be where you say in like\nsprints\nso it's like it's something i started\ndoing recently so basically\nlike every three months or every four\nmonths is a sprint where you like focus\non like specific things that you really\nwant to achieve and like\nlike you know smart goals right so goals\nthat are like clearly defined and\nachievable\num and then they have like a\na pretty reasonable timeline so like\nfirst let's say first four months i want\nto get my solutions architect\ncertification right that's a reasonable\ngoal to have you know for the first four\nmonths and alongside that i'm going to\nbe focusing on like\none class per month in wg or one class\nevery two months right um just have\nthose clearly defined goals and just\nlike stick to them and then like be also\nlike be flexible with your goals um like\nif there's something that you can't\nachieve like\nfeel free to like spread out your goals\nlonger um but like also just really try\nto be dedicated and cut out\nas many distractions as possible i had a\nperiod in my life where i didn't have\nsocial media for six months and like it\nwas like it helped me get so much done\nlike i was like i i was able to i was\nable to get like my wgu program like at\nleast like almost half of it done in\nthat period of time um started getting\ninto fitness at that time so if if it\nmeans like cutting cutting out certain\nthings for a specific period of time so\nyou have more time to do what really\nmatters like in the other it would like\nthose things like you can always get\nthose things back like i could always\nget my social media back like eventually\nlike you know for me like of course\nyoutube is like a big priority but like\nif i have to like reduce like my my\ncontent like to like maybe once every\ntwo weeks or once every three weeks like\ni'll do that so i can focus in school so\nlike just prioritizing what matters and\nlike you know cut out distractions um\nand just like just try to be disciplined\nlike it's really hard to like it's\nreally hard to like be disciplined\nespecially when you have so many things\nyou're doing um but i think if you like\njust have that passion that drive um and\nlike you're a hustler like you know like\nyou can just like like thug it out and\njust like get things done um and another\nthing to just like\num i don't know if it's like\nscientifically proven but like\nif you like like motivation to do stuff\njust like start going to the gym like it\njust really pushes you to like\nespecially when you like you know make\nprs or like just like do harsh stuff\nlike it really just like pushes you\nmentally to just be able to like have\nlike grit to like go through like really\nlike you know difficult periods where\nyou have so much going on but you know\nlike at the end of it like you just come\nout a lot more fulfilled so all of those\nthings combined is what really helps me\num and like and also\nas much as possible try to sleep um\nit might be like you might feel like oh\nlike because i'm doing all these things\nlike i'm gonna only sleep like two hours\na day like sleep when you're dead yeah\nlike it's not gonna work like i i found\nout the hard way getting like good seven\nsix seven hours of sleep can really help\nyou be productive but the key to being\nproductive is like actually doing work\nwhen you're supposed to work so like if\nyou're working like don't like\ndon't be on your phone yeah like don't\nlike contact switch like spend that one\nhour\nfocus in the like that's that task get\nit done and move on to the next thing\nthat way like you can be really\nproductive so\ncut out distractions probably prioritize\num you know start going to the gym and\nsleep well and eat well\nthere you go all these things are like\nnon-tech related and and i think we tend\nto focus so much on like bullet points\non a resume or like i need to learn\nkubernetes and then tomorrow i need to\nlearn this and this and that and we\nforget that our ability to do that is\nbecause we're humans and you know what\nmakes us humans is all these things like\nyou mentioned eat well\nsleep well uh you know exercise move\nfrequently and have i'm sure i'm\nassuming you have a morning routine\nyeah sort of yeah i think that's super\nimportant like i want one like biggest\ntip for me is like start your day but\ndon't immediately make it about work\nlike i don't start work work until like\nnine in the morning but i'm up by seven\nso there's two hours it's just\nlike i'm my priority\ni think that's important too man you\ngive so much great advice it's awesome\ni'm gonna put all your links in the\ndescription um\nand any any last words you want to share\nthis video is going to be hella long but\ni think people are going to like this so\nbut any last words you want to share\nwith people who want to get into i guess\ntech in general and like security yeah i\nalways like to tell people this um i\nstarted like the last like podcast i was\nfeatured on like especially for people\nlike me if you're yelling you know maybe\nfrom like a minority group or um like\nwhatever it is like there's there are no\nlike barriers to like breaking into tech\nwhatever it is you want to do like cyber\nsecurity cloud like\ndevops whatever it is you want to get\ninto like there are no barriers like\nyour age is not a barrier like i got\ninto this like when i was 18 like and it\nnever stopped me from like you know\nworking in great positions earning you\nknow great salaries so like don't ever\nput any limitations on yourself for the\npossibilities of what you can do like\nyou know getting into the industry like\nas a freshman like or even like right\nafter right out of high school like the\nonly limitation to like your progress\nand to like your\nentry into tech is yourself and like\nyou're you can you only go as far as\nlike whatever\nuh limits you set for yourself so like\nthere are no you know barriers or there\nare no like limitations like just like\nput into work right and um you know\nbe consistent and like you eventually\nlike get what you want to get so\nperfect yeah i think the way we think of\nourselves is really the only limit that\nwe have\nuh all right thank you so much man we\ncould go on for like a really long time\nbut whenever you're back i'm gonna\ninterview you every time you come to new\nyork because i know you come here like\nwhat every\nevery quarter and then we'll like we'll\nhave like a playlist or something going\non but that would be awesome but i\nappreciate this and have all his links\nin the description peace out
