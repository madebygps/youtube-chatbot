  "transcript": "welcome\nthank you thank you for being here I\nhad mentioned to you well I guess the\nidea of you in my solution architect\nconfuses me video and then\nuh really glad that you reached out and\nyou're like hey I think you're talking\nabout me and I was like yeah I'm totally\ntalking about you but I don't want to\nmention youtrying to respect privacy but I\nappreciate you you hopping on and\nchatting with me about\nyour role and all that kind of stuff but\nwe can start from the beginning and\npeople have plenty of questions which\nwe'll try to address as many as possible\nuh but how about you start us off with\njust an introduction what do you do what\nmakes your name\nwhat do you do stuff like that like\nwhat's your elevator pitch for yourself\nsure\num my name is Kathy Lee I am a woman\nand an engineer\num I live in Portland Oregon I have been\nuh with Microsoft for almost five years\nI hit five years in September\num and yeah I uh I was hired uh at\nMicrosoft uh in 2018\nuh as a software engineer for an org\ncalled commercial software engineering\nand uh I was in that org for uh I don't\nknow two three years or something like\nthat before I moved into uh the customer\nsuccess unit the CSU where I am now as a\nCloud solution architect\num before I was at Microsoft I spent uh\nalmost a decade at the department of\nenergy\num working for the federal government is\nnot fun\num and uh yeah I mean and before that I\nsort of ping-ponged around to different\njobs I entered the job market\num in 2000 so it's really easy for me to\nyou know count back how many years I've\nbeen working as a professional 22 23 oh\nmy gosh 23. your first job\nas I guess professional adult was a\ntechra\nyes what role was it do you remember\nyeah yeah I was a software engineer\num for a startup that started off named\ngulfgateway.com and then they changed\ntheir name to greens.com\num and they were like doing like online\ntea times\nso you could you could you could book\nyour tea times online so like you know\nour our software would be implemented at\ndifferent golf courses and then these\ngolf courses would be able to let people\nschedule their Tea Times online okay so\nyou've been pretty much your entire\ncareer software engineer or software\nengineer related\nso we got years of experience did you\n23. you remember I mean we've so for\ncontext people we've had a couple of\nconversations before I know we first\nspoke maybe I was a couple months at\nMicrosoft\nuh we had like a like afraid I feel like\nwe did but we had like a conversation or\nsomething yeah I remember yep we did\nyeah I remember that and then we had one\nmore recently over the fall I believe\nand then now again but I'm very much\nalways in the know\nof what you're up to because of social\nmedia and I think it's vice versa right\num yeah yeah definitely that's kind of\nthe context of our\nuh relationship work friendship whatever\nit is\num yeah so I I we have spoken before and\nthat's why I think you were like the\nexact person to have on for this type of\ninterview because I think you\nvery easy to talk to but also\num whenever I've asked you stuff about\nyour role about tech in general it's\nnever been like an intimidating\nconversation it's always felt like very\nfriendly uh so I really appreciate that\nand I think people who are watching it\nappreciate that too\num what if we we start first\ntalking about like educational\nbackground and how did you land your\nfirst software engineering gig\nsure\num I have a pretty sort of\nI don't know\ncheckered past maybe is a way to put it\num\nso\nuh my parents uh are immigrants they\nimmigrated here from Taiwan\num and that particular wave of\nimmigration uh was sort of like that\nHighly Educated\num like wave and um so my dad was a\nprofessor at Michigan State University\nmy mom had her Masters in botany\num and they were like 100 the tiger\nparents everyone has heard of my parents\nwere totally like terrifying tiger\nparents\num in the sense of like you know I could\nnot bring home anything less than an a\nwithout like feeling scared for my lifeum and so I you know towed the line for\na really long time and I did my best and\nI you know oh Kitty and I got you know\nStraight A's\num until my junior year of high school\num I think this is probably not uncommon\nin\num you know people who are raised in\nthis kind of environment I just had a\nmental breakdown when I was 16. like I\nat 16 I was like\nPrime to be like valedictorian of my\nhigh school and like you know I was\ninvolved in uh music and like\nnot sports\nbut like I I had like a lot of things\ngoing on when I was 18. yeah yeah and\nthen um and then I had a meltdown and I\ndidn't I wasn't interested in school\nanymore and to be honest I almost didn't\ngraduate from high school\nlike that's how epically I melted down\nlike I went from almost valedictorian\nI was like I didn't oh like yeah\ngraduated from high schools because my\ntwin sister intervened for me and begged\num the government teacher to just give\nme a D minus and let me graduate\num because we had to have that like half\nsemester government class we had to pass\nit to graduate from high school and I\nwas 100 failing that class I don't think\nI even went to it once\nlike I think I spent that entire class\nlike in the parking lot of the high\nschool sleeping in my car\nyeah\nokay okay interesting and then um so my\ndad was a professor at Michigan State\nand\num he was pretty like opinionated that\nwe should all go there he was like it\ndoesn't matter where you go for\nundergrad what really matters is where\nyou go for for grad school and you you\nsee how he did that\nschool yeah you have to go to there's\nlike the expectation of course you will\ngo to grad school right he's like it\ndoesn't matter where you go to undergrad\nso I went to undergrad at Michigan State\nKicking and Screaming by the way I told\nmy parents I did not want to go to\ncollege and they were like you're nuts\nif you think you're not going to college\nso I matriculate I get into college and\num surprise surprise I flunk out like\nrepeatedly okay like I think I think I\nflunked out three times\nwow\ndid you I don't really know a college\nWorkshop but do you pick a major going\nin\nokay did you did you pick something or\nyeah I picked English literature okay\num because I really liked reading and\nwriting\num and so but I didn't go down my\nclasses so it's not like it really\nmattered what my major was okay okay\nright\num and hilariously so I used to like at\nMichigan State they're on the semester\nsystem so the semesters are very long\nlike four months long right so that's a\nlong time to like lose your\nconcentration and just stop going to\nclass which like I did like every\nsemester I went to Michigan State but\nthe Summers had really short semesters I\nthink those were like eight weeks long\nokay and so I would always take summer\nschool when I was in college and I'd\nalways get my GPA up by taking math\nclasses okay it's a little happy because\nI knew I knew I could get an A in math\neven though I was an English literature\nmajor like that was my that was my like\nhack to try and like\nnot have them kick me out balance it out\nI don't like it yeah yeah so\num anyway I I did that for like you know\nfour years or whatever like you know\nalmost flunking out flanking out\nbringing my GPA up by taking math\num and then finally uh when I was 21\num\nmy uh counselor at the time like you\nknow the person who's like helping you\nfigure out when you can graduate was\nlike okay here's the deal\nyou've done so badly\nthat you you kind of have to start over\nlike if you if you wanna if you want to\nstay at Michigan State you just kind of\nhave to start over you can't like\nthere's there's nothing we can bring\nwith us here really um yeah and I was\nlike\nwell\nif that's the case then I may as well\njust start over someplace else okay what\nI mean like why the heck am I in\nMichigan have you been there it sucks\nsorry sorry for anyone who's from\nMichigan but like or still lives in\nMichigan but like it's cold it's humid\nin the summertime the mosquitoes are\ntrying to kill you like it's just not a\nnice place so that's when I moved to\nPortland okay wait you were so living in\nMichigan right oh yeah so okay okay now\nthat makes a lot of sense all right yeah\nmy dad was a professor at Michigan State\nI went to Michigan State therefore I was\nliving like five miles from my parents\nhouse so you're like the majority of\nyour life you were living in Michiganum and up until I was 20 I was 22 when I\nmoved to Portland but up until 22 like I\nhad lived my whole life in like pretty\nmuch 10 square miles\nokay yeah okay\nokay I see I see the decision now yeah\nyeah so I was like get me out of here\num I I need a like a totally fresh start\nso I moved to Portland uh so I I decided\nat 21 that I was gonna move but I didn't\nmove until I was 22. this is 1997.\num and uh I uh start going to Portland\nState University which is sort of like a\nlike an urban University that will\naccept pretty much anybody it's it's\nlike a community college but a four-year\nschool okay what I mean okay\num like there are harder car loan\napplications that you have to fill out\nthan like the application to go to\nPortland State like it's that kind of\nUniversity\num and so I at that point I was like\nwell I don't really know what I want to\ndo okay right\num I had kind of come to the conclusion\nthat I couldn't really stick with\nEnglish literature as much as I love to\nyou know read and to write because\nyou know my parents raised me upper\nmiddle class and it just didn't do me\nany favors\nlike I was not good at being poorI also don't want to like depend on\nsomeone else for like my lifestyle right\nI like I should fund my own lifestyle no\nI know so okay yeah so I was like okay\nwhat what what skills do I have what do\nI have here like I sort of like did you\nknow what am I working with exactly and\nso I kind of did an audit of like my\nskills and I was like you know what you\nknow my dad actually forced me to learn\nabout computers when I was growing up\num and he made us like like program\nlittle programs like on five and a\nquarter inch floppy disks like whoa what\ndoes that look like what what what\nlanguage or\nI think it was basic okay I honestly\ndon't know Gwen I was like eight\nlike I don't know it was just like I was\njust like a little like terminal and I\nwould just like you know be like go\num but I was like you know I I felt like\na pretty strong\num\nI guess affinity for that like I'm like\nit's not a struggle for me to grok\ncomputer stuff okay right and at that\nage it was just like literally computer\nstuff to do right and do you remember\nenjoying it\nyeah okay it was it was like it was fun\nit was easy I almost didn't consider it\nlike for work because it didn't seem\nlike work okay do you know what I mean\nyeah it's just like fun okay so I was\nlike okay yeah I have I I have this let\nme let me do this and uh Portland State\nhad a um an information systems and\nqualitative analysis program which is\nbasically like computer science for\nbusiness people or something like this\num and so I\ndid that program\num there were CS classes that were\nrequired I think you had to take like\nthree CS classes\num and they were just like so fun like\nfor me like an absolute like breeze okay\nsee what I mean like just like\nlike this is this is coming easy this is\ncoming naturally it's way easier than\nEnglish yeah\nit's way easier than trying to like\nwrite like a 20-page paper I can imagine\nright\nnobody likes that so\num yeah I uh I I was I guess it was like\n1999 and\num I remember going to like you know\nanother sort of graduation audit and\num my counselor telling me hey you need\nto take this Logistics class okay or you\ncan't graduate\nand I was like are you freaking kidding\nme right now I totally took that class\nat Michigan State I didn't do great at\nit but I certainly did not fail it okay\num and I got a million parking tickets\nfor that class too\nso like I definitely you got that class\nyeah yeah yeah you got to get the the\nvalue out of it come on yeah totally and\nthey were like well you have to take it\nit's not we're not accepting it as an\nequivalent so you have to take it and I\njust sort of took a stand and I was like\nI'm not wow\ncollege so\nyou did College pretty much twice and\nyou still didn't graduate you didn't\nwant to graduate exactly and you know my\nuh that counselor was kind of laughing\nat me because she was like\num your uh transcript reads like someone\nwho couldn't figure anything out for\nthemselves because like I had taken so\nmany classes over like gosh was it like\nsix or seven years at this point\num I failed a lot of them I didn't fail\nall of them okay um and they were from\nall over the place right I would just be\nlike oh that class looks interesting\nI'll take it oh that class looks\ninteresting I'll take it I wasn't like\nfocused you didn't have like an end goal\nor or like oh I definitely want to go do\nthis after I graduate kind of thing yeah\nyeah I just was like oh I don't know\num and so she was like you have enough\ncredits like to like graduate for sure\nyou just don't have enough concentration\nof credits in any one place okay to\ngraduate\nokay so because I'm guessing it's like\nbecause you need to graduate in some\nspecific program or something like that\nyeah yeah\nyou're just okay that's I don't think\nI've ever heard of that situation but I\ndo feel I feel like that there's a lot\nof pressure to kind of figure out what\nyou want to do for school at such an\nearly age they think about being yeah\nlike I remember being 18 and I wanted to\nbe uh\na journalist so I wanted to get into\nthe journal as journalism is a major I\nthink it is a communication something\nlike that yeah something like that and I\nwas like this is just like the best\ndecision for my life and then I sat down\nwith my mom and she's like you're not\ngonna make any money so then there goes\nthat and then you know when you're a kid\nit's like what else are you gonna decide\nbecause that's what you are at that age\nyou're pretty much a kid it's a lot of\npressure uh coming to high school and\ntrying to figure out everything you want\nto do I don't see why more people don't\ncome out with just like a bunch of\nrandom classes like more often\nwell\nthat was my experience I wanted to be a\nhigh school English teacher that's why I\nstarted off as an English literature\nmajor so the the idea was I get my\nundergrad and English lit and then I do\na master's in education and then I'd be\nable to teach but again my parents\nraised me to upper middle class and I\njust really did not want to be poor you\nwere um yeah you were used to you I\nguess a lifestyle\nand you have to at least maintain it\nyeah yeah exactly makes sense yeah so\nyou don't graduate from college and and\nI don't how does but how do you get a\nsong you have to think about the timing\nyes I know think about the timing I know\nthat's important\nso this is 19.99 slash 2000 right yeah\nand what's happening during this time\nright it's the.com boom everyone has a\nright tech company\nyeah and people are like you hear\nstories like during that time like I got\na I got a Porsche as a siding bonus\nright I didn't know that oh yeah that\nwas that was stuff that happened back\nthen a Porsche back in 1999 as a signing\nyeah yeah yeah yeah people were people\nwere getting like crazy deals\num and at that point if you could Spell\nvisual bases they were like when can you\nstart right and I I had I had like you\nknow lots of these classes right so\num I applied for this job at the startup\ngolfgateway.com greens.com whatever it\nwas\num and they hired me well and they were\nlike you know we would like you to get\nyour degree so please work on that and I\nwas like okay but then I didn't what was\nwhat was that interview process like\noh God I don't even remember yeah like\nthis was\nalmost 25 years ago now but like\nit must have been nerve-wracking yeah I\nhad no idea\nyou got it yeah I would love to know\nlike how did you answer the questions or\nwhat the questions look like or or like\nall of that like do you remember like\nyou know struggle or anything like that\nlike this this is for sure what I know\nabout that job it was all in C plus plus\nokay did you have any any experience\nwith C plus at all before like maybe any\ncollege oh yeah I mean well well see see\nokay not C plus plus okay um because\nlike all of our computer science classes\nin college were in C\num so\nlike I at least was familiar with like\nthe basic constructs of the language\num yeah absolutely yeah that that job\nwas all in C plus plus I mean this will\ndate me severely but like\nI was at least two years into my career\nbefore c sharp came out okay interesting\nso that's so funny how old it's a fun\nfact\ndo you feel like so you learned all your\nprogramming knowledge in college or did\nyou learn oh hell no outside of you\ndon't know you don't learn anything in\ncollege let's be honest\nno no no no no no college does not\nprepare anyone for professional work to\nbe fair I learned C plus plus the two\nsemesters that I wasn't in college okay\nnot C plus plus the basics to program I\nwould say\nI think I had a really cool teacher\nthough and he was the only one who kind\nof saw any potential in me and\nand he would just give like the hardest\nhomework like once you were out of class\njust for his class you would literally\nspend every single because I had the\nclass Maybe\nlike four times a week\num you would spend like six hours doing\nhis homework because it was like you\nhave to go code the exercise and even if\nit was as simple as like oh code a\nprogram that will calculate I don't know\nsome formula like you had to rock that\nright documentation so they would write\na word doc like table of contents um\nglossary and like oh screenshots uh FAQ\nall that kind of stuff even if the\nprogram was like five lines so he really\nlike\nkicked their butts with that class but I\nfelt like I learned a lot because of\nthat but then again that sounds the bass\nsounds useful yeah yeah the basics\nabsolutely and obviously I picked up\nmore later on working but I guess I have\nto be fair give give credit where Chris\ndo but I didn't go to college here I\nwent to college in Ecuador well you know\nthe two semesters so maybe there's I've\nfrom what I've known that educational\nsystem is a little bit more difficult\neven though it's like such a small and\nunknown country\num\nbut yeah gotta get credit where credits\ndo\nwe'll we'll get into this a little bit\nlater when we talk about my job but my\nexperience was all Engineers from Latin\nAmerica is they are\na plus okay so there must be something\ngoing on that's crazy there must be\nsomething going on in those Educational\nSystems okay but yeah we'll touch on\nthat later yeah so so what's this first\ngig like like how long did you last like\nwhat what was your day-to-day life I\nlasted as long as the company lasted\nwhich was six months\nthey went belly up in six months so and\nyou know the the funny thing is like\nI've seen your videos where you talk\nabout the progression of your salary\num and that job\num offered me 35 000 a year which I felt\nlike was a million dollars you're good\nyeah yeah yeah yeah I was like holy holy\ncrap I have so much money\num so with that six months of experience\num I moved on to another startup okay\nright okay and that other startup\noffered me sixty thousand dollars I was\nlike\nif at 35 you're rich oh you could like\nretire I like this that like I almost\ndoubled my salary in like six months\nright I was just like what's going on\nthis is amazing how much time was there\nbetween like the other company like I\nguess you leaving or you know ending the\njob at the first company to the second\none well this was still the.com boom\neven though greens.com went Belly Up\nLike This was still like you know the\nbot the the Boom is happening and so I\nwas snatched up pretty quickly\num there was hardly any time off between\njobs I and I want to say maybe there\nwasn't any time off between jobs okay\num and I I worked there for a year I\nthink at this next startup\nat this next startup okay\num and then this startup went Belly Up\nas well\num and it was a um it was sort of like a\nfinancial services application\num and so after that\num I got a job at um a company called\ncarillion\num which did like online banking\nsoftware so because I already had had\nthe experience with like the financial\nsystem software they hired me\num as again software engineer\num and uh that was I think in like 2001\num so and I worked there for two years\num and that was where uh well I\nshouldn't say that the job before that\nwas where I met Scott Hanselman that's\nanother fun fact I guess our\nuh how we first got to talk to each\nother was through having that Mutual\nconnection with Scott uh you have a warm\nintroduction the warm handoff the warm I\ndon't know what it's called the worm\nintroduction yeah yeah that um you\nobviously have many many more years of\nFriendship with Scott and uh it was\nsomething that was I guess interesting\nuh how\nand I guess we have that in common\num what what was the what was like\nlike the perks and stuff like that at\nthese kinds of jobs back then because\nyou know now that's like a big thing\nabout working in techs like sign on\nbonuses free lunches stuff like that no\nperks nothing just like kind of like\nstand up jokes\nno perks\num\nat greens uh uh yeah no perks we were in\nlike Suburban hell uh like strip mall\nkind of area\num and and then the financial services\nstartup\num\ndefinitely no perks\nthe biggest perk was that the office\nbuilding was next to a really good\nCambodian restaurantso\nwhat what's what's the scene like is it\nvery much you know now like the\nstereotypical ping pong tables arcade\ngames in the offices none like\nit was just cute\nland all right okay that's just cute\nland there's there's no there's there's\nno common area there's no nothing it's\njust Cube Land\num and at carillion\num\nit was like they had an uh an actual\nkind of like campus where they had I\nthink like three buildings\num and so they had like more like a\nbetter sort of like\nI don't know common area space but\nthere's still no ping pong table there's\nno free beverages there's no like free\nlunch there's none of that like actually\nthe biggest perk of that company was um\nwhen I got a puppy they let me bring my\npuppy to workall right cool what what's the uh what\nwas the work-life balance like was that\na thing back then was that like you know\nhow that's like a buzzword now I guess\num\ndo you feel like people were working\nextra\nuh was it like sort of accepted like\nthat type of thing or I don't know I\nfeel like at that point\num you know the whole uh I.T people\nworking too hard thing hadn't really\ncrested\num\nI can only speak from my experience like\nI have a 20-something person yeah what\ndo you know about making money for the\nfirst time\nI was not about work\nlike I did my work I got it done okay I\nfeel like I was pretty good employee but\nlike like when it was time to go home it\nwas time to go buy a puppy at home I had\nfriends you know we had to go to the\nclubit's funny to think about now but that's\nthat's\nwhat I did back then more important\nthings to dothen was was that second gig C plus plus\nas well\nyes okay all right so now you've got\nsome pretty\npretty good like what like a over a year\ntwo about two years of these plus plus\nexperience that's that's got to be good\nfor the resume\nthat doesn't matter anymore but sure I\nhaven't touched C plus plus since then\nokay interesting all right so let's so\nafter this this gig\nwhat what comes after that\nso I was at carillion for uh like a\ncouple years so this is now my third job\nout of school okay\num and then that's when the bust\nhappened\nright the.com bust okay\nso that was that long I thought it was\nquicker to be honest\noh yeah no I mean it kind of like slowly\nbusted but when it busted it like really\nbust okay\num so there was a period of time 2002\n2003 where like I remember I was a party\num\nand you know the party is like a whole\nbunch of like 20-something I.T\nprofessionals like myself you know and\num like no one at this party had a job\nunemployedokay that's how bad it was that's how\nbad it was I feel like\nmight be\nget to that I was about to ask you like\nthat kind of sounds like it feels it\nstarts to feel familiar\nyeah because I was starting to we were\ntalking about this before but I was like\nI'm starting to freak out what where\nwe're at but then again I haven't been\nthrough anything\nsimilar at all\num but then I wanted to ask you like\nwhat what does it feel like now compared\nto what you've been through before\nwell it feels familiar because all the\nsignals are all the same oh my God right\nyou get the same like economic signals\nyou get the same like\num like Rumor Mill going crazy kind of\nstuff like when the when the rumor world\nstarts going crazy you know it's like\nfor a reason like like when I was early\nin my career I might have like been like\noh that's just a rumor like there's\nthere's nothing concrete so why\nspeculate\num but now that I've been through this a\ncouple of times like\nI I don't I still don't take it as\nanything concrete yeah but you know that\nwhen those rumors are happening it's\nlike a sign that something's really yeah\ngoing on okay um they don't they don't\nstart for no reason\num is I guess what I mean but um\nyeah no uh it it all fell apart in 2002\n2003. I think I was unemployed for like\nsix months\nwere you after curling trying to get\ngigs like you were just oh I was okay\nokay oh I was what about likewise was\nthere like um indeed or stuff like that\nthen there was dice no\ndice.com was around there was no indeed\num\nthere were you know recruiters\num about was been around\num\nso you could work with different\nrecruiting companies\num\nyou know you could you could troll dice\num and because pretty much everyone I\nknew was unemployed as well like we were\nall just trying to like help each other\nout yeah you know like hey I found this\nposting it looks like something you\ncould do or you know someone would send\nme something similar\num I actually have some like friends\nfrom that time that like like stick with\nme to this very day because we all sort\nof went through that together and it was\nvery like it was very hard yeah\num yeah six months unemployed like I had\nno no one like to depend on you know I\nwas single\num\nmy parents were like you're an adult\nso rightly so we are not going to give\nyou money\num\nand yeah so I was just like on my own\nand it just felt really scary\num but I did find something eventually\num there was a few like weird things in\nthere I'm not even gonna talk about that\nbecause it was so weird but um I did\neventually and end up at this place that\nwas pretty hilarious called Blackwell\nbook Services okay\num we called it the Blackwellum it was a very depressing place like\nvery depressing\num like even like the work environment\nwas like old do you know what I mean\nlike old acoustic ceilings everything\njust kind of looked a little dirty like\nit was just like just just a sad\ndepressing place\nbut at the time I was just like I just\nneed to work I just need to make money\nso I was like thrilled with that job I\nhad it for I think like two or three\nyears C plus plus as well\nno that one was Visual Basic so this is\nyour introduction into Microsoft land\nwell curling was also Microsoft it was\nalso visual based okay okay and we did\nstart\num because Scott worked at carillion\num at the time he wasn't working for\nMicrosoft but he was the regional\ndirector\num for uh like the Portland area I think\nmaybe the Pacific Northwest anyway\num so he he was like pushing you know\nMicrosoft stuff and um we all sort of\nlike learned C sharp together on that\njob so you have\na lot of c-sharp experiences then now\ntoo yes okay cool yes cool\num before we move on I wanted to ask I\nguess for myself like you know that time\nof going through like not having a job\nlike if you look back at it can you\nthink of any advice you'd give someone\nwho might go through that\nI don't know maybe someone listening\nthis is going through a layoff or\nsomething\nyeah uh the the number one thing I will\nsay is you have no idea how long this\nwill last okay so don't blow all of your\nSeverance money on drinking too much\nbecause you need to blow off steam which\nis what I did\nwhich is what I did I love I love the\nrealness of this I mean I was in my 20s\nyeah everyone I know was laid off like\nwe were drinking so much what was the\nseventh like it was a couple months pay\nyeah it wasn't much I think I got like a\nmonth oh okay yeah okay yeah but I blew\nit I blew it all like so fast on\ndrinking so how did you survive like a\ncup of noodles and some bread or\nsomething pretty much so you know you\nget unemployment yeah right yeah yeah\nand unemployment was just about enough\nfor me to pay my rent\num paying my car payment and buy\ngroceries but my groceries were like\nRamen yeah ketchup yeah\nyeah like beans and rice rough kind of\ndiet all right yeah I like yeah\nI like the the I guess be smart with\nyour money generally yeah yeah just you\nI mean you you have no idea how long the\nseason will last right like I remember\nthinking at the time\num that I don't know however people\nwatched Seinfeld but I was like I could\nhave a summer of Georgeyou've ever seen it but uh George\nCostanza gets laid off and he's like so\nexcited he's like I'm gonna have to\nSummer of George so I was like yeah I'm\ngonna have the summer of George I got\nlaid off I think in the summer and so I\nwas like I'm just gonna like\nhave a good time spend my Severance\nmoney like drink with my friends party\nlike whatever and then the dark winter\nmonths hit and I realized that I'm broke\nI'm hungry I'm hungry I haven't eaten\nlike a decent meal in Forever\num and I have no idea how long this is\ngonna last like my my thought when I was\ninitially laid off was\num to that point you know all of my job\nexperience had been like I find a job\nreally fast yeah right so why would that\nbe different right I was just like oh\nI'll find a job whenever I whenever I'm\nready to find one like it'll just be\nlike they're waiting for me and I may as\nwell just enjoy the summer take the\nsummer off and then when the Summer's\nover then I'll start looking for a job\ndo you and do you recommend people just\nif it does happen just immediately get\nto trying to find another thing\nI mean I think it depends on a lot of\nthings yeah right\num it depends on how much Severance you\nget like some people I know who have\nbeen laid off recently have gotten like\nmonths and months and months of\nseverance like I would tell those people\ntake a freaking vacation yeah try and\nget the burnout off of you right feel\nlike refreshed and ready to work yeah\nexcited to work not like dreading okay\nright you want to wait until you have\nthat feeling of okay now I'm ready I'm\nexcited I want to work\num\nbut those are also the people who tend\nto have more experience and so those are\nthe people easier for them generally\nyeah yeah have less trouble finding a\njob but I would say that if you're a\njunior person and you have the horrible\nluck of being laid off in this\nenvironment yeah get on it like get like\nlike press your network immediately\nlike be relentless yeah I mean Juniors\ntend to have the energy to do that\nanyway so I guess that kind of works in\ntheir favor\num yeah yeah but Juniors also have a lot\nof things working again against them\nright like I have I have almost 25 years\nof a network to Leverage\ndo you know what I mean I'm gonna call\nyou if something happens to me\na lot of people call me when things\nhappen to them for that reason because I\nknow a lot of people yeah\num and I've been in the industry a\nreally long time and\num\nso yeah like\nbut if you're a junior then you know\nyou're going to tend to have a much\nsmaller Network yeah I think the reality\nis like it is just gonna suck like I\ndon't want to put like a fake positivity\nspin to it it's just just it's better to\nbe real than kind of get let down or\nyeah there's going to be a lot of pain\nyeah um already or like it's already\nhappening\nyeah there has been pain and there's\nmore pain to come yeah and we don't know\nwhen the pain will stop we'll end yeah\nbut we do know it will end at some point\nokay there's a nice positive spin to it\nyeah yeah\nso this this what did you say this is a\nbook place Blackwell Blackwell's\nBlackwell book services using visual\nstudio already on a Visual Basic\nand you were there for I think you\nmentioned a couple years two three years\nsomething like that two three years did\nyou enjoy the work\nno no but you're just doing it\nabsolutely not we were we were replacing\na mainframe system\nand it was like an it was like an Erp\nso it's like ordering bookslike this is not exciting work yeah no I\nmean like a startup or anything riveting\nor like you're changing no no and um\nyeah it was like I said it was a very\ndepressing place to work\num\nthere are people there who had been\nworking there for like 30 years though\nso it was one of those kinds of places\nyou know what I mean like one of those\nlike smaller companies where people just\nlike stay forever and they like never\nleave\num and I was very worried\nabout being sucked into the Blackwell\nokay yeah you're very aware of like you\ncan't you can't stay there too long or\nyou will be sucked into the blood\nforever become one of those people who\njust stay there\nyeah okay interesting what um\ndid you did this place close as well or\ndid you leave\nno I I left because at that point the\neconomy had recovered\nand I had other options right so this is\nwhat I'm saying do you remember around\nit's like 2004 or five-ish\nyes because then isn't there like\nanother economy downfall a few years\nafter like 2008\n2008 8 was when I was already working\nfor the federal government and the\nfederal government's pretty shielded\nfrom that kind of like recession cycle\nokay okay\num\nso yeah I left I left the Blackwell to\nwork for a company called TransCore\nwhich does like Logistics software and\nit's also not fun at all like it was\nsocial how can I get my truck from A to\nB to pick up another thing like yeah\nthat's what it was and it was it was uh\nc-sharp okay okay C sharp did you like\nbecause you now you have like C plus\nplus C sharp Visual Basic was did you\nhaving worked with all them would you\nstarting to grow like a preference for\none or you didn't care oh my God C sharp\nall the way okay okay I'm still I'm\nstill c-sharp all the way it continually\nlike frustrates me that I am a c-sharp\ndeveloper and at Microsoft the company\nthat created the language I never get to\nuse it yeah I was I when you mentioned\nthat last time we spoke I was somewhat\nsurprised I know you keep telling me\nthat you keep waiting for like a.net\nengagement to come up and it just\ndoesn't happen to you\nI'm still waiting yeah\nbut the\nso this company that you're at you're\ndoing C sharp in\nlike what does that look likeum it's mostly back endthis is before rest uh was releasing\num so yeah we're just we're just writing\nlike back-end Services\num we also had like a Java team that\nalso wrote some back-end services that\nwe had to integrate with Integrations I\nthink are always fun I always love\nIntegrations what is what does that look\nlike then though like because you know\nhow you know microservices are a big\nthing now was what were is it primarily\njust like monoliths things like that\nyeah yeah yep do you do a lot of\nmicroservices stuff now\nyes do you have a preference yeah a lot\nof my job is uh breaking up monoliths\nokay into into microservices yeah that's\na lot of people's like modernization\nplan do you\nso you know having worked you know in\nthese jobs with all monoliths I'm\nassuming that experience really helps\nyou now with what you do now\nyeah I mean it's all additive so yeah\nyeah like it I love it love it okay so\nhave you have you used Java did you use\nJava back then have you I didn't use\nJava back then but I have had to use it\nat work here you don't sound too excited\na lotJava Man\nit's something\nit's something it Compares it gets\nCompares a lot to c-sharp I mean it gets\ncompared I don't know if it's fair but\nit does yeah\num\nyeah I once like it was like 7 p.m and I\nwas still working and I was working on a\nan engagement that uh was Java Centric\nand um I just needed to add one hour to\nan hour\nhow the freaking hard can this be\ndo you know what I mean like this cannot\nbe that hard I spent an hour trying to\nfigure this out before I finally was\njust like you know what I don't even\ncare how stupid I'm gonna sound but I'm\ngonna ask one of my co-workers for help\neven though it's like 8 p.m at this time\nthey're still working\nbecause we're we can be bad about\nwork-life balance during customer\nengagements but I was like help me\nhow do I add an hour to an hour in Java\nlike I like in.net this is like\nliterally a dot yeah you know ad\nparentheses one like like this should it\nshould be this easy like I don't know\nwhy this is so hard\num and it made me feel a little bit\nbetter that it did take him like a\nlittle bit of time to figure it out as\nwell we just couldn't figure out that we\ncouldn't find the right Library we\nneeded to get us what we wanted you did\na library for that interesting yeah yeah\nI'm assuming he has like more job\nexperience that's like his thing no I\nthink he just has better Google okay\nlove it love it we'll get into more\nabout like\num\nbattle Dynamic of because I remember I\nwas talking about your your role and how\nit's like you kind of always have\nsomeone who can help you out\non your team which I really like\num and you have like maybe similar skill\nsets but you might shine a little bit\nmore in one area someone might have like\nsomething else and I think that's really\ncool we can get more into that when we\ntalk about your current role so all\nright so you leave this um what's up\nwhat's the job right now so you left\nBlackwell TransCore the transportation\nthing and then yeah you get into the\ngovernment after\nyep\nwhat was that like every you know I get\na lot of questions about government work\npeople for some reason have a lot of\ninterest in it so I would love to hear\nmore about it yeah I mean there's\nthere's there's a lot of reason to be\ninterested in it which I have already\nmentioned which is uh mostly immune to\nyeah economic Cycles right which would\ninclude recession so if you're looking\nfor a job that is like extremely stable\nlike extremely stable then the\ngovernment is the place for you yeah\nyeah like\num\nI uh like if you're a government\nemployee like you get a pension\nwho gets pensions anymore do what I mean\num it's like it's like bizarre like that\nbut yeah I mean when I was working at\nthe government I I would often joke with\npeople that it would take an act of\nCongress for me to lose my job\nand that wasn't 100 false\nyeah so I can imagine it also wasn't 100\ntrue but it wasn't 100 policy therewhat how hard was it to land the job\npretty hard okay but also why\nwhy did you want to go\nI guess into that set like\nsector after\nyou know going through some professional\nturmoil\nit was appealing okay to work for a\nplace that's stable\num\nand\nyeah so I started off as a contractor\nwhich was pretty easy for me to get that\njob\num it would be similar to like you know\npeople starting at Microsoft as like a\nv-dash right and then you know if you're\na contractor or a vdash then you just\nAspire for that you know like full badge\nright like I think at Microsoft it's a\nblue badge a BPA was like a green badge\num but you just want that badge that\nshows like yeah I'm like legit like I\nreally work here\num and\nit took me a long time to convert to\num a full-time employee what are we\ntalking with the government a couple\nyears\nyeah okay is that yeah typical\nsome people like my friend Michelle I\njust saw on LinkedIn she finally got\nconverted\nshe's been working there for like 20\nyears oh my goodness contractorwow yeah yeah it can take forever some\npeople never convert is the is the\nstability also extended to contractors\nor is it just like no no yeah okay\nabsolutely not so that the goal is if\nyou're a contractor yeah yeah if you're\na contractor you're constantly living on\na knife's edge\nokay that's gonna be tough\nyeah\nokay so you you you land the so to land\nthe contract what did you just apply or\nlike pretty much yeah I was like through\na like you know contracting company I\nthink it was like\nuh Tech Systems yeah it was Tech Systems\num tech systems and\nyeah I feel like that sounds familiar\nhave they been around for a while yes\nright yeah yeah yeah yeah okay they're\nNationwide they may even be\nInternational I don't know\num but yeah they've been around for a\nlong time and um\nthey were they were like BPA used like a\nwhole bunch of vendors\num Tech system was was just one of them\nokay so uh yeah I worked as a contractor\nfor uh yeah two three years something\nlike that before I converted\num and then once I converted uh it was\nseven and a half years almost exactly\nbefore going on moving on to your next\nnext thing before moving on to Microsoft\nokay so the at this government gig was\nit c-sharp\nyes the whole time\nyes and to get to Contra from contractor\nto full time did you have to like work\nreally hard what was it was it luck what\nwhat do you think\num\nlet's just say this it's not\nparticularly hard to differentiate\nyourself at the government okay\ninteresting okay yeah most people are\njust phoning it ininteresting to know what what can you\nsay about the work there like and like\nnow that you've worked you know you've\nworked a startups you worked the\ngovernment now at like a big company\nwhat do you think is like the major\ndifference working there versus the\nothers\nwell you know the government is very\nlocked down in terms of like tools you\ncan use right so like I couldn't just\nlike download something off the internet\nand be like let me try this and see how\nit works like you know I don't know\nexactly what would have happened if I\nhad like downloaded something but like\nprobably\nlike sirens would have started and like\nhelicopter security would have showed up\nyeah just like escort me out of the\nbuilding like\num yeah it was like it was pretty it was\npretty locked down\num and Innovation is not it's not a\nthing that exists\nthey're working on Ancient decrepit\nLegacy systems that they're just keeping\naliveand after a while you start to feel like\na dinosaur yourself did you care about\nthat did you care about not working on\nlike the latest and greatest did okay I\ndid okay did you always or just was it\nat that job that you realized that you\ncared\njob if I realized that I cared\nbecause I was like\nyou know at a certain point if you're a\ngovernment employee\nyou have to look yourself in the face\nand be like\ndo I intend to stay here for my entire\ncareer or not\nright am I going to be a lifer or am I\ngoing to be someone who like leaves and\nI knew that I was never going to be a\nlifer like I just could not turn into\nsome of those zombies that I saw okay\nlike like\nthe place is crawling with them\nand you know that did you know that\ngoing into it or is it something that\nyou realized once you were in no I did\nbecause I was a contractor right so I\nsaw it as a contractor I just didn't\nrealize it would bother me so much as an\nemployee right yeah because some people\nit's probably fine for them it's like\nwhat they want\nyeah yeah but\nso yeah I I was like\nI'm not gonna stay here forever\nand whenever it is that I want to leave\nmy skills will be\nirrelevant\nto like the modern workplace okay right\nlike yes I was doing c-sharp development\num but we couldn't do anything new\nso we couldn't use any new tools so what\nwere you using\ndo you remember\num\nalso nice\nbut it it ends up being like not so nice\nso like um like\nyou know we're using c-sharp visual\nstudio uh TFS we switched um\nwe switched from Source safe to TFS when\nI was working there like they were using\nSource safe\nlike okay so\nwas that switch like a big thing was it\na big deal\noh it was it's a huge migration oh my\nGod it was it was intense\num and like you know there are things\nlike um\nlike there we would ask questions like\nhey can we can we try to modernize some\nof these like newer services that we're\nbuilding by like making them like\nrestful services or like you know we\nhave this like quick little like\napplication we need to write that's like\ninternal only can we like maybe try to\ndo like angular or a single page\napplication like something fun like\nanything can you give us anything and\npeople be like no\njust the answer to any question like\nthat was no\nbecause and it was just because I guess\nbecause he's\nlike these web Frameworks were newer\nthat's pretty much it why they\nthey said no okay yep\nfear fear of anything new\nyeah yeah I mean I guess stability plays\na thing there\nor\nI mean I can't see what what else it\nwould be\nperformance no\nI really don't know I don't know why\nthey were the way that they were to be\nhonest I really don't and then oh I was\ngoing to tell you because I commented on\none of your videos because you did that\nrejection video\nright so when I was working at\nBonneville\num I hated it like I hated it I hate\nevery day I hated it I was like this\nplace I'm gonna turn into one of these\nzombies like government\nyeah okay yeah okay yeah yeah\num and so I applied for a job at GitHub\nhow many years in to the government job\nI think\ngosh I want to say four okay so about\nhalfway let's say yeah halfway halfway I\napply for this job at GitHub\num and\nI wanted this job so was it sulfur\nsulfur Dev\nokay yeah it was working on their Visual\nStudio integration okay the GitHub\nintegration with Visual Studio cool\num and uh God I wanted this job I\nit was one of those things where like\nmy dream was so big like you could see\nit\nit was such this big dream\num and I could taste it like how bad I\nwanted it\num and I got so far like I I talked to\nsomeone who\nworks or worked at the time for GitHub\nthey don't anymore but um I talked to\nthem and they were like\nif you get an interview like it like you\nknow the the whole like panel interview\nthing you know not just like the first\nor second interview but the interview\nthey really spend like a lot of time\nwith you he was like if you get that far\nyou're pretty much guaranteed the job\nokay like they don't let people in that\nfar unless they're pretty sure about\nthat yeah okay okay\num and so I got that far\nand so like my hopes are like way up\nyou're like right yeah I was like I'm\ngonna I'm gonna get this job like I can\nfeel it I'm gonna get this job\num did I feel like I aced the interview\nabsolutely not\nbut I did I was like well I got this far\nso like this is gonna be good and um\nyou know I had a few conversations with\nthe hiring manager and you know she was\nlike I have to say like we're really\nreally conflicted about you\num and we don't really know how to\nproceed okay and\nthey\nhamdenhud went back and forth with me\nfor I want to say like six months and\nthen finally they were just like yeah\nit's not gonna happen six months why\nit's a long time I don't know\nbut was there like constant\ncommunication or it was like maybe every\nmonth no I mean I\nyou know how it is as a job Seeker you\ndon't want to seem like too eager yeah\nyeah right it's like it's almost kind of\nlike dating yeah should I text her oh I\ndon't know I don't know I don't wanna I\ndon't want to seem desperate right so\nyou don't want to seem desperate at the\nsame time you want to keep the the lines\nof communication open right there's like\na fine line between like keeping the\nlines of communication open but not\nseeming desperate yeah yeah um so I I\nwould try and ping like you know at\nfirst I pinged like once a week and then\nafter a while I think I just like slowed\ndown to once a month and then after I\nthink like the last email I sent like\nwas like probably like two months and I\nI it was mostly just like a verification\nlike I just wanted I wanted them to say\nconfirmed we are rejecting you yeah no\nyeah um and they did they're like\nthey're like confirmed we are rejecting\nyou and I was like okay but that whole\ntime probably you're still working in at\nthe back of your mind it's like any day\nnow I'm out of here any day now kind of\nthing no I mean maybe at first okay\nmaybe at first but like you know like a\nmonth a month of waiting you're like\nyeah you know what's happening yeah yeah\nmaybe means no\nokay right interesting\nyeah do you feel that like with every\nkind of I guess job\nopportunity I mean Oprah says that so I\nfeel like it's just it's just something\nthat's true\nI mean it comes back to the dating thing\nif someone's not sure about you it's\nkind of like an obvious answer type of\nthing okay I like interesting so\nyou apply to GitHub and how many\nI guess you have like what two three\nyears left that you do at the government\ngig and then why do you apply to\nMicrosoft or why and how\nOkay so\nwe had\num\nsomeone coming to uh Bonneville for like\na TFS training or something okay right\nto give and to get to give us to give us\ntraining okay right and um I saw the\nemail come into my inbox hey you know we\nwe want everyone to go to this thing\nand and I was like oh\nMicrosoft\nI want to work there\nbut I was like but they would never hire\nme okay okay why would they ever hire me\nyeah yeah so so and then I was like they\nprobably don't even have any jobs in\nPortland anyway so I you know the like I\ngo home at the end of that night and\njust like on a lark\nI look up you know Microsoft jobs in\nPortland Oregon and I find one\nand Commercial software Engineers\nsoftware engineer gig okay\nso\num I text our friend Scott Hanselman\nand I asked him yeah\nshould I apply for this job I send him\nthe link should I apply for this job and\nScott replies hell yeah\napply for that job and he was like and I\nknow the hiring manager so I can give\nyou that warm introduction right I love\na good one direction\nand like within like\nfew days I was talking on the phone with\nthe hiring manager and he was fast\ntracking Me For Hire what so um\nI think I had that first conversation\nwith him in July\nand my first day at Microsoft was like\nSeptember 3rd\nokay pretty pretty CR uh like two months\nlike two months two months yeah yeah and\nI'm assuming a lot of that is like\nbackground check and stuff like that yep\nexactly\nwas he was the interview process long do\nyou remember\nit wasn't long at all I had three\ninterviews\num all like on teams\num and\nthey were all like like one person kind\nof asked me like maybe one hard question\nbecause\nlike uh was like a technical thing or\nokay yeah like one one technical\nquestion but like mostly they just asked\nme about my experience right well you\nhave a lot like a lot of it by then\nyeah so they're just like tell me about\nyour experience so I told them about my\nexperience and you know they they asked\nyou the typical things like you know\nwhat was challenging about that and of\ncourse you lived through it so you can\nanswer that pretty easily but like it\nwasn't any like live coding it wasn't\nany like did you do any of it none of\nthat\nzeroyes okay\ninteresting different approaches there\nyes yes\num and then my last interview I'll never\nforget this was this guy who spent the\nentire interview just talking\nit's like about the day or something\nI've ever had\nwe ran out of time withit I haven't asked you anything do you\nhave any questions for me and I was like\nwell we're out of time so yeah I got I\ngot another thing I guess if I start at\nMicrosoft I'll ask you there\nall right so do you do you hear back\npretty\nI was like soon like right after your\ninterview\nyeah I feel like it was like\ndays later like maybe three days later\num I got the phone call\num that you know they want to give me a\nverbal offer yeah cool when you yeah\nwhen you saw the the like the post of\njob posting and you saw the like the\ndescription the response like nobody\nthey call it requirements\nresponsibilities whatever they're called\ndid you feel like you met the majority\nof them\nbut you applied anyway\nScott told me okay\nyeah Scott told me something hilarious\nactually\nhe was like you need a channel you're a\nmediocre your inner mediocre white dude\nand apply for a job you're not qualified\nfor\nI think I've heard him say something\nsimilar to that as well\num\nyeah I think I mean it's it's pretty\nreal advice\nyeah so you went for it and you got it\nwhich is yeah I went for it I mean I was\njust like this is this is absolutely\nridiculous right because like I'm\napplying for a job in commercial\nsoftware engineering and Commercial\nsoftware engineering\num you know helps customers like onboard\nAzure right\num\nhad I ever used Azure no\ndid I know anything about Azure no like\nof course like before my interviews I\ndid my due diligence and I kind of like\nstudied as quickly as I could just like\njust get some like basic concepts but\nthey were very basic yeah I can imagine\nI can imagine like very very very basic\nI was like I know a C sharpall right so so you you start you start\nthe new gig\num\ndo you like hit the hit the ground\nrunning with with work what is it what\nis\nwhat is the role even like what did you\ndo what did it look like\nwhen I first started yeah\num I was what was known then as a\nsoftware engineer\nin industry or SEI\num okay so so this this was Glenn this\nis kind of the funny part so like\nI left the government because I hated it\nso much right yeah and so I start\nin Microsoft in the government industry\ndid you know that that's where they\nthat's where they decide to put me I\nmean\nI knew when they offered it to me okay\nand I wasn't gonna like turn it down\nyeah no do what I mean yeah but I was\nlike you've got to be kidding me it\nfollows like I wanted to escape from the\ngovernment and you're giving me a job\nbasically like\nlike still working with governmentum\nbut yeah so we were we were working with\ngovernment\num you know we we I did a lot of proof\nof concepts for customers like I did a\nlot of like devops demos and um some\ncool sort of like cognitive Services\ndemos\num and\num a lot of it was like\num like you because we were assigned an\nindustry and not really like a solution\narea right so like I'm I'm I would\ncharacterize myself as more like an\napplications developer and like I know\nvery little about things like networking\nright like\nto this day I really struggle with\nnetworking I was just talking to some\nfriends about that I was like oh\num but I'm not a networking like CSA now\nso like it's not like part of my job but\nanyway\num but I had like this this big\num\ncustomer like within government that\nlike needed a lot of like networking\nlike Express routes and like v-nuts and\nall this stuff\num and and like I didn't know anything\nabout it so like you know I had to like\nfind someone in CSE that had that\nexpertise and then and then you know\norganize things enough to bring them in\nand give them the context and like you\nknow have them work with the customer\nand like all that stuff so a lot of my\njob was uh actually like not even that\ntechnical because if I couldn't\ntechnically do the work then at least I\nhad to orchestrate it orchestrate the\nthat the people okay that could do the\ntechnical work did that mean that you\nwould still have to come up with like a\ncon like the concept or like the\nsolution and kind of give it to someone\nelse or\nno I mean what what could I say about a\nnetwork topology so you would have to go\nfind someone to do it yeah I think okay\ninteresting\nhow\nhow frequent how common was that for I\nguess amongst the team\npretty common I mean most often you were\nnot given you know an engagement that\nhad anything to do with like your\nparticular skill set so a lot of the\nseis were just like we spent a lot of\nour time not actually doing\nimplementations but actually like\nrunning around trying to find people to\nhelp us\num but we also got to do like a lot of\nreally fun group of Concepts so I really\nliked that that was my favorite part of\nthat job proof of Concepts means\nyou just built like okay so what does\nthat process look like like making a\nproof concept where do you get the idea\nfrom is do you have like an initial\nconversation with a customer for that\ngather required yeah so like one of the\nmost fun proof of Concepts I did was\nactually for Warner Brothers Warner\nmedia\num and they have like you know tons of\nlike video assets as you can imagine\nright and they distribute these video\nassets internationally and when they do\nthat they have to you know put foreign\nsubtitles right\non on their on their uh video assets\num and they had no real automated way of\ndoing this it was all very like manually\nlike done and like painstaking\num\nand what they really wanted was to\nleverage cognitive services to\num give them like an 80 there right they\nknew it wasn't going to be perfect right\nout of the gate\num idioms will be messed up you you know\nyou've watched probably movies with like\nthat are in Spanish and you're reading\nthe crappy English subtitles you're like\nyeahyeah yeah who came up with this like I I\ndo the same thing when I watch Chinese\nmovies with English subtitles I'm like\nlike someone's talking for like two\nminutes and you get like a one sentence\ntranslation right like it's like never\nreally what they said but anyway\num but I get it they wanted something\nyeah yeah they want something like 80\nthere\num so they they um I had a meeting with\na customer they they\num they told me like hey we have this\nproblem where we have all these assets\nwe need to subtitle them we don't have\nan automated way to do it\nAzure has cognitive Services we would\nlike to see a demonstration of this in\naction okay\num and so I was like okay that sounds\ngreat it would be awesome if you could\ngive me like you know some\num sample of like some shorter video\nassets that I can subtitle for you\num using cognitive services and they\ngave me like I think like 10\num and\nyeah I just ran them through cognitive\nServices\num translated them fed them back through\na player\num and when I showed them\nthe subtitles in action like they were\nlike\nwhoa mind blown\nthat's so cool did that lead to uh like\na full I don't know what you call it\nlike deal yeah full like real it's like\na real thing yeah okay so they're out\nusing that now did you were you part of\nthe actual solution sadly no okay\ninteresting so before we move on I have\nquestions about that because the\nconversations with customers\nis do they all pretty much go\nthe same way like or or is it like\nreally like customer by customer like\nthe questions that you have to ask like\neven like are some more formal than\nothers like I just like what what does\nthat look like\nI think like there are some people who\nare really really really good at this\nokay like I'm not gonna say I'm one of\nthem okay but there are some people who\nare really good at just like asking the\nright best questions to get to the real\nroot of the problem\nright like what is what is truly the\nproblem you're trying to solve\num\nand once the problem has been like\nclearly identified\num then the trick\nis to not do what Engineers love to do\nwhich is just to like jump to Solutions\nright right like oh well we could do\nthis we do that we could do this other\nthing like let me let me build this for\nyou like let me run off and do it right\nlike that's that's always what we want\nto do but\njust because you understand the problem\ndoesn't mean that you really understand\nhow they would like to see the solution\nright so though you have solutions that\nyou can think of that would solve this\nproblem you still have to ask more\nquestions to be like\nyou know asking things like\nokay so this uh solution that we build\nlike does it have to integrate with any\nother systems I told you I love\nIntegrations\nI love Integrations so like you just\nhave to like integrate with anything\nelse\num\nlike is there is there like you know any\nconstraints that we should know about\nlike for instance cost yeah right\num and yeah so there there are these\nkinds of things that you need to sort of\nlike you know explore and ask and be\ncurious\num and uh my team calls this the\nenvisioning phase\nso we have like the envisioning phase\nfor engagements which is followed by the\narchitectural design sessions which is\nThen followed by like weeks of uh\nexecution and implementation okay is\nthat it was that how it was handled at\nyour previous role because you had a\ndifferent role now that sounds kind of\nsimilar but it's still different role\nit's pretty much exactly the same okay\nso but what what's what what's the\ndifference like it's a different team\ndifferent org it's so my team was like\num\nspin-off okay of commercial software\nengineering so that's why we have a lot\nof the same sort of practices what my\nteam did was we cherry-picked the good\nand we threw away the bad\nof the role I'm saying of like yeah yeah\nyeah yeah okay so you got the you're a\nlittle bit more niche\nokay I would say yeah do you enjoy it\nmore this way\nyes okay\ninteresting so but your title also\nchanged\nyes okay so that's I guess that's where\nwe come full circle because you are now\nuh\nsenior CSA right CSA Cloud solution\narchitect but\nuse\nare really a software engineer\nwith the solution architect title\nyes okay now this is the interesting\npart is here's what I want to dive more\ninto a little bit more of what like the\nrole looks like do do you feel like do\nyou see that customers\nI want to talk about like the tech part\nof it like do customers come in knowing\nwhat tech they want to use\nusually typically like customers will\ncome in with like they they'll they'll\ncome in with like their um Tech stack\nright like we already use jira we\nalready use GitHub we already use\num GitHub actions for pipelines\num but and where we come in is with okay\nso that's your Tech stack we can work\nwith that now they want to like move\nsome workloads to Azure or develop new\nworkloads in Azure right so um\nwe help them with that part like within\ntheir Tech stack\nso like we don't we don't come in and\nsay sorry you're a Java shop we don't do\nJava okay or sorry like for God's sake\nthe engagement that I'm on soonish is\nusing\num\nlike\nbamboo\npipelines I have not heard of that\nI hadn't heard of it either I thought it\nwas an HR software what is this what is\nthis like I've never seen it or heard of\nit at all\num we're going with it yeah yeah we're\nnot we're not saying no no no no you\nhave to use Azure devops pipelines you\nknow or you have to use terraform or you\nhave to use bicep or you have to use\nthis you have to use that or not we're\nnot prescriptive about that kind of\nthing yeah all like pretty much the only\nrule that we have is\nyou have to be implementing Azure\nworkloads okay like we're not we're not\ngoing to help you like with your AWS or\ngcp stuff AWS or whatever we did have\none um engagement that had a really\ninteresting integration with gcp but we\nwere just we just did the integration\npiece and it was just like a small piece\nso it's not like the entire engagement\nwas like trying to figure out that\nintegration but um uh yeah like that's\npretty much your only role like it has\nto be azure do\nhave you ever come across uh an\nengagement where like your team saw like\noh\nlike a recommendation that\ncustomer didn't want to implement but\nyou thought was\nlike a better option for them\nyes how does that go and they just don't\nwant to do it for whatever reason and\nthen you kind of have to just do what\nthey want\nwe will we will uh it's it's a it's a\nit's a fine line right because you don't\nwant to seem too pushy right because\nlike something we have to be very\ncareful about is um\nyou know we're Engineers we're not\ntrying to come off as sales people yeah\nright so\num if you push too hard on something\nthen people will start to think that\nyou're trying to sell them something and\nwe're not we're not trying to sell them\nsomething see we just we um we have this\nreally cool uh process that we call\num\nI don't even know what ADR stands for to\nbe to be honest but we we write these\ndocuments called I think it's like an\narchitect architectural design record\nokay that's what it is cool\narchitectural design record ADR\num and uh we have like a like a like a\nmarkdown template for these kinds of\num like files but basically uh you know\nif the customer is like I don't know if\nI want to use event hubs or I don't know\nif I want to use Kafka right we would\nwrite an ADR and we would go through the\npros and the cons of each approach\num and the document has a decider we're\nnever the deciders right the customer is\na designer so the customer will review\nthis document and like you know a pull\nrequest right\num because it's code\num\nand they'll they have to read like the\npros and cons they have to review this\ndocument and at the end of it if they\ndecide we don't want to use event hubs\nwe want to use Kafka well\nthat's it that's it I'm gonna go for\nyeah that's it I understand that do you\nhave you ever seen engagement where\nyou just knew they could get better\nperformance or I don't know cost\noptimization from one way but they ended\nup not going that way but you still have\nto implement\nyeah what happens\nyeah for whatever reason people have\ntheir reasons yeah I mean yeah that's\ntrue as well yeah I um\nI'm also super curious about the the\nteam dynamic because\num I guess\ncan you explain a little bit what a\ncustomer what an engagement actually\nlooks like because I have an idea but I\nfeel like people would be interested in\nknowing a little bit more\nyeah sure so they they come to us\num as\num so we're in the customer success unit\num and so we have account teams that are\nworking with customers and\num when they feel like they you know\nhave you know some qualified opportunity\num then at that point they have to like\norchestrate teams to to execute the\nsolution play for that qualified\nopportunity\num and we're one of the teams\nthat gets orchestrated okay um we focus\non a region we are not\num\nyou know we're not too dotted line to an\nindustry okay right so we work with all\ncustomers in Latin America we don't care\nwhat industry you're in for some reason\nwe seem to keep getting FSI customers\nbut that's not on purpose FSI what is\nthat oh Financial Services industry okay\nokay cool yeah\num so uh but we're not we're not we're\nnot like any industry yeah we are any\nany customer in Latin America okay cool\num\nand um so you know the account team will\nwill contact our team and be like hey\nyou know we have this thing it feels\nlike it could be a pretty good Dev Squad\nengagement right and at that point you\nknow my manager and his like manager\npeer will like meet with a customer and\nthey'll start you know some sort of like\nGeneral sense of the problem space like\nthis is like very very high level\nideation right\num and if they're like okay yeah there's\nsomething here right\num then at that point\num they'll put it we have like a board\nthey'll put it on our Board and they'll\nyou know move it across the different\nstages\num and we're our team can run two\nparallel engagements at once okay so we\ndon't scale very well yeah\nscaling is not our Forte so\num you know based on like where we are\nyou know sometimes we we lose some of\nthese engagements because they just\ncan't wait for us right\num but if a customer can wait for us and\nthen when it gets to us you know we have\nsome sense of like the general problem\nspace and then we'll have you know a\nweek-long envisioning where you know I\nsort of already talked about that\num we try to really drill into like what\nis the problem\nand what do you want your solution to\nlook like like what\nproblems does it have to solve what\nconstraints are we dealing with\num and then we move on to the\narchitectural design session another\nweek\num where that's when we actually start\nlike drawing architecture\num and you know\njust figuring out the entire landscape\nof what it is that we're going to be\nimplementing and then after that we have\nsix weeks of\nexecution\num and we do one-week Sprints which it\ntook me a long time to get on board with\nthis to be honest\nbut yeah one week\num\nit feels\nlike a Mad Dash I can imagine the whole\ntime the whole time yeah you're just you\njust feel like you're like literally\nlike like the crazed person seeing the\ntrain coming and like laying the tracks\ndown\nbut there's like the speeding locomotive\ncoming and you're just like I have to\nfill this train uh train track\num so yeah it's uh it's it's pretty\nintense uh but yeah for those six weeks\nwe do one week Sprints um we we do\nweekly demos\num we are working towards that sort of\nfinished\num architecture that we drew the second\nweek\num and of course like the architecture\nchanges as the engagement goes on\nbecause you have to make\num adjustments as you go but like\ngenerally speaking that's like what we\nare aiming for yeah but at what point is\nthere like uh\nI'm assuming I have to sign some sort of\nagreement or a contract or for this\nengagement to happen or what does that\nlook like\n[Laughter]\nit's just something that you don't worry\nabout you just do you just build the\nstuff out pretty much at some point\nsomeone's probably signed something\nillegal's been involved but I don't know\nhow that works but that's yeah that's\ncool because that's the part that\nworries me about the like social Arctic\nWorld in general is I don't really want\nto have to get bogged down with oh we\ngot to get you to sign this we got to\nget you to get hit this number or\nsomething like that yeah yeah the good\nthing for my team is that we don't have\nto worry about like quotas yeah right I\ndon't have to hit some number of you\nknow consumed Revenue\nI don't have any Targets like that\num and so again\num you know I feel like I helped confuse\nyou about solution architect roles\nabsolutely I'm still confused\nand the the honest thing is that like\nthough my title is solution architect\nI'm I don't act like one yeah so it's I\nonly have this title because I'm in the\nCSU and there's no other title they\ncould really give us yeah and that's for\nwhat we do but that's more like a like a\npaperwork kind of issue than actually\nlike what you do it's not like yours you\ncall the Social architect because that's\nwhat you're doing\nyeah yeah they'd probably have to like\ndo some sort of policy change to change\nyour the team's title yeah and I I did I\ndid worry about that a lot when\num I was looking at this particular role\num I was also looking at another role\nwithin Microsoft which would have given\nme an engineering title\num and I would have been\num\nlike in Scott Guthrie's organization\nokay so that feels like oh yeah\nlike aligned right I'm an engineer\nyou're in I'm doing engineering work my\ntitle is engineering like all all lined\nup\num\nironically that role was very little\nHands-On keyboard coding yeah see this\nis the thing but I think\nTech in general is like roles are just\nall over the place\nyeah there's like no you like when you\ntarget something it's like you can't\njust say I'm preparing for this role and\nit's going to be universally applied\nlike no it really is it can be like\ncompany and in our case team to team\nor or to order no I guess to the team\nmight be a good description yeah yeah I\nmean there there are csas in Latin\nAmerica for sure that would look at me\nand look at what I do for my job and be\nlike wow that's not what I do yeah it's\nlike it's not a CSA yeah fascinating I\nwell we've been chatting for a while now\nand I'll keep you on too too much longer\nI really appreciate the the conversation\nI wanted to see if there's anything that\nI feel like we covered like a lot here\num\nand someone asked like oh if we wanted\nto roll simmer to what you do like what\nto look for at Microsoft but again I\nthink it's just\njust read the descriptions because\nI couldn't tell you I mean I'm a\nsoftware engineer but like you mentioned\nlike there might be some engineering\ngigs that\ndon't Implement as much or aren't as\nHands-On as like your role as a CSA\nuh oh here's a fun question\nhow important is Bash\nfor for your role\nextremely okay interesting script like I\nguess we could say scripting if we want\nto make it as like General as possible\nbut it's something extremely you use\nevery single engagement\nyes okay every day every day ah see this\nis everything I love to hear\nhave you every day in that has that only\nbeen at Microsoft did you use it\npreviously\nit's only a Microsoft and um because\nlike you know previous to working at\nMicrosoft I was always on Windows and\nyou know I had to do some like\nPowershell stuff but like you know I\ndidn't I I had a vague understanding of\nwhat bash was like but very very very\nvague yeah and only in the like God I\nhope I never have to do that\ndo you like it\nI do okay I do but um when I started\nworking at Microsoft and um\nyou know I mean so much of what we do\nis like running on Linux yeah if you\nwant to avoid Linux and work at\nMicrosoft\nlike there are very few jobs you can\nactually do yeah I mean in an\nengineering sense right yeah I mean I\nsaw a stat recently and this was from\n2020 so it's definitely more than that\nlike of customers who have workloads in\nAzure more than 50 of those like when it\ncomes to compute obviously are running\non Linux\nso you know and that's that's that's got\nto be higher now so you can't really\nEscape it do you off the top of your\nhead like what are some things that you\nuse bash for\nwell I run Windows\num and I use WSL\num and\nlike\nwindows I use for Outlook teams\nand Internet Explorer okay and one note\nokay one note\nthat's it I do love OneNote\num all of my other work happens in WSL\nokay so you're like all of my\ndevelopment happens in WSL\num like all like pretty much all my work\nhappens over there so like you know gosh\nI mean as soon as I open it like I have\nto like you know even code dot yeah or\neven just move them around yeah yeah\nyeah yeah okay so I'm assuming yeah\npretty comfortable working with like\ndifferent clis and like stuff like that\nin general yeah I mean like you know we\nuse terraform a lot\nokay okay I guess I should ask you like\nwhat is like the absolute basic skill\nset that someone who wanted to go and\ncome into a role or get into a role like\nyours need\nI would say like for my team\num\nlike really all you need is the hunger\nto learn\nand this is like a dream\nopen-mindedness to tackle anything yeah\nright so like I think that\nwhen new people join our team and we've\nhad a number of new people start on our\nteam since I've been on which like uh\nalmost two years now and um\nI've I found that you can\nsplit people into two groups\npeople who just immediately jump into\nthe pool okay\nand people who stand by the side of the\npool and stare at it for a long time\nand I only want to work with the people\nwho jump into the pool okay\nso like that's what I'm looking for I'm\nnot looking for someone who knows python\nJava bash like Azure workloads I want\nsomeone who will just jump into the pool\nokay like that's that's that's the\nquality that I would look for like in\nanyone that I work with someone who's\njust like you know like the the last\nengagement that I worked on we had to\nuse API management\num and uh it was such a big part of this\nengagement we had a whole work stream\naround API management and I led to that\nwork stream prior to this engagement I\nhad never even known what it was\nyou have I didn't even know it was a\nthing\nwith engagements there's there's time\nfactored into to upskill I mean you only\nhave six weeks so what does that look\nlike it's like literally that's what I\nsaid you're like crazy you feel like a\ncrazy person laying down the tracks for\na steaming locomotive coming straight\nfor you that's what it's like you just\nbut the cool thing is so like our team\nhas this model that we call code with so\nwe are coding with our customers like\nhand in hand\num they bring their own like business\nand domain knowledge and we bring the\nAzure knowledge and we work together\nright okay so after we engage they can\njust take over where we left off there's\nno there's no maintenance tale for us\nright so that's the whole idea yeah but\nthe cool thing about uh you know when\nwe're like\nokay you're going to be using you know\nthese workloads we're not like though we\nare uh you know the Microsoft experts\num you know we we can be really open and\ntransparent about like our own like\nlack of knowledge about them and we can\njust say let's learn together\nand so they can they get the experience\nof like learning hand in hand and coding\nhand in hand\num and that and knowing that it's all\nokay\nright so it's like it's okay to not know\nit's part of the the role to an extent\nyeah like just embrace it between\nengagements is there is there down timethere has to be yeah because these\nengagements are so intense\nokay I I feel like when I'm in the\nexecution phase of an engagement I'm\njust sitting here at my desk sweating\nnon-stop for six straight weeks\nthat's what it feels like I'm literally\nlike sweating\nfor six weeks\nit's just it feels like that much like\nstress and pressure\nbut it's also fun like I don't wanna\nI don't want to make it sound like that\nit is fun I feel like yeah\nI mean I can tell you enjoy it\ndefinitely just tell that you you thrive\nlike that's the thing you wanted to do\ndo you is this like\nthe type of stuff you want to keep doing\nwith your career long term\nyeah I mean the cool thing about\nthe dev Squad is um like I was I was\ntalking to someone\num who is relatively new\num to Microsoft and like is a recent\ngrad\num and they're already kind of feeling\nbored with their job interesting and\nI was like\nI mean I know how that feels\nand that's not good yeah but the cool\nthing about my job is that it literally\ncan never really be that boring are all\nthe do you see any similarities across\nengagements or is it really everything\njust completely different\nI mean\none thing that seems to repeat\nconstantly is kubernetes oh my God okay\nmaybe that's something so much\nkubernetes\nevery time we're doing like an\nenvisioning and I'm like oh my God there\nit is again\nthat icon\nI remember you commented on on something\nlike when no one knows kubernetes\nthey're lying yeah\nthat's true okay maybe that's something\nfor people to look out\non on if they are interested do you feel\nlike your role\nis entry-level friendly I don't think so\nbut I would like to hear your opinion\nI think it is you do okay what do we\nconsider entry level like someone who\nspends six months learning the skills no\nTech experience\nyeah I mean like I said the quality I am\nlooking for is someone who is\nopen-minded and willing to learn this is\nwhat I this is what I cannot stand\nI cannot stand it when someone is like\noh I'm an expert in XYZ therefore I\ncannot do ABC okay okay good to know\nthat kind of like I mean like at\nMicrosoft we talk about this all the\ntime the whole like growth mindset thing\nright so someone who is just like this\nis what I do I don't do that they have a\nvery fixed mindset right they're\nunwilling to\nmake a leap or do something different or\nwhatever\num and so for me I just want someone who\nis willing to take a risk yeah okay just\ntry just try it sounds like people might\nhave more of a more of a problem\nactually Landing the interview then\nfiguring out the role because if they do\nget into the role it sounds like they're\npretty much set up for success as long\nas they have the right mindset\nand I guess yeah I mean our team\nyeah our team is like I've talked to you\nabout our team like we are all like\nvery supportive\nyou know experience can vary right\nacross our team like some people have\nmore some people have less it doesn't\nseem to matter we all just support each\nother so like you know if I can see that\nyou know you're trying\nand you're learning and like you need\nhelp like help will be there okay it's\ngood to know it's good to know all right\nI want to wrap it up there I think we\ncan generalize the advices of you know\ngo for it just apply as cliche as it\nsounds I mean you just applied I mean\nyou got it you got it you got it I I\nstill have no idea why they hired meI love it I I appreciate you taking it I\ntook so much of your time but I could\ntalk to you for hours about this such\ninteresting stuff\num I'm sure we're gonna get I can come\nback no I I was about to say people are\ngonna have more questions I feel like\nthey're really gonna appreciate this\nconversation and maybe you'll be like a\nrecurring friend of the channel or\nsomething like that uh but thank you\nand everyone leave your questions in the\ncomments and then we'll see if we get\nanother another one of these out\nand uh peace out",
