badhow we doinguh mic check two two oneBennett\nChristopher what's going ontime to do a little workso this is what I got going on here\nwhat up JPum\nhere we go so\nyou all are probably familiar with the\ncloud Rosemary challenge here's mine\nand then the counter's not working so\nwe're getting an error not name not\nresolved\nI also want to add a project section\nhere\nso\nlet's see what we can dolook at that JP and\nChristopher in Brazil that's awesomeall rightlet's take a look here one second y'allI don't even think I have this code on\nthis machine like I haven't worked on\nthis project in a whileuh resume Azure is no easy dude\nno I don't think I have thisit's time to go to GitHubuh\nshare with my stories I don't even\nremember resume let me see it's one of\nthese\nI don't know if it's this one or this\noneresume it's yeah it's probably this one\nit's a refactor\nto.net.net sixyeah I should be this one all right so\nlet's get this code hereI get clonealso what we can do is do like a z\ngroup listuh not let's do AZ group list\noutput table\nand\nstrg\nit's not in this subscription\nlet's do AZ account setI don't know hold onI have to find the right subscription\nbecause I don't think I'm working on\nthat one\nwhen I joined Microsoft they gave us\nlike monthly credits\num so there's like a certain amount of\ncredits that you can use every month for\nlike your own things to learn and\nwhatnot\num and I remember that that subscription\nwas a different one than the exist like\nI had to create a new subscription or\nsomething like that\nso now I gotta go find what the name of\nthat isuh it's called it's called Microsoft\nAzure okayall right so easy account set dash dash\nsubscription\nand then we'll do that\nso if I do a z group lists output table\nCloud resume challenge here we go all\nright so AZ function app\num\nfunction app list\nand the resource Group actually G\nCloud resumeit's made challengeokay so there's no function in there\nthat's probably what's going onum\nall right so I have the code and I think\nI just have to getI think I just have to provision\nthe CI CD to a new function appso let's take a look hereCD Azure resumeum\nlet's open this up in codeI'm looking forward to that video from\nearlier I haven't gotten a chance to\nwatch it yeah yeah\nthe developer CLI is awesome\nI\nwant to package\nthis project this resume into that oneumso it'll be a lot easier so people can\njust do like ACD\nup dashes template and then use like\nthis template and then they'll have like\na full implementation in their cloud\nuh hold on let me answer some work stuffif you all are on Twitter did you all\nsee that that boot camp boot camp\nscandalhey GPS how much do you spend monthly to\nmaintain your projects online I'm an\nabsolute beginner following your video\nabout how to be a cloud engineer\num so for example this this resume\nproject runs for like less than a dollar\na month\num\nI probably I'm looking to run the the\ncloud dictionary too that's probably\ngoing to be some like 10.\n20 a month\nwith like moderate amount of traffic\num\nyeah but I don't really so the\ndifference is I don't run\nstuff too much\nlike I'll deploy them and then once it's\ndone like for whatever use case or what\ndemo or whatever it is I'm using\nthen I'll tear it down and then I'll\nhave just infrastructure that's code so\nI can bring it back up wheneverokay back in region done at six we're\nusing Windows function app\num so that's why I don't really spend a\nlot monthlybut the goal is to make the cloud\ndictionary project to be one that runs\nevery month to have like a real product\nin production\nand like my hero project uh so yeah\nlet's see done at six so we just need a\nWindows function app\nI'm going to use a portal for thatuh\ngo uhresource groups I have this open another\none another one uh just because I don't\nwant to switch this\nyeah create\nfunction appfunction app create\nuh I would highly recommend\nserverless projects\nuh let me see if I can get the same name\nhere\nback in six what's the name of thisget visitor counter so we're going to\ncall it the same thing get visitor\ncounter\nuh\nruntimestack.net.net six ISO\nis this isolated yes this this is\nisolated right hold on is this isolated\nuh I mean if I did it it's probably\nisolated\nlet's take a look here back and API six\nto get counter yeah this is isolated\nokay cool\nEast us2 Windows consumption\nall rightmtbf yeah that mtbf\nboot camp\nlike I just keep reading more and more\ntweets about it and I just I'm just like\nso surprised of how much fraud and scam\nwent into that boot camp it's crazyum that the book The this is I'll put\nthis in chat\nhere\nuh so this is the cloud resume challenge\nbut if you're looking for the serverless\nresume API\num that's I'll give you this one too\nserious resume API\nthis one I and this one is cool because\nthe resume API is built in a way that\nyou just follow the steps and you'll\nhave it deployed whereas a cloud resume\nis more so just an implementation that\nisn't documented in that way and this is\nalso using Code spaces so you don't even\nneed to download anything locally I've\nprovided a\num a Dev container configuration with\neverything that you'll need so it\ninstalls and then restores everything\nfor you\nso I think this is actually a pretty\ngood project for like if you want to\nspend a couple of hours on a weekend or\nsomething like that getting some\nHands-On stuff\nso do check that out\nuh all right so what was I doing I was\ncreating a functionso what's going on here is I erased that\nthe subscription where the function for\nmy counter because here it's supposed to\nhave like a counter uh\nI erased it on purpose\num like the the descript the\nsubscription is disabled or it got\ndisabled on purpose\nso now what I'm going to do is just\ndeploy a new function to a subscription\nthat is enabled\num and this is better too because I was\nbefore I had multiple resource groups so\nnow I'm just going to have one Resource\nGroup\num\nwhich I think is better\nit's a little more organizeduh hold onokay so let me see here deployment is in\nprogress looks good\nall right let's give that a secondeasy night wait hold on taking my easy\n900 this week that's awesome\nthat's a great first step\nI constantly tell people that the 900 is\nnot like some people try to undervalue\nit but I remember taking that one and\nbarely passing and that was with like\ntwo years of azure experience so so\ngreat it gives you like I was talking\nwith Lucy about this when we were\nstreaming the other day but more than\nanything it just introduces you to\nlearning cloud and how to study for\ncertifications how to take\ncertifications and I think that is a\nvaluable skill set on its own\nwhat up Jay\nwhat's going on everyone all right so\nI've deployed my\nI've deployed my function app\ncool so now if I run that same command\nthat I did before which is this\nThis Cloud this thing you see I get a\nresult here I can probably even do\nsomething like\nhold on there's so much information I\ndon't need all this information I just\nneed the name of itwhat is the name of this thing let's see\napp service plan do do enable host host\ntype\nit's probably just name right oh yeah\nyeah okay so then if we did something\nlike\nquery Dash Dash\nquerythen we'll do do do name\nname\nclose this close this\nwe're gonna get that visitor counter\nhere\nclear I'll do that but one more I'm\ntelling you y'all so understanding James\npath\nso like the reason that this query here\nworks\nthis this works like what to put in this\ndouble quotes once I understood how to\nactually do that it's such a better and\nmore efficient experience using a CLI\nwhen you can actually filter through\nwhat you're looking for\nand then you could probably do something\nlike\nI'll put tsv\nand then assign that to our variable\nwhich I'm going to do so I'm going to do\nfont actually can I\nhow do I assign variables here I don't\nthink I can do that\ncan I do because I'm not in bash\ntechnically I don't know if this will\nwork yeah I don't know how to do it in\nthe windows one\nI'll probably have to do it in like WSL\nlet's do this hereuh what framework did you use for the\nfront end application\nI don't remember let me see\nfront end is probablyoh it's just HTML\nHTML is good old HTML and CSS that's it\nand some JavaScript that's itset oh you can do set okay sweet let's\ndo that then let's do set\nfunction\noh sweet how do I print this out though\nit's not Echo right\nokay can we do\nis it like dollar sign function\nno oh my goodness hold on\nhow do I Echo\nfunction is it like that no how do I\nEcho itwhat up Garcia Echo function that's not\nworking in I'm in Windows terminal\nI I I need to be in Bash that's my\nproblem\nhold on AZ account\nset subscriptionit's called like\nwhat's it called it's called like\nMicrosoft Azure subscription\nso oh goodness hold on setokay clear so now if I do\nthe same commands that I was trying to\ndo here\nuh this year\nI can do this here\nbut I want to do\nuh function equals and then put this all\ninside of\num\nand I do Echo\nfunction\noh no I did this wrong hold on I just\nwant it to d uh\n[Music]\nI think I have to do this\nhow does it just return\nlike thatthere we go perfect\nlook at my bash skills I'm getting\nbetter at this\nokay so nowlet me take a look here my workflow my\nback end I got that good visitor counter\ncheck out Azure credentials your secrets\ncredentials work sign and version find\nunder version five Azure function\npackage path that's fine\nAzure function app name Azure function\napp name is fine Azure function package\npath Azure functions\nI probably need to update the publish\nprofile so go herea secret actions\nto do credentials is probably fine I\nneed this\nso let's get that\num I have I actually have that here I\nhave the command that I need to use\nuh this one here\nall right we're gonna paste that in\nthere and I just need to change\nthe resource Group is cloud resumechallenge Dash Resource Group\nuh and then the function name is\nwhatever I saved in the function\nvariableah what did I do wrong hereCloud resume oh my easy group list\nwhat is the name here\noh it has dashes in it okay\ncloudresume\nchallenge like that\nokay cool that works and I copy this\nhere\nand then I go to my actionsupdate that secret\nmy security key\nthis is what I use\nfor\nauthenticating so much easier I mean so\nmuch better than MFA I mean like\nauthenticator appsit would be nice if you review our Cloud\nresumes and give us some tips send them\nsend them\nlearn to Cloud guide gmail.com send them\nand I'll review themokay cool\nsoI actually don't think I'm I didn't make\nany changes here did I I think I'm cool\nwith everything that's here\nprobably what I'll need to change\neventually is\nthe app settingsokay let's go into actions\ndeploy backend.net6uh uh we'll just we'll can I run this\nfrom here no can I where can I run this\nfrom\noh no there's no like on workflow okay\nwe're gonna have to go tohere actually nolet's go here code workflow backend six\nand then I'm just gonna add\nonworkflow what is it workflow dispatch\nthis patchoh no this goes up hereI think that's the right one that might\nnot be the right one I know I configured\nsomething similar to this up herecode good for close Builds on we'll\nfollow this patch okay I'm just missing\nthis year\nstart commit commit okay\n[Applause]\nlet's see if this worksuh done at six now we can do a run\nworkflow see so adding that workflow\nunderscore dispatch to the on which will\nallow you to have this run workflow here\nso let's see if it actually worksthe code should work\nthough the code probably needs to be\nrefactored like if I'm looking at this\nlike I'm pretty sure I could make it\nlike clean it because my.net skills are\ndefinitely significantly better now\nso we'll take a look\nso if you are sending me your resumes\nmake sure to remove any data\nthat you don't want me to publicly show\nlike you don't want to dock yourself\nremember that soall rightso it's running let's see if this runs\nsuccessfully I don't think I've ever ran\na GitHub workflow GitHub actions\nworkflow successfully on first tryso how's everyone doing let me see Echo\nprobably I got so I got tired of trying\nto figure out the windows terminal\nproper command to print out a variable I\njust went I just switched into WSL\nW cell is\nfreaking awesome I love it I love it\nuh also good news good news I finished\nmy rough draft on my outline for my\nLinux bash course\nright now it's looking to be around 25\nvideos and I ran it by my potential\nco-host so we're going back and forth to\nkind of like Define it it's so hard to\npick what should be\nwhat should be in like a beginner\ncurriculum\num\nbut that's kind of where we're at at the\nmoment\nbut that's going wellall right let's take a lookjust a random question what is your\ninternet upload speed I don't know let\nme take a look I'll do I'll run a speed\ntest railuh\nwell it's going\nW still stopped me from buying a Mac I\nhave a Mac\nI have an M1 Pro\nthat I just feel so bad that I bought\nbecause I don't use it because just\nWindows is perfect for everything\nI think I'm gonna sell it\numI don't know\nyeah it's just like sitting there it's I\njust feel like it feels like and I hate\nwasting money so\nit's kind of like one of those purchases\nthat pisses me off that I made\numwhat up udx uh my bad Echo oh you need\nthe percentage signs you're right you're\nright that's how you do itmy download is 142 my upload is 0.09I don't know if that's good or bad but\nthat's what I gotuh so let's see if this works I like\ndoing these one-off Cloud projects with\ny'all\num\nthat's cool because I don't really know\nif it's gonna work but we're gonna debug\nit live all of us together\nuh we're running the functions action\nI wonder if this needs to be updated\nwe'll seelet's take a look look so another\nImprovement I want to do with this\nworkflow is right now it's deploying to\na Windows Azure function I want to\ndeploy it to a Linux\nfunctionbut I can I can do that pretty\nstraightforward I don't know if I'll do\nthat today but I do want to do it\nmaybe your streaming's eating that\nupload by the way 0.09 my voice is Tiny\nprobably\nbut hey it's working\nyeah\numwhat laptop are you using for day to day\nI have a custom PC\nI have a um\nI have a 2060 card AMD ryzen 5 32 gigs\nof RAM two terabytes of storage\nuh I've got like a water cooler those\nkinds of things\num\nI just think for the amount of money oh\nmy goodness it worked I just think for\nthe amount of money uh it makes more\nsense for me to\nput it into a custom PC because I don't\nmove around a lot for work I have a\nthink pad I have a p14 that thing is a\nbeast so that's the laptop that I use\nwhen I go to the office I'm actually\ngoing to go to the office tomorrow do\nyou all want an office tour video\nbut I'm gonna be there tomorrow so I'm\ngoing to take my laptop with me but when\nI'm like here here I have like multiple\ndisplay got a custom PC over here\num\nI'll probably do like a new setup Tour\non my Vlog Channel\num so yeah all right uh it looks like it\nworks let me look at this here\nhereuh overview refresh\nso something came in there's some\nactivity hereuh let me show you all this\nso there's some activity here so if I go\ntoleft side functions we should see it\nhere here we go get visitor counter\nbut this probably doesn't workbecauseit doesn't have\nuh\nuh the configuration\nso this probably needs\naccess the cosmos DB it probably also\nneeds access toum let's take a look\nso let's go back into our good old codeTor would be cool yeah\num I'll do I'll do I'll record maybe I\ndon't know no promises\nAPI net six uh let's look at our\nokay uh give us their counter and let's\nsee which ones are they referencing\nso we need a connection string cool so\nlet me add that\nwhere did my\nI'm going to add them in here\nI'm going to move this over herewhat up doorsuh okay\nlike thisuh application and then I need to go\nfind my Cosmos DBconnection string\nanyone have experience with Cosmos DB\nso I've used both the SQL API and then\nthe mongodb onethere's pros and cons to both of them uh\nI think I like working more with the SQL\nAPI specific to Cosmos DB because it's\nsort of like a native experience the\ncosmos DBA API I find that it lacks from\nlike the actual like up-to-date Cosmos\nDB\nuh where are my keys here copy this here\nokay and then I also need\nokay that connection string that's fine\nuh I wonder if we need storage I don't\nthink we need storage\nlet's see go back in here counter\nI don't think this is referencing\nanything collection name because we're\nwe're hard coding in which I shouldn't\ndo but for now that's fineum\nanyone else here in Seattle area\nsometimes I wish I lived in Seattle\nbecause I would have access to so many\njust Microsoft people like to just work\nwith in person I think that'd be so cool\nbut I don't really like\nSeattle weather or\nthe area in general\nuh okay so now if I goall right it works people so now I have\nthis hereum that looks like C sharp this is C\nSharp I am a C sharp developer you are\ncorrect\nso if I refresh thislet's see if it works oh hold on I think\nI might\nneed to enablecourse some more tools developer tools\nyep I knew it so I need to go here here\nuh hold on here\nif we search for if we search for course\noh it's right here\nI need to add it from\nthis pagehere here submitoh wait wait wrong one wrong\nthat's the wrong one we need to go to\nthe function\ngo to Resource course search it hereuh uh where where to gowhy is it not showing at me oh here it\nis\nboom\nthere\nsave okayuh I agree wait wait what is it are your\nchats live typically available on your\nchannel after you finish them yeah\nthe the live the full lives are\navailable\npublicly but then I get I get um\nI have my editor do like summarized\nversions that but those are available\nonly to members but the full thing the\nall the content\num is available publicly after Okay cool\nso now if I do let me put this over here\nif I refresh this here let's take a look\nuh\nwebsite called oh here we go it works\nhuh\nso a couple of things I want to add I\nwant to add a projects section here\nand then just showcase like two or three\nprojects perhaps\nbut I'm not gonna do that now at least I\nknow that this works so that's coolthat's a little a little Cloud\n[Music]\num\na little Cloud action for today\nso yeah people I'm gonna send this over\nfor y'all if you want to build your own\nhighly recommend it and then I also\nrecommend you do this one the serverless\nresume APIum\nboom\nuh probably start with this one because\nit's like a smaller scope\nuh the serverless system my API has a\nsmaller scope but you're getting\nHands-On with similar services\nbut this one I also built it in a way\nthat you can follow it as a workshop\num\nand like you have like you're using a\nbunch of commands and all those good\nthings here all right so let's now\nswitch intofull screenuhlet's seeokay coolwhat happened let me close this let me\nclose this\nI hear my girlfriend talking really loud\non the phone in the background it's kind\nof distracting\nuhuh okay coolall right let's answer some questions\npeople\nwhat do we got what do we got did\neveryone see the boot camp fraud scam\ngoing up on Twitter do you use it did\nyou use a template\num\nwait hold on\noh my they're doing another mtvf space\nright now I don't like I can't be in\nTwitter spaces for more than like\n20 minutes because then it took us too\nchaotic for me and I'm like I gotta\nbounce\nanyway did you take your resume style\nidea from some website uh I believe I\ndid I believe it's a template that I\nmentioned somewhere\num like in the instructions oh at the\nbottom it says template by CV\nuh and then that links to the template\nthere so if you go to the footer of my\npage you'll find it there\nuh let me go back here yep yes I use the\ntemplate yes yes I did because I have no\nskills when it comes to CSS or design in\ngeneral so\nlet's see how do people learn what\nconstant changes and updates so for me\nI'm kind of like in the flow I'm in the\nflow already of just always doing\nsomething in Azure so it's easy for me\nto kind of like be like okay today I'm\nlearning this service the next week I'm\nlike doing this but it's all like very\nrelated\nlike I will like and I can always\nlike so like for example functions Azure\nfunctions is a service that has several\nIntegrations with other Azure services\nso\nit was it kind of easier it makes it\neasier for me to learn other Azure\nservices in relation to functions\num so it makes it easier to pick up\nsomething new\nso I'm kind of kind of just in that flow\nof like every all the time just working\non something\nbut it's definitely like a it's like\nyou've got to take it easy you gotta\nlike become comfortable with thatlast night they kept muting folks\ntalking over each otherthat that that boot camp scam is like\njust crazy I mean I stand by\nmy opinion of I just don't recommend\nboot camps in general\nunless I have\ndone them firsthanduh what did I miss hereI just started studying for my aac900 on\nCBT really excited that's awesomeI just found the ACG video for build my\nresume is that a first group Club\nproject I have in ACG sub yeah it's a\ngood first Cloud project\num I'm the host of that one the Azure\nresume one when I worked at umwhen I worked at a cloud Guru I did the\nthe Azure version there's some updates\nobviously because that was like you know\nover\ntwo over a year and a half ago\nbut if you keep if you look at my GitHub\nrepo all the codes up to date so that\nwould be good\nhey I discovered your YouTube channel\nlike a week ago how I became an itvid\nthank you a lot for your work I've\nalready learned a lot it's awesome\nby any chance you have a video on your\nOS setup no that is like a good I got\nI've gotten that request too\nlike my kind of like developer setup uh\nthe tools and things that I use\nso I could potentially do that I mean\nI'm just like I'm a big\nWSL so via's code okay let's do\nWSL vs code\num I guess okay Ubuntu and WSL vs code\nAzure CLI\nand then and Asher that's kind of like\nmy stack\num\nI use a thunder client inside of vs code\na lot for like API calls\nif I need more features I use insomnia\nbut thunderclient tends to do like the\nmajority of the workyeah I've been playing around with using\ndef containers a lot more too\nso I'm not installing stuff locally\nyeah\nUbuntu is great\nuh\nuh what is the name of the boot camp\nthat did the scam it's called like\nMB MB something and be something my tech\nbest friend mtbf there we go\nmy tech best frienduh yeah I got tired of this college name\nhere boot camps on Twitter ad so I wrote\na post to drive them shared it on the\nMTV after\noh I gotta check that out\nUbuntu is great it is great\nwhy does Ubuntu why does everyone like\nUbuntu because of its compatibility\nI feel like a super user user friendly\nand I think as like a first distro\nand actually not just first distro I\nthink just as like if you wanted it to\nbe your day-to-day your daily driver\nit's a great distro for that\num there's like a lot of documentation a\nlot of just Community around it too\npersonally like my top tier like my\nabsolute favorite is pop OS but I don't\nthink there's a pop OS option for WSLwhy does every oh hold on\nI can't leave the light oh yeah hello\nare you afraid of recession layoffs will\nstart hitting Cloud devops jobs they\nalready have like Microsoft like my\nemployer laid off like 2 000 people in\nAugust 1 000 people recently I'm pretty\nsure more are coming\num every day I kind of feel like oh\ntoday I might get an email and I might\nnot have a job anymore\num but you know I as you can see from my\nfinanced videos like how I spend my\nsalary in those kind of videos I'm\npretty smart with saving so if something\ndid happen\num I would have a backup plan for a\ncouple of months\nwhat's up yeahsuper great compatibility how do you\nlike hold on hold on hold on how do you\nlike the.net ecosystem\nso funny story with net I first was sort\nof obligated to learn it when I was\nworking as a CIS admin because it was a\nsmall company and they needed some help\non\nI think it was like an MVC project and I\ndidn't\nwant to I don't know because I I had\ndone some like research on like C\nsharpen.net and then\num I think I just saw a lot of\nlike people saying it's Legacy is old\ndon't learn it you're not going to get\nanywhere\nbut and then I was like oh can I I want\nto do like python like Python's the\ncoolest thing like I wanted to do it\nbut\nthen I kind of sat down and I thought to\nmyself like oh well if you're don't want\nto do.net you're not going to get this\nproject and you're not going to get the\nexperience\nso I ended up obviously learning doing\nthere but it wasn't like my first choice\nit was sort of\nlike an opportunity brought on to me\nso\nyeah and ever since then it's just like\nthe tool that I've been leaning into\nmore and more mainly because it's like I\nalready have experience with it and if I\nhave the option to pick a language I\nalready know\nand then I can spend time upskilling in\nother services instead of having to\nworry about the programming language and\nthat's what I'm going to do\nI'm not in a field where like the\nspecific language or like the\nperformance or the optimization or\nanything like that matters\num so yeah\nbut if I didn't know if I wasn't leaning\nmore into.net I would probably want to\nbecome a rust developer\nsuper a great compatibility in the best\nregion fruit boot into it yeah it just\nworks it works fantastic\nlike it just and that's what you want\nwith an operating system\nhow often is degree required for it I'm\nI'm with a company at 19 as an\napprentice\nI mean it can become a hurdle but\nyou can get into it with that oneuh\nuh what made you choose Azure over AWS\nbecause the place that I was working at\nso I studied for AWS first so I spent\nsix months studying for also I spent six\nmonths which is unheard of nobody these\ndays spends six months studying for\ncertifications\nbut I spent six months studying for my\nAWS certified developer associate\nand then I landed a job at an Azure shop\nand they were like you can get as much\nCloud as experience as you want but you\ngot to learn Azure you got to do it\nAzure I was like all right cool so then\nagain it's the same thing I had momentum\nand I was able to lean more into Azure\nas I continued like moving in up and up\nin my career so yeah that's why\nuh let's see herewhy doesn't the language and performance\nmatter in your space because\nI do a lot of\numhow do I explain it like I do a lot of\ndemos\num or like or events or product work\nwhere the language is already kind of\nselected so I'm not like a technical\nlead or a solution architect defining\nanything\nso I kind of just come in and tag in or\non projects.net is already what's being\nused\num\nand they have selected.net for whatever\nreason is so I mean the re so I probably\nshould reward that\nI'm not in like you know when you're\nbuilding like command lines or you're\nbuilding like underlying infrastructure\nor you're building like I don't know\nthese tools that are meant to or\nprojects apps whatever that are meant to\nbe super lightweight like like rust as a\nlanguage comes to mind that's used a lot\nfor that type of work\nthen you would probably have to go with\na different language\n[Music]\num\nso that's why I say it doesn't matter\nfor meuh\nuh so so about the school thingif you have the opportunity to go to\nschool and you can afford it and you\nfeel like that way of learning is the\nbest for you go for it absolutely\nbut if you have the slight hesitation\nyou're like I don't feel like this is\nfor me then just know there are other\noptions for you to learn okay you don't\nhave to absolutely go to school\nthere are benefits from going to school\nlike networking and obviously having a\ndegree does still have some value\nbut you can definitely get into it\nwithout ityou learn a cloud inspired me to host my\nowntrue Nas on KVM\nhype Liberty hypervisor hosted on my\nUbuntu Server current to play next Cloud\non true Nas then offside backside on\nblob storage that's awesome that's a\nsick project right there\nAnyway by some blog posting completely\nnew but I know I know I will regret not\nblogging or documenting on my cloud home\nlab projects just been knocking them out\nto be honest\nthat is sick so I I would say if you\nalready have any projects that are like\nyou're done with\num take take a take a second to like\nreverse engineer it in like blog or use\nvideos\num and kind of just speak to\nhow you put it together any challenges\nyou encountered any things you would do\ndifferently any things you want to\nimprove\num for further projects like I think it\nwould be really sick if you had like the\napproach of oh like this I'm building\nthis and this week I did this Pro\nprogress next week you know it's kind of\nlike as you go I think that would be\nsuper sickuh but like don't feel like one blog\npost needs to cover absolutely\neverything like it can be as specific or\nas general as you need it to be\num but definitely if you set out to\ncreate blog posts I would say if it's a\nseries try to complete it\num\nyeah\nand just don't have like these massive\ngoals for each post I would say that toouh wait where are we this is so awesome\nI was literally just trying to do this\nchallenge a couple of weeks ago yeah so\nonce this live is done you can go back\nto the beginning of of the recording and\nsee what I fixed what essentially what\nhad was broken was I deleted my phone no\nmy subscription got disabled that my\nfunction lived into it but I had been\nmeaning to move that function into the\nnew Resource Group where all the other\nresources for the challenge live so\ntoday what I did was just create a new\nfunction and then make sure the GitHub\nthe GitHub actions workflow was\ndeploying to the correct one\nI want to do another stream where I'm\nworking through the code and making\nimprovements because I've learned a lot\nmore.net and functions since I\noriginally created thisyeah sowe're using azda on your Cloud resume\nnot no not yet\num that was actually something that I\nmentioned that I want to put this all\ninto\neasy D all I really would have to do is\nDefine the infrastructure as code with\nbicep\nand I have already a lot of bicep files\nthat deploy to blob storage that deploy\nto because the static sites on blob\nstorage and that deploy to functions the\nonly hard part I think I'm going to\nencounter it's probably going to be a\npain is the front door stuff\nbut I've been considering moving it from\nAzure front door\nbecause I got an email saying like oh\nAzure front door classic is getting\nretired so I'm gonna have to move stuff\nanyway uh moving it to something like\nCloud Fair flare\nso we'll see\nhow that goes but yeah I would love to\nmake this an Azure developer template\nthat way people can do azd template\nAzure resume and then have their own\nimplementation ready to gouh I'm gonna use your suggestion as\nvideo blog posting with weekly progress\nupdates easier to particularly my words\nthan spilling my thoughts on blog yeah\nand don't feel like you have to be too\npolished\num\nlike I wish I would have documented more\nof my career earlier on\nbut I was so scared of coming off like\nif I would have documented my help desk\ndays my Sid to admin days and like early\nclass engineer days\nI feel like that content would have been\nso much more useful\nthan\nlike any of the technical stuff that I\ndo now\nnot to say that the technical stuff that\nI do now doesn't have any use but I just\nfeel like there's a lot of stuff that\none figures out in their career that you\ntake how you kind of take for granted\nand would be very valuable to look back\non but also to share with othersuh let me see here okay awesome well for\nsure I think let's see bicep is the\nthing that kicks my butt mind if I check\nout the infra directories let me drop\nyou some some URLs here that are like\nthat'll give you uh insight as to what\nso I have some in front in here\num\nso I said in friend here so if you take\na look at this one\nthis one's just deploying functions and\nstorage application insight\nboom but let me also show you theum hold on the azd\ntemplate\nwhere are you\nto do C sharp SQL\nplaylists hold on\nsequel Funk yeah take a look at this one\nhere too\nthis one's deploying a lot I think this\nis the playing on static web apps\nuh so you have front end and back end\nhere\nso that's a good one\nyeah but I think\nbicep was a little tough for me to to\nlearn but it wasn't untilum like working on the Azure developer\ntemplate like the to do SQL SWA Funk one\nthat I was like okay I finally\nunderstand this\nyou're using Main and resource I saw\nsome of the templates like yeah use that\nSEC look at that second one like when I\nworked on that\num there's a bunch in there there's like\napp there's core\num they have parameter files\nand this one doesn't have a resource but\nit opts to have a bunch of different\nmodules there's a lot in that one that\nwas a tough one tough oneyeah it's like with with bicep or with\ninfrastructure is code it's like\nif if you can have so much like the goal\nis to have so much abstraction\nlike it's like oh can I make this it's\nsort of like the way I think about it is\nlike when you're when you're developing\nlike a website and you're using like a\ncomponent based framework and your\nmindset is like oh should this be a\ncomponent or should this group of things\nbe one componentlike it's like the same concept that I\nhave with like bicep and modules like\nso yeah but anyway take a look at thatI'm a simple man give me three services\nand I'm out yeah\nthe good thing is like once you figure\nout like a massive thing like this like\nyou're gonna reuse a lot of it\nlike I never\nfrom scratch do a deploy a bicep uh\nfashion functional device like I'll\nalways just reuse it I'll just copy\npaste\nuh I'll try to I'll try to look I'll try\nto do the azd that would be a good video\nthough\nAzure developer template for the cloud\nresume\nit's just it's just the front door stuff\nthat's gonna kick my buttyeah\nlet me see how long have we been\nstreaming for 53 minutes all right\nI'm gonna sign off y'all because it's\nbeen an hour and it's family time I\nrecently adopted a cat\nlet me show y'all a picture\nof my cute cat uh I recently adopted a\ncat yes yes so I gotta go give my cat\nsome attention\nhold on this picture here\nlook\nthat's my cat her name is ZoeI gotta go give her attention she's\nactually on the couch right now which is\nright behind my camera\num but yeah I have to go give my cat and\nmy partner attention very important so\nwhenever I do my next stream maybe then\nwe'll put together some bicep\ninfrastructure\npeace out everyone\noh and don't get scammed by boot
