  "transcript": "let's talk about roles I've been\nrejected from I'm gonna try to recall\nthese from memory uh probably should\nwritten them down but whatever\ninterestingly enough the first job I\napplied to as a professional adult I\nthink I was 18 or 19. I think actually\n19. was the Apple Store gig and I did\nget that job so kind of kicked off my\njourney as a working adult pretty well\nafter I left the Apple Store gig I\napplied to a bunch of help desk roles\nand things like that and I got rejected\nfrom a bunch of them\nand I re I remember I\nspoke to like this I.T recruiting\nfirm like their job is to get I.T\nprofessionals\nuh jobs you know and so a lot of them\nwere like contract based kinds of things\nand they even had\nlike weekend jobs for people and I\nremember\nthat I didn't have any search or\nanything like that and and the recruiter\nI was working with at that firm\ntold me like you should probably get\nsomething like a plus you know it\ndefinitely helps\nand I was really stubborn back then you\nknow I'm at this point maybe like 21 22.\nuh and I I had bought the a plus book\nbut it was like so like massive it was\nlike really big book\nand I looked through it in like the\nfirst couple chapters of like this is a\nmouse and like this is a USB port and\nthings like that and I was like I don't\nwanna\nthis seems like a waste of time to me\nI'm not saying a plus is a waste of time\nI'm just saying that's what was my\nmindset by the given so\nI remember she told me like and I was at\nthis point too I remember having like\nnegative 200 in my bank account so I was\ndesperate to get anything\nI could\num yeah and and I remember she calls me\none day he's like hey uh we haven't\nfound anything kind of like semi\nfull-time or contract or anything for\nyou but there are a couple of weekend\ngigs there's one this Sunday actually\nand you're just gonna need to go there\nfor the day they're gonna pay you like I\ndon't know 24 an hour and you need to\njust unbox PCS and set them up I was\nlike all right great I can do that do I\nneed to bring anything\nand uh she was like all you probably\nneed is like a box cutter I didn't have\na box cutter and so I went out and I\nbought a box cutter\num and then I you know waited for the\nday I wasn't really looking forward to\nit but I needed the money so whatever\nand then that morning she calls me like\nas I'm literally leaving uh she calls me\nis like hey they canceled the gig no\nneed to go and I remember feeling that\nmoment feeling just like\nI have to do something else with my life\nlike I have there's something has to\ncome up like I gotta make I gotta make\nsome kind of a move\nso anyway later on I go back on to like\nindeed or I think it was indeed and I\nfound the help desk gig that I\neventually ended up Landing\nand again I think it was at that point\njust a numbers game and yeah I had like\nthe\ntechnical experience from like\ntroubleshooting phones at the Apple\nStore\nbut\nyeah I guess it was just like a lot of\nluck for that first one but anyway it\nwas like it's my first stint of\nrejection\nafter they helped us gig about a year\nand I started applying other roles\nbecause I was just really unhappy\nand this was even before taking my\nclouds or some AWS certification and\nkind of being like yeah I want to get\ninto Cloud I more so was more I was more\nfocused on I just want to get out of\nhelp desk at this help desk gig so I was\napplying to Sis admin gigs I was\napplying to other help desk gigs I would\npay more that were closer because even\nthat first help desk gig was like an\nhour and 10 commute with like good\ntraffic I also had like a really bad car\nback then I had an O3 Mitsubishi Lancer\nbut on the outside it was nice but on\nthe inside the engine\nI'll add so many issues like I remember\nwe had to\nessentially Jerry rig the fuel pump\nbecause it stopped working and we had to\nsomehow like my dad's an electrician so\nhe's good with uh you know those types\nof things for some reason the fuel pump\nwouldn't power and so it wouldn't start\nto cut like when you start the car it\nwouldn't power the fuel pump for some\nreason so he had to like\nwired directly from I don't know exactly\nhow he did it but I remember he ended up\nputting like a switch uh by like my\ndashboards like oh click this turn this\non first and then you turn your car on\nbecause I look uh that that switch will\nturn the fuel pump on and your car will\nturn on later on it had radiator issues\ntoo\nlater on the key broke so my when my dad\nended up help my dad ended up helping\nwas we got like um this was army knife\nand kind of just like stabbed it in\nthere so my key my key was this army\nknife for a while yeah that was terrible\nbut anyway it made the commute much\nworse right\nso yeah I was looking for help desk\nkicks that were closer uh sis admin gigs\nthings like that\nI remember calling uh applying to this\nrole like a sis admin assistant admin\ngig and I was like I really want this\ngig because it pays more I think it was\nsomewhere around like mid 20 dollars\nin the mid-20s per hour and it was\ncloser it was significantly closer I\nthink the commute was going to be\nsomething like 20 minutes from where I\nwas living and I was like I really want\nthis gig like pay some more it's closer\nperfect I apply for it I think I think I\nhad the ability for everything that they\nasked for and I remember a couple of\ndays after applying getting a call back\nfrom from that number\nand I was so excited and it was some one\nof their HR people who was in charge uh\nI don't remember their name or anything\nlike that but it was one of the HR\npeople in charge of chart of of hiring\nand she calls me she's like hey calling\nyou back about your application uh we're\nnot going to move forward but I didn't\nwant to talk to you about your resume\nand proceeded to just bash my resume\nthis is wrong this wrong you shouldn't\ndo this you shouldn't do that\nfeedback is awesome constructive\nfeedback is really great like and\nobviously I I have the Insight now to\nlook back at it and be like okay\nI did end up applying the tips that she\ngave me on my resume and I'm guessing\nthat it helped for jobs later on\nbut that feedback was delivered in such\na difficult way and at that time where I\nkind of felt like I was a little bit\nmore vulnerable because I just wanted a\nway out of that gig to find my next step\nI don't know I felt like it just ruined\nmy day I was also younger uh and a lot\nless emotionally mature so there was\nthat but then that was another rejection\nI also applied to Spotify for a support\ngig there too and I never got a reply\nback I felt like I got a reply like six\nmonths later\nand it was something like hey no we're\nnot gonna move you forward and I was\nlike well this is great information to\nhave six months later so anyway more\nrejection there but\nI did end up getting Asus admin gig that\nended up going to like turning into the\ncloud engineering gig and overall just a\nvery pivotal face in my life but anyway\nget this as admin gig promotion to call\nengineer and around that time I was also\nlooking for like I want to go do\nno actually this was\nbefore promotional Cloud engineer\nbecause I remember to get the promotion\nto be Cloud energy from my sis admin gig\nI really had to fight that like I really\nhad to make my case and it wasn't with\nmy manager was on my side but it was\nmore so making the case for on like the\nsea level people\nso it took like a couple months for that\nto happen like once I was like oh I\ndeserve this I've done this and my\nmanager was like yes you do deserve this\nlet's go figure out how we can get this\nfor you there wasn't really a formal\nprocess for promotion so I remember that\nwas months and I was getting very\nfrustrated\nso at that time\nI was open to roles that weren't\nnecessarily Cloud related\nwhich I'm glad it didn't end up working\nout that way because\nI probably I don't know if I would have\nended up in cloud\nbut the possibilities there that I\nwouldn't have right\nso\nI again applied to a spot to Spotify it\nwas I think I think the role was\nsomething like SAS operations engineer\nessentially you know\nputting together how certain SAS\napplications work uh for like internally\nwhich I thought was interesting because\nI had some experience with doing stuff\nlike it's like you know 365 jira things\nlike that\nand I that whole the whole interviewing\nprocess there\nI guess this doesn't count like this\nrejection because I\nwithdrew from the application process I\nremember doing three interviews and in a\nspan of a couple of weeks and after that\nI don't know I can't remember exactly\nwhat happened but the recruit I was\nworking with was great and then I think\nI didn't hear back for like two weeks\nand then I heard back\nand it was telling them they had told me\nlike oh we're searching recruiters\nand there was another two weeks and then\nthe new recruiter came to me but only\nafter I was like oh I want to\nI want to know what's going on like\nseveral times and then the new recruiter\ncomes on it's like oh hey yeah we want\nto move you on to the the final round\nbut this whole process had been like\nfour or five weeks or something like\nthat\nand at that point I was like I'm not I\ndon't want to do this\nso I removed myself from that uh\ninterview process and then ended up\ngetting the content promotion at the gig\nthat I was at so it worked out great\nbut that was another uh rejection I\nthink around this not rejection but\nanother role that didn't work out but\nthat was a good thing right\nanother around this time too I applied\nto AWS not for a cloud I think maybe it\nwas a closet Port kind of role I we got\nrejected from that without even like I\ndidn't pass into like the I got an\nautomated rejection let's say that uh\ntowards the end of my time as a\ncollection at that company I applied to\nMicrosoft for the first time\ngot rejected uh right up automated\nautomated system rejection\nand then\nafter I joined\na cloud Guru I think towards the\nbeginning I had uh applied toor maybe right before I joined a club\nright around that time I applied to make\nsure for the second time\nand this was like a direct like someone\non one of the teams got my resume sent\nit over to the hiring manager and the\nhiring manager got and I applied manager\ngot back to me he's like hey resume\nlooks great but it doesn't seem like the\nexact fate that what we're looking for\nso that was the the second rejection\nthere\nand then obviously the third one was the\none that I ended up getting which I I\nreply to like six months after this or\non that time frame again these time\nframes are kind of blurry to me\num be it yes yeah overall lots of\nrejection but I feel like I mean\nobviously it all has worked out\nand it's been good\nearlier on it hurts a lot more and I'm\nsure I'll face more rejections in my\ncareer as I go on but I feel like I I'm\na lot more well equipped to handle them\nbut yeah just just some stories I wanted\nto share\num I would love to hear projections that\nyou all face so share them in the\ncomments\nand yeah I just think these are topics\nthat people should talk a little bit\nmore about\nall right peace out",
