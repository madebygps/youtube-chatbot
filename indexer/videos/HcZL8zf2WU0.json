  "transcript": "I'm gonna go back here pull this up here\nlet me refresh my YouTubedamn we got nine people waitingall right I did a command like a custom\ncommand for your stuff\num it's like exclamation day so let me\nsee if it actually works yeah there we\ngo and then people can get all your\nlinks I grabbed your like your solo dot\ntwo\nfrom your Twitter that and it looked\nlike that had everything in it so\nyeah yeah so we got people coming in so\nwhat up everyone\nuh welcome settle in settle in they and\nI were already talking but then we we're\nlike oh we gotta go live so we hit live\nI'm trying something a little different\nI'm using collab cam on streamlabs I\ndon't know if you've heard about it Dave\nit's like this new feature that\nstreamlabs came up with and hopefully it\ndoesn't like bug out on us in the middle\nof the stream yeah but we're here to\ntalk all things\ncyber security Cloud work\nsocial media YouTube monk mode all these\nkinds of things I we haven't really\nspoken since\nwhen it was it you were in here in New\nYork like July ish no August no Julyokay around that time yeah around that\ntime and then we talked a little bit\nafter you did the learn to Cloud stuff\nwhich was\nlike a couple weeks after that\nyeah yeah yeah and then\nwe've been like I don't know I I always\nreply to your Instagram stories and your\nreels because I think you're one of the\nrealest person everyone is the realest\npeople in the game\num which is cool and whatnot but yeah\npeople come in uh we're here to talk\nwhere should we start manfrom the beginning\nlike what like okay let me start by like\nthe craziest thing you're are you 21 yetyeah so you can't you still can't drink\nillegally you still can't drink for all\nlegal intents and purposes\num\nhe is uh hold on let me check the volume\nit says can't hear Dave via YouTube Let\nme see\nyou're coming in here good\nuh let me see\nah we don't have audio for day let me\nsee let me see oh hold on let's do this\nall right how about now can you say\nsomething oh check check can you guys\nhear me\nyeah I think they can hear you now\nuh yeah yeah I think I had to configure\nyour\nyou're just about you okay all right\ngood get in my bed\num\nwhat what was I gonna say oh yeah so\nyou're still you still legally can't\nhave a drink with me\nI remember like when you were in New\nYork I was like yo let's go get a drink\nand you're like I'm 20.\nno I'm still 20.\num till uh February of next year are you\ngonna have a big big party\nhonestly I don't think so it's not your\nvibe I don't really like parties\num I'm just I don't know what I'm gonna\ndo yet\num\nI don't know last this year I went to\nlike I did a getaway I just like went to\nlike the woods for like two days by\nyourself yeah that's how you celebrate\nyeah that was no that was literally\nthat's really what I did and I was just\nlike chilling there alone\num I don't know I don't I really don't\nknow how to like celebrate like stuff\nlike birthdays or like things in general\nso I feel you I just tend to like just\nyou know do it alone or just like I\ndon't know do something random so I\nhonestly don't know yet I feel like my\nmaybe like my my friends or my family\nmight try to like do something so we'll\nsee 21 is a big uh\na big a big age I feel I feel like it's\none of the last\nages that you want to celebrate actually\nI do agree because after that what 30\nand then you know it's all downhillI do think like for me like I do things\nlike 25 is going to be a big milestone\nage for me because I have a lot of\nthings that I've been working towards at\n25 from like when I was 19 like when I\nwas like 19\nbefore I turned 19. before I turned 20\nlike I have I have this board where I\nhave things that I want to get to by 25\nSo like\num and they started from like you know\nbeing 20 So like\num I think that's going to be a big\nmilestone age because like I'm gonna\nlook back and like really be able to\nlike point back to those things that I\nyou know I'm working towards because\nlike\nI'm I've not I've not reached my final\nform yet oh definitely not with like\nwith the amount of things that you do\nand we'll get into this I just and\nalready what you've accomplished so\nyou're 20. uh what's your official title\nat datadog I am a detection engineer\nthat's what my title is detection\nengineer at datadog you're still in\nschool\nand you're also in like like a teacher\nright I don't know what your official\ntitle is yes it's a cyber security tutor\ncyber security tutor at a like local\nCollege yeah at a community college\nCommunity College you're also a YouTuber\nand you're also killing it on Instagram\nwith the reels and whatnot and you're I\ndon't know there's overall it's like\nlike a fantastic person and we met back\nin the summer and then I was just so\nlike floored by how much you've\naccomplished\nby 20.\nlike and you had yeah because I was back\nin the summer so it technically just\nhave turned 21 up but I wanna I wanna\ntalk to you a little bit about first\ncertification so we can dive into other\nthings later but certifications first\nyou and I both I feel have like a love\nhate an interesting relationship with\ncertifications and I want to ask you\nbecause a lot of your your reels are\nlike in like short form content is\ncentered around certifications and sort\nof how you feel about them so yeah give\ngive the people like an overview of\ncourse like what certs do you have which\nones are actually useful and are you\nworking towards any any certifications\nin the context of like Cloud security\num okay there's a there's a lot to\nunpack there yeah I know because because\nlike certifications are\nvery controversial\num I don't think they need to be I just\nthink like they're either oversimplified\nor over complicated yeah um so\num I was I was in a like a podcast with\nlike another\num uh content creator like a while back\nand we're talking about certifications\nand he asked me like what has been the\nmost important certification you've\ntaken\num in your career so far and I there was\nthis particular one I you know talked\nabout but I I the main thing I wanted to\nsay was that\nI don't think any of them was\nparticularly important okay like at the\ntime that I took the certifications they\nmade sense for that time and they were\ngood for that time right it was like at\nthat point in time where I had this\ncertification I took the certification\nit was\num it was needed I needed to take that\ncertification at that time yeah right\nnow I have about 12 13 certifications\nthat are active\num and each of them had a purpose um\nwhich I took them yeah so I initially\nstarted as someone who was getting into\nthe industry and like I didn't really\nknow much and I didn't have much\nexperience or skill so I needed\nsomething to like push my credentials\nright okay and this is someone this is\nlike as a college freshman right I'm\nstill trying to figure out stuff so of\ncourse like when it comes to it like the\nHoly Grail of like entry level\ncertification wait wait wait hold up let\nme pause it you said College freshmen so\nyou mean like last year\num two years ago two years ago\ntwo years ago a long long time ago two\nyears ago all right all right cool\ncontinue yeah this was uh this was 2020.all right all right all right so\num come to like you know Holy Grail of\nlike entry-level certifications come to\nyour a plus right\nyeah that's the one that's gonna change\nyour life that's the six figure one\nright there no it was it was it and like\nthe way it did it in a really really\ninteresting way because I failed it the\nfirst time it was my first ever\ncertification and I failed it the first\ntime right and like I was like I was\nlike it like that really like I was down\nby that like I was like dang I literally\npaid like you know like 300 for two\nexams and I failed both of those two\nexams right yeah so like I was like\nreally devastated I was like you know\nbecause I was just getting into the into\nthe industry I was like I can't pass\nthis exam right but like that's the exam\neveryone talks about like if you go on\nReddit like the a plus yeah the a plus\nlike when you if you want to get to it\nokay yeah like literally everyone says\ngo get the A Plus at least at least you\nknow looking back two years three years\nago right that's so that was the Holy\nGrail of like if you want to get to I.T\nNetwork and cyber security whatever it\nis go get the a plus all right\num and then do the countier trifecta a\nplus number plus Security Plus okay so\num I was like you know I'm gonna start\nfrom the A Plus and I was also looking\nfor like a help desk job or like an I.T\ntechnician job and I felt like it would\nyou know help me with that so to help\ndesk girl\nbecause I didn't have\nany specific skills or anything you're a\nfreshman at WGU at this point or is this\nanother another school no so I was a\nfreshman at the school I currently tutor\nout right now oh\num yeah so WG wasn't until last year\nokay okay cool cool all right cool\nso you know but I you know after my\nsecond uh attempt I passed the exam and\nthen it was just like like that like the\nexperience of like just like passing the\nexam like really taught me a lot so like\nthat was really when I started like this\nlike journey of like just being a a word\nI just recently learned about a Didact\nso like you know learning on your own\nself teaching yourself stuff yeah\nexactly that self-taught uh Journey yeah\num and um I that was like you know the\nbeginning of like you know constant\nstudying you know like self-improvement\nboth in like you know career and like\nlife in general so yeah this was a\nperiod also when I was like you know\nreally just like cutting out of\ndifferent things like\num you know video games social media\nfriends all about that right you know\nmaybe we can talk about more about that\nlater on but um so a plus um and then I\nstarted studying for the number plus and\nthis period I was applying for like a\nbunch of internships um entry level\npositions uh help desk positions and I\ngot the opportunity for my first cyber\nsecurity internship\num after like various field um\ninternships and attempts and stuff like\nthat\num so I got that job and right before I\ngot the offer for the internship I\npassed my number plus so like a couple\nof weeks before I was gonna start I\npassed Network plus um and that really\nhelped me with like learning networking\nfor them tools and all that okay and\nthen first day of my internship\num the security Engineers shadowing was\nlike Hey take the security textbook\nSecurity Plus textbook study it it will\nreally help you with this internship\nlike help you understand what you're\ndoing here and really security stuff so\nI took the book ready cover to cover\ntook a bunch of udemy courses passed\nthat so that was like the whole journey\nfor how long did that one take you\num security so I passed never Plus in\nSeptember\num of 2020 and I passed the Security\nPlus in November so it took me about\ntwo months ish to pass the Security Plus\nwas there any overlap or completely\ndifferent content so if you go the a\nplus nerd plus Security Plus route there\nis a lot of like overlap across each\nthree so it's like okay number plus\nboots on the a plus and the Security\nPlus Builds on the never plus and the a\nplus okay so like they and also like\nonce you've done that many computer\nexams you kind of have to understanding\nof what you're looking for or what\nyou're looking for okay in their exams\nso that was kind of like the journey and\nthen afterwards my next uh certification\nwas the\num I'm actually looking at my LinkedIn\nright now it was the Splunk course\ncertified user\num that one was because\nI was learning Splunk on my own I was\nbuilding labs and stuff like that and we\ntalked about Labs later on\num but I was you know work I was\nbuilding one of labs of my own with\nSplunk and learning about Splunk and\nstuff like that and I was like I want to\nwork in a company that uses Splunk right\nbecause like that's like kind of like\nthe de facto Sim\num in the cyber security industry at\nleast at that time\num so I you know went ahead and got the\ncertification\num and then fortunately around that\nperiod I interviewed for\num my the threat analyst position my\nlast job yeah um and um got the position\nand I started working with Splunk was\nthat in are they sort of internship or\nfull-time role\nuh that was a full-time role my\ninternship was like\nthat was like uh my internship ended\nMarch of last year\num and then I had an I then immediately\nafter that my first full-time role\nstarted March of what of that much of\nthat same year yeah but it was a\ndifferent job so that was I was a suck\nanalyst in that role I worked there for\nabout three months before I got my last\njob as a threat analyst\nso\num okay um so right before I started my\nlast job I was three analyst um I failed\nthe cyc plus from CompTIA\num I I quite frankly wasn't ready I\nwould say the exam is a beast of an exam\nokay\num and um I failed it um but I took it\nagain past then\num August of 2021 which was last year I\ngot the AWS Cloud practitioner this is\npart of a wgu's\num\nshout out to WGU yeah uh that was part\nof the network operations and security\nprogram and that um also kind of a\nlittle bit um picked my interest in\nCloud a lot more than I had had in Cloud\num also I took the Azure fundamentals\nthis was May 2021\num and then I took the ITIL\ncertification in August 2021 took the\nLinux Essentials I know that that\ncertification has a special place heck\nyeah I love that love that so yeah that\nwas also part of the WGU program as well\nyeah then\num this year I have taken three\ncertifications the first one was in\nFebruary of this year um that was The\nBlue Team level one total Beast of an\nexam one of the best certifications is\nthat the 24-hour one yes yes that was\nlike that that one is like there's a\nlevel two I'm considering taking it that\nwas like a 72 hour one a lot more\nadvanced\num but I don't know where I'm gonna take\nthat one\num and then I took another one the\noffensive Azure one that was also 24\nhours that was also that's also like a\nnewer certification like Azure pen\ntesting um definitely valuable enjoyed\nthat one as well and recently just took\nthe come to your project boss um because\nI had to take it for WGU yeah for my\nprogram so I I did not enjoy that\ncertification at all like it it it did a\nlot to me like mentally\num but I've got I I cut out of it but\nyeah that's kind of my entire\ncertification Journey with timestamps\nall right we we got sort of the context\nof the certifications you got now I'm\ngonna ask you some tough questions first\nof all\ndo you think you'd be where you're at\nwithout any certificationno okay okay no no\num I think\nso I I don't think I would be wearing my\nwithout those certifications because\nthey thought they they taught me how to\nlearn on my own\num and I think that is a lot more\nvaluable than the actual certification\nitself\nall right like because like I didn't\nlike I didn't have like any like you\nknow I didn't go to any you know\nbootcamp or instructor or like you know\nanything I've pretty much touched my\ntaught myself all of this stuff so like\nthe ability to like you know go out\nthere and just like learn something on\nmy own\num has been a lot more valuable than the\ncertifications themselves yeah um but I\nwouldn't say like I could have done it\ndifferently\num but no okay I wouldn't all right yeah\nso going back to that Trifecta right A\nPlus Security Plus network plus to where\nyou're at now if you could if you could\nonly you go back and take just one which\none B would be the most useful for you\num let's contagious one yeah\nI would saythe most useful the number plus to be\nhonest I think it's like the web balance\nbetween the a plus and Security Plus\nokay Security Plus I could learn\nthe security plus stuff from a lot more\nother things like labs and like books\num like I could definitely learn that I\ncould have just read the security plus\nbook like a couple of times and a bunch\nof other security books\num you know done a bunch of labs and I\nwould you know pick up all of those\nConcepts over time\num and also with my experience like I\ncould have gotten those things but like\na plus\num I don't think it was as necessary\nyeah um but still valuable\num I mean to me you know at that time\nand then Network plus was like the\nreally good balance between the both\nlike I taught you some a level of\nsecurity stuff but the networking stuff\nyou learn from Network plus is also\nreally valuable because like you just\ncan't trade that you know like the the\nnetworking stuff just always comes back\nright yeah you always have to like you\nalways have to you know know like you\nknow IP address and you have to know\nyour DNS you have to know like your\nrouting and stuff like that like somehow\nit comes back and like if you are Gonna\nGo Far in your cyber security career or\nyou know um even like a technical career\nin general you have to kind of stuff\nlike the different protocols like\nunderstanding like the you know OSI\nstack even if it's like deprecated or\nwhatever but like really understanding\nthat stuff like at each level is really\nimportant and like it's still I still\nuse it to this day especially cyber\nsecurity because like each layer of that\num you know stack has different attacks\num associated with them so like when\nyou're analyzing logs or analyzing\ndifferent activities and stuff like that\nlike it's it's it's very valuable just\nhaving like that framework or that\nConcept in your head um and also just\nthe knowledge so I would say the network\nplus\num definitely and in hindsight I wish I\nhad to spend more time on it but I did\nhave a really strong networking uh\nbackground from like some of my classes\nand you know that definitely helped me\nyeah no I feel you the\nI\nwhen I was applying to help those gigs I\nsaw a lot of like a plus as like\nrequirements and I was just like I'm not\ntaking this exam because I was like a\nvery cocky and arrogant 20 like 20 year\nold like 19 20 year old maybe 21-ish at\nthat time and I'm like because I was\nreading through the content and I'm like\nthis thing is like this is a mouse and\nI'm like why would I need to spend\nmonths and like this much and I was also\nbroke I didn't want to spend 300 on exam\nso I'm like I'm just not gonna take this\nbut I was I was technically Savvy and\nthen I also had like like the Apple\nStore job kind of experience so I knew\nhow to like take\num tickets and whatnot so I landed like\ninterviews and whatnot and they were\nlike yeah whatever like we I feel like\nthey use that a lot as like to filter\nout people\num and to filter out resumes and whatnot\nbut I would still say like even if you\ndon't have a plus like go and apply to\nthese roles because if you I mean if you\nknow the stuff if you don't then\nobviously go and learn it and then a\nplus could be a potentially good way of\nlearning it but yeah I I yeah I remember\nI bought that book The a plus book and\nit was like freaking so thick\nall right oh my goodness I don't even\nwant to like do this so luckily it\nworked out for me but yeah I do also\nthink that um sometimes like the\npressure of the exam makes you lose out\non like learning\num and I think you can really relate to\nthis um from like the Linux Essentials\nlike you really spend a lot of time\nstudying like the Linux Concepts and you\nstill hold a lot of them like you still\nuse them on a daily basis but like when\nthere's like a pressure I have to take\nan exam and pass the exam yeah from what\nI'm learning sometimes you tend to like\nlimit your self you tend to like rather\nyou you tend to sacrifice long-term\nknowledge for like a short term like\nokay I'll I'll I'll just remember this\nfor the exam right and then like you\nknow you lose that you know in the long\nthe long run so something I do advise\npeople these days is like just like do\nthe course or like just you know read\nthe book and like learn the concepts and\nyou don't necessarily have to take exam\nlike just know it for the sake of\nknowing it\nI I like what you said at the beginning\nwhere like certifications are either\nover hyped or undervalued and I think\nthe overhype part comes a lot from like\nTech influencers\nand we I don't want to get too ranty on\nit because you and I have spoken about\nthis but it's like you know you see so\nmuch content of like top 10 paying\ncertifications and it's like you know\nhaving been on YouTube you kind of get a\nfeel for how these people are and it's\nlike they they don't even work in Tech\nor like oh how like you need this\ncertification roadmap but like that they\nthemselves didn't go through that to\nlike actually get a job and whatnot and\nthen there's the other people were like\ncerts have absolutely no ballet so when\nyou did your when you did your reel of\nlike\noh do you need search or projects and\nyou were like you need both that like\nthat balance is kind of like what I want\nto ask you next is\nsay I'm like I don't say I got like a\nlevel like a year of help desk\nexperience right and I'm trying to like\nupscale in security because that's what\nI I want to get into what two\ncertifications would you recommend I go\nand study for and like take my time uh\nto really like learn what I have to\nlearn to get like an entry-level\nsecurity role or a role that has some\nsort of aspect of security in it\num so I would say that so I would assume\nright from the help desk like you're\nfamiliar with like some sort of\nnetworking\num you know some sort of like\num I.T stuff right I'm pretty sure maybe\nlike you're working with active\ndirectory all the time so like you're\nprobably like you know pretty decent at\nsome things here and there right so like\nat that point I would I would point you\nto two certifications\num two of which are not necessarily like\nindustry standard um in terms of like\nyou know if you're looking for a job or\nwhatever but I think these two are like\nthe Holy Grail of like you know you'll\nit opens you up to limited options right\nbecause I was gonna say it depends on\nlike you know what kind of security rule\nyou want to get into which is sometimes\nhard to make a decision on yeah but\num so these two are actually on two\nopposing ends so in security would\ntypically look at things sometimes from\nlike the defensive side and the\noffensive side so defensive side is like\nyou know people who are monitoring the\nnetworks detecting different activities\nyou would consider you consider me as a\ndetection engineer on a defensive side\nthe offensive side are like people who\nare trying to emulate like you know\nactual attacker activity you know pen\ntesters you know and ethical hackers and\nthings of s word so\num the two certifications I recommend on\nthat being said is\nuh the Practical Network penetration\ntester from the from TCM security\num\nand The Blue Team level one from\nsecurity blue team yeah like which is\none I've taken myself\num the reasons behind this is because\nBluetooth level one is practical there's\nno multiple choice\num I know the exam is different but it's\nactually a practical exam you're thrown\ninto a compromised environment and\nyou're asked to investigate you know the\nmalicious activity that has happened in\nthis environment\num and create a report from that\nactivity so that's you know first reason\nwhy because like it's practical and they\ngive you the you know resources you need\nto\num\noh I think Morgan\nokay all right thank you for the\nresources to\num everything everything you need is no\nresources right now and with the price\nright so it's about 500\num but you don't you don't need like\nthere's you don't have to go out there\nto like source for extra resources right\nyeah so it's like you pay 500 for four\nmonths of access to the material they\nteach you everything and you're and then\nyou do the Practical exam okay um and\nthis is on the defensive side and you\nlearn a lot like that exam is like a lot\nof new organizations now that are like\nhiring like security analysts entry\nlevel analysts they're making\nrequirements for those people or they\nmake their analysts take that training\nas part of like their onboarding where\nthey start so it gives you you know\nknowledge on that side\nthen the other one is the Practical\nNetwork pen tester from TCM security\nthat was around like I believe like\naround two or three hundred dollars\ndepending on like what package you pay\nfor which is very affordable in terms of\nlike certifications and what you get out\nof that that one gives you Insight from\nthe\num uh from the offensive side and what\nthese two have in common is you're\ndealing with Windows or active directory\non both ends one way or another so on\nthe pmpt side you're you know you're\ncompromising the active directory\nenvironment\num and you know uh creating a report on\nyou know how you did that on the TCM on\nthe Bluetooth level one side you're\ninvestigating an activity against like\nyou know what sort of active directory\nenvironment but not necessarily an\nactive directory environment but there's\nthere are windows environment there are\nwindows devices in the environment so\nyou have to do you know that as well so\nhaving knowledge on these two ends makes\nyou a\nRockStar at least at the entry level if\nyou have like that Knowledge from both\nends because like a lot goes into\nlearning the material and doing the exam\nand passing the exam but if you have\nboth I am very certain that if you go\ninto any Fair interview as an\nentry-level stock analyst I don't know\nabout pen tester but for as an entry\nlevel stock analyst you would be able to\nanswer a lot of the questions that\nthey're going to ask you and actually\nsucceed at the role at the entry level\nbecause you have the understanding of\nlike what you're most likely going to be\ndoing as an analyst so those are my\nrecommendations so\ncan if if you study for those two\ncertifications\nand I'm just gonna tell people like\nthese aren't things that you can\nmemorize this and this is what I love\nabout the security space it's like\ncertifications actually test your\nknowledge and the CL and which is why\nthey're valued more than how\ncertifications are valued in the cloud\nspace and the cloud space you can\nmemorize everything and that's why you\nsee people on LinkedIn sharing like\niPass certifications every single week\nit's like yeah because they're not hard\nlike you can go and like buy like the\npacket of like\num the questions for like 20 off some\nwebsite and then you memorize everything\nand then you go and pass like it doesn't\nreally prove but in the security space\nlike these are Labs these are things\nthat you actually have to do you\nactually have to Showcase your knowledge\nso this isn't something that you can\nspend a couple of weeks on like I mean\nunless you spend like all every day all\nday studying for them but it's going to\ntake a good amount of time so do you\nthink with like those two shirts taking\na lot of time but without any technical\nexperience someone can go and land like\na sock analyst role\nyes because those two certifications\ncome with training that gets you up to\nspeed right so like this is not these\nthey're they're targeted at entry-level\npeople right for The Blue Team level one\nit explicitly States on their website\nand actually even did a video about this\nrecently that it's targeted for students\nI.T personal you know very entry-level\npeople right so like all the content you\nneed is on there and they're like\nsupplementary Labs you can do so this is\neven if you gain all the knowledge from\nlike the material they they're extra\nLabs like they point you to that you can\ndo to enhance your knowledge you're not\njust doing like the\num you know the course material there's\nextra Labs you do to practice and\nactually you know prove your skills yeah\num or um build on those skills you're\nlearning in the actual course so yes you\nthink people can land it all right all\nright people so that's yeah I I'll Stand\nto that like good news anytime I like\nthat because I mean so usually what I I\ntell people to get in cloud is like\nyou're gonna spend six months kind of\nlike you know work support and then\nspend six months kind of upscaling these\nareas that I usually recommend and then\nwith that I feel like you could go and\nland a cloud role essentially the amount\nof time that people would take to study\nfor these classes these security\ncertifications would be somewhat similar\num and you can go and like land these\nthese entry-level security rules so I\nlike that it sounds like people also\nneed to kind of figure out what they're\naiming for like what roles they're\naiming for becausepeople are like I want to get into Cloud\nsecurity but from what I've learned from\nyou it's like well what does that mean\nlike there's so many different like\nspaces like security is just essentially\njust like saying Cloud now because you\ncan secure so many different things so\nit sounds like people need to be able to\nFirst do research on like what role and\nsecurity they want to get into but do\nyou think no matter what role like a\ngood like kind of like get into the\nspace it's just two these two certs and\nthen go sock analysts and then kind of\nfigure out what Niche you want to go\ninto\nyeah I do think like\num you know like stock analyst\num which is typically like the the entry\nlevel type Pros\num or maybe Junior during your instant\nresponder like um even like\nI've seen like the pmpt being put out\nfor like Junior pantester roles so like\num I don't know I'm not too you know\nprivy with like the pen testing space I\ndo think like it's also like a it's it's\naccepted in that space as well yeah so\nlike it could also help with like people\nwho want to get into like Junior\ncontestant roles um but those are a lot\nmore competitive\num but I would say like most entry-level\nsecurity roles even like like if you if\nyou're if you're like a college student\nand you apply for internship and you do\nthat one of those two like you're gonna\nbe a rock star like literally like\nyou're gonna be like you're\nno literally like you're gonna be like\ngreater than me I'm telling you like and\nand getting that start dog like you know\nlike it's it's like that's but like for\nentry level like I definitely think like\nit is it is both are like the pmpt is\ndefinitely getting a level accepted in\nlike the pen testing space all right so\nalong the lines of studying for these\ncertifications I don't think so from\nwhat I've seen from you you don't just\nstudy for them you you create projects\nyou create like posts on whether that be\non like short form or long form like and\nyou have like you've written stuff and\nwhatnot like\nwhat do you recommend people do while\nthey're studying for these things or in\nin addition to studying for these\ncertifications to kind of like just\nimprove their skills but also have like\nstuff that they can show off on their\nresume\nso I think\num like different aspects of\ncertifications can be projectized but\nyou also have like there has to be like\na sort of balance between\nhow much how deep am I going to go into\nthis Rabbit Hole of this project for\nwhat I'm trying to put it for this yeah\nright the goal is to learn and to learn\num to retain and be able to use this\nthese skills when you're working in the\nindustry yeah um but also you also have\nthe goal of trying to pass certification\num which you probably have like a\ndeadline you might have said for\nyourself so I do think like pick him\nmaybe picking one thing or you know a\ncouple of things from that certification\nand just doing like digging deep into\nthem and making products out of them so\nfor example\num like say the\nthese two exams I just talked about\nright perfect like let's say you've\ntaken like you've you've done you know\none of these exams right and you're\ntrying to you know do the other one\nright you've learned a lot a lot a\nlittle bit about like\num fantastic and stuff like that but now\nyou're you're going into like the\nsecurity analyst space right well like\nnow you have the skills to like test\ndifferent attacks right all right then\nyou know\ndeploy a Splunk instance in a virtual\nmachine okay document how you did that\ntry one of the attacks you did on the\nPeterson exam against you know your\nvulnerable environment and walk through\nwhat you found on the logs like that's a\nperfect project to do first you you're\ngoing to show how you deployed Splunk\nhow you set up the login you're going to\nshow how you use how you propagated the\nattack and then you're gonna investigate\nhow that attack happened and then also\nhow you would remediate that that's the\nentire project on its own and imagine if\nyou do that for like you know maybe one\nor two attacks like you don't have to do\nlike you know so much right yeah the\nthing about security is like show like\nshowing that you have the skills and\nunderstanding of like what you're\nlearning right and like you know even\nBeyond just like doing it as a project\nlike you don't know who that thing would\nbe helpful to yeah like I literally have\nmy blog like being featured on like\narticles that I would have never taught\nlike it would ever be like featured on\nto this day so it's like you know just\nlike do it and like just bring Knowledge\nfrom like what you already know and what\nyou're learning together\num and it doesn't have to be anything\nelaborated right so like\num it could just be like a quick walk\nwalkthrough of like how to like fix and\nit uh remediate like a vulnerability and\nlike a Windows system\num that you're able to find uh through\nlike an attack you learn and you know uh\ndependent social certification right so\nor even one thing one of my friends um\nthat recently passed the oicp has been\ndoing he's been creating videos on this\nchannel his name is Teddy um about how\nto make vulnerable machines right like\nif the the machine like it's like okay\neveryone's talking about how to like\nactually break these different things\nhow do you actually create the\nvulnerable machines right okay it's like\nthat's a project idea it's a good take\nyeah yeah so it's like there are\ndifferent angles from which you know you\ncan do this from like um and also like\nthere comes like creativity as well like\nyou know all of the stuff that you know\npeople all the projects that you know a\nlot of people do are like recycled from\nwhat other people have done my product\nmy project is accumulation of like 100\nmillion YouTube videos I wanted to\neventually get to bringing it together\nright but it's like you know it's it's\nUnique and it's original but like I had\nto like learn a lot of stuff from my\ndifferent people and figuring it out so\nlike you know try to be creative and\nlike you know just it doesn't have to be\ntoo much but make it enough um to you\nknow prove the point um about your\nknowledge\nI like\nthat the idea of like you don't have to\nshare absolutely everything or document\nabsolutely everything but you do you\nshould be strategic with what you do put\nthat work into and and ideally so what I\ntend to recommend people in the cloud\nspace is more so have two or three\nprojects or scenarios or whatever you\nwant to call them that you can speak to\nwhen you do get the opportunity to\ninterview so you can speak to them\nconfidently because when you're the more\nentry level you are the more they're\nsort of just testing you of like is this\nsomeone that's worth giving a chance\ninstead of like oh this is someone who\nactually knows what they're talking\nabout that comes like as you grow and\nyou Niche into your career and like\nyou're sort of sought out for like your\nspecific skill set but the more entry\nlevel you are the more wider sort of\nyour your your you know knowledge is and\nwhatnot which is fine like we all start\nsomewhere and like hiring managers know\nthis so if you have like two three\nprojects that you can like you know in\nand out like you documented like you\nreally understand what's going on if\nthere's an issue there's a failure you\nknow how to do it you know why it does\nwork why it doesn't work things you want\nto improve prove you can you can have\nways that you can like if they wanted to\nrun it for some reason like you want to\nrun a demo in the interview like you\ncould do that like two or three that's\nnot like that's not\nI mean it is a lot of work but you don't\nhave to think about like oh every\nchapter of the certification I'm\nstudying I gotta go and document so I\nlike that advice too and it seems like\nit's very\nit's like shared advice across the\ndisciplines right so you you're focused\non security I'm more in the cloud space\nand whatnot but it's good to know that\nyeah I think that we share a lot in\nterms of like\nwhat it takes to land that first that\nfirst roll which I think is cool I I\nwanted to ask you before we move on from\ncertifications how do you feel about\nCloud security certifications like\nbecause Azure has security specialty the\nC the SC certifications AWS has them I\ndon't know if gcp I'm sure gcp has them\nbut how do you feel about them when do\nyou think they're useful\nor if do you think they're useful in\ngeneral\nso I don't have any of those clouds\nsecurity certifications\num and I do I hope to a plan to do\num one I'm kind of just like in a weird\nspace where I do everything and like\nit's kind of hard for me to like\nspecialize on one specific one right now\nso I don't want to commit to one yeah um\nquite yet\nbut I think that I think they're good to\nunderstand like what the cloud provider\nexpects or\num\nwhat the cloud providers uh based on\nexpectation of security is\num and also like just things you don't\nknow right so like you know if I were to\nstudy for a class security certification\nnow I would definitely learn things a\nlot of things I didn't know about like\nSecurity in the cloud environments right\na lot of things that I know about\nsecurity Now is just like really like\npatched knowledge you know across like\narticles or books or like YouTube videos\nor courses I've taken over time or just\nlike general knowledge um but like it\nwould give you like a Consolidated like\na Consolidated\num\nframework for learning these different\nthings right but it might not go in in\ndepth into other things that might be\nCloud security related for these\ndifferent certifications I do think\nthey're valuable to learn\num you know and get like just get an\nunderstanding of like what should\nsecurity look like in this environment\num you know\num but I I really can't speak to them\nmuch I I wish\num and I hope that in the future that\nthey are a lot more practical yeah um I\nwould matter of fact the entire Suite of\ncloud certifications because I think\nthat's a very huge value proposition for\nhaving practical Cloud certifications\nbecause\nthe skills to work in Cloud are\npractical\num um and I think like the one I\nrecently did for like the Azure one like\nit's practical you're exploiting\nvulnerabilities in Azure environments\nand stuff like that so\num I that's kind of my thought on them I\nreally can't say much because I haven't\ndone any of them yeah um if I've done\none or you know a couple of them I would\nbe able to say a lot more about them but\nI do think you know it also depends on\nlike the individual right so like you\nknow if you're working in the AWS\nCentric environment or like a gcp or\nAzure septic environment you know it\nmight be valuable to like you know you\nknow take to study for a certification\ntake it if you want to to kind of\nunderstand like you know what should I\nbe what should I know in terms of\nsecurity\num for for my environment at least from\nthe perspective of the cloud provider\num so that that's kind of my opinion\nabout them I do think though at the\nentry level I don't think like if you\nwant to do Cloud security you should be\ngoing for any of those certifications\nquite yet yeah you should probably focus\non like the architectural and like\nadministrative ones first\num and then once you understand those\ncomponents then go for the security ones\neventually\num but there's also like a a good amount\nof like class security Labs out there as\nwell that\num you would uh that would help you\nunderstand certain things so my opinion\nis like kind of all the way to the place\nabout it no I feel you so\nI get what you're saying where like the\ntwo certifications that you mentioned\nfor anyone trying to get their their\nfoot in the door for an insecurity makes\nmore sense and then once you kind of\nfind yourself working in a specific\nenvironment then probably go and\nspecialize but I think you know with\nsecurity it definitely is beneficial\nhaving like an overview of how Cloud\nworks so doing like an associate level\nAWS Azure or gcp certification I think\nwould be a nice bonus there in the same\nway I say this other the way or other\nway around like if you're in a cloud\nspace and this is what just which is why\nI asked you to write phase five of like\nlearn a cloud like Cloud security\nfundamentals like having an idea of how\nlike security works in the cloud is\nalways going to be even beneficial no\nmatter like what like if you're Cloud\ndeveloper Cloud admin Cloud support\nengineer whatever it is that you're\ntrying to like work it's like\nyeah it's all still it's all Cloud\nbecause like you're either if you're\nadministrating it you're securing it\nwhatever you're still in the cloud so\nhaving an idea of it but the\nspecialization\ncomes like later like get your foot in\nthe door I would say for sure but like I\nlike I like that advice\num I wanna so\nlet's take a pause here because someone\nmade\nsomeone made a comment that you were\ngetting job offers before graduating but\nno that's I mean that is the case but\nit's also like you work\nas you're in the security space you work\nin this security space before graduating\nlike when you graduate do you know yet\nso that's kind of like a sad story but\num I I I am hoping and praying to walk\nacross the stage next month\num I had a little bit of a setback yeah\nlast night after one of my classes\num which one can you tell me it's it's a\nweb development class all right all\nright yeah\num but I I'm still like um I'm still\ntrusting that I I could still do it yeah\num so I'm working towards it\num so hopefully uh next month how are\nyou balancing man like school YouTube\num and like let's just say content\nbecause it's not just YouTube work and\nthen you're also like a freaking machine\nin the gym like and you know and you\nhave a social life like I know you\nyou're trying to underplay it but you do\nhave a social like like I see you you\nwere you were traveling a bit over the\nsummer you know over right that was that\nwas work though that was like all of it\nwas I love it was worth it but it still\ncounts\nit still counts though so like how how\nare you balancing that and um because\nthen I want to talk to you a little bit\nabout like like social media and like\nmonk mode but I want to first ask you\nabout these work-life balance because a\nlot of times people find themselves\nyou know trying to get into Tech\nwhatever space it is and they have\nfull-time jobs they have families and\nwhatnot so like do you have any tips on\nbalancing that stuff in generalum soI would say like I think we kind of also\ncovered this in like the last time we\nspoke yeah um I'm gonna have a little I\nmight have a little bit more to say um\nnow but I would say like it starts it\nstarts with like like prioritization\num like first of all like what what is\nlike important for you to you at this\npoint in time right for me like the\nimportant things to me right now are\nSchool\nwork\nmy tutoring job I forgot you do that too\noh my goshthat's ridiculous\nall right but you know just like first\nof all certain priorities right so\nschool work tutoring job gym and uh so\nyeah school work the tutoring job\nthe school work and a tutoring job are\nmy main priorities right so work that's\nmy career that gives me experience and\npays the bills in school I just it's out\nof necessity\num and my tutoring job also like it's\njust my passion right yeah those are my\nthree my top three priorities right so\nthose ones like take precedence over\neverything right so like every day\num those are top of mind then next is\ntwo things working out at the gym right\nworking out and sleep right\num oh my god let's go let's go all right\nyeah so working out keeps me sane um and\njust like you're just like keeping me\nhealthy like you know I spend a lot of\ntime sitting down for my computer like\nyeah it definitely need to like you know\nget my back straight and all that so\nlike just making sure like you know I'm\ndoing that and also like it just keeps\nme saying like just keeps me like\num like just keep pushing like you know\njust having that mindset I just like\nfreaking blasting like rap music in the\ngym at like 11 p.m in the night like\njust really like I need your playlist\nman do you use SpotifyI mean like apple music like is not\nperfect\num the only thing not perfect about it\nis like this the shuffle but it just it\njust does it for me um so all right all\nright it's right because I also use\napple music but I only use it because my\nbrother sends me tracks to like shares\nstuff there but I use Spotify because\nlike the random playlist on Spotify I\nlove them yes but anyway I agree so\nyou're talking about priorities but also\nyou have this you're all right for just\ncontext for people that joins after day\nis 20 years old he works as a what is a\ndetection engineer detection engineer at\ndatadog currently a student a teacher a\nYouTuber\na family person or a family member we\ncan say\num I probably missed something too like\nhe's super fit dude you're like I I keep\nup with your products with Jim too\nstupid fit dude and you you've done all\nof this and now obviously now you're\nhanging out here with me by the age of\n20 in mindset and you're talking about\npriorities and whatnot but how does one\nhow do you get there that's that's what\nlike because like I feel like we have\nvery similar mindsets but I'm 28 right\nI'm like you know getting closer to 30.\nat 20 dude at 20 I was like I was a\ncomplete idiot like there's no way I\ncould have ever thought the way like you\ncan't catch me at 20 being like oh you\nknow what sleep sleep's important\nso how does like like tell me like where\nwhere did this this come from or were\nyou always like this or like did\nsomething happen you were like you know\nwhat I gotta change my life or something\nlike that\nI mean I guess like so I\num like I'd say like\n[Music]\num\nfrom from childhood I've I've kind of\nalways been like\nserious about life right like I've\nalways been the guy that's like you know\neveryone's like oh you know\num you know let's do this let's do that\nI'm like oh like you know let's not do\nthat like you know like touching always\ncould be this could have some\nconsequences I've always been that kid\nthat's just like just a serious kid\nright I'm always like that person like\nI'm the one who like\nI don't want to say like I don't like as\na kid I'll be the person that like you\nknow everybody wants to go like do bad\nstuff and I'm like oh you guys don't do\nthat like that right so like I'm just\ngonna have I'm just kind of always being\nlike you know I guess like the good kid\nlike in that sense right yeah um but\nlike that doesn't another thing is also\nlike\num I guess the family I come from right\nso like\num you know like my dad like is a very\nlike he's a very interesting person\num like uh you know he he used to read a\nlot I definitely took that from him\num and like he's also like a obviously a\nserious person it's like and it was also\nsomeone I used to like aspire to be like\nright I had a lot of traits from him so\nlike I I do I do have a lot of traits\nfor my dad that I um sometimes I don't\neven realize like um you know but like\nit definitely I guess it was definitely\nsomething I grew up with and then you\nknow\num in 20 20 2019 no 20 2020\num was like kind of like the like a\nbreaking point for me um 2019 2020\num so like 2019 uh I had like a car\ncrash\num so like first time I I ever had any\nlike severe thing happen to me right um\nthis is me like if I ever talked about\nthis I guess I guess I guess today's the\nday\num I wasn't gonna stop you so good so I\nhad a car crash um and like it just\ncompletely changed my life so yeah uh\nwhat happened was um you know was it my\nfault um you know got here from behind\nfrom\num person wasn't paying attention\num so like what happened was this was\nlike freshman year of college like first\nsemester\num like my my left hand like tore open\nright here yeah it's still healing till\nnow\num and like you know my car got totaled\nyou know everything was just like\neverything just went downhill right\num like and so you know I my car got\ntotaled\num so I could I couldn't like you know\ndrive to work so I lost my job\num then I I failed my I failed one of my\nclasses in college there's this girl I\nliked I was talking to that time like\nshe kind of dumped me I don't know what\nhappened yeah like\numthat wasn't even like it wasn't even a\nheartbreak I would say like because\nwe're even dating right so like that was\nlike phase one right and then phase two\nwas like I just like sunk into\ndepression like this is like a period I\nwas just like like depression just like\nall the way down into that hole all\nright um and then like that was and that\nwas towards the end of 2019 then in 2020\nlike\num I got into another uh uh relationship\nand then like\num that also went downhill right so like\nthis was me trying to like fill the\nwhole of depression like by you know\ntrying to like get into a relationship\nor like do things that would like all\nright you know you know pluck that hole\nso\num but like I just and this is also the\nfirst time this was I know this was the\nperiod when I feel the a plus for the\nfirst time oh my God so like not the a\nplus that'll do it\nyeah every possible bad thing that could\nhappen like happened between like\nOctober of 2019 and like\nFeb like February March April of 2020\num so like this was appeared as like\nyeah like I have to like reset and then\nlike once that I recent happened like\nyou know like just like\num like like just you know we're\ncalibrating the money and everything\nlike then you know things just happens\nto happen like\num on like continuously right so good\nthings started happening like really\ncontinuously right and that's also when\nlike the self-improvement journey began\nlike my self-improvement journey like\nbegan at the same time that my like\ncareer Journey began so look at that\nit's just been like working at the same\ntime so like I'm still on the journey\nlike you know like I have a lot of\nlearning to do yeah to do but like I've\npicked up a lot you know another thing\nthat you know I you know I've been doing\na lot is just like you know watching\ncontent from you know YouTube or like um\nfor one people that\num kind of you know have certain\nmindsets that I embody yeah within books\nas well like books have definitely\nhelped me like with my knowledge um and\nlike the good thing the thing about good\nknowledge and like um you know having\ncertain mindset and like\nself-development is like it's like a\nit's a huge world and like the dots just\nconnect like all over the place like\nit's like once once you learn something\nnew what's like a new video read a new\nbook like the the dots just keep\nconnecting and like the dots connect\neverywhere we're like to connect in your\ncareer to connect in like your like your\nphysical life going to the gym or to\nconnect and you're like your emotional\nlife your everything like that so like\nthat's kind of how it happened\num you know like every like I I just I\nthat was just kind of like the Turning\nPoint\num and it just like kept me on like you\nknow trying to like apply all the things\nI've been learning um both like in my\ncareer and like in life in general it's\njust like bring everything together\nbecause like it's a whole it's a\ncohesive life yeah yeah everything about\neverything everything that I do is like\nmy identity and like everything that I\nthat um that I learned from you know all\nmy experiences apply to everything so\nthat's kind of how I became um day\ntalking about sleep there's this saying\nthat I this quote that I like a lot\nthat's called how you do anything is how\nyou do everything\num and I I feel like you sort of embody\nthat because\nyou're you're very detailed and very\nlike you should work really hard and I I\ncan tell because like I follow like ever\nsince I met you well before not meeting\nyou in person but new of you I was like\noh like I know he's putting it putting\nin the work and like you know that's\nwhere that's why you're at where you're\nat now\nand\nI wanted to talk to you about WGU\nbecause this is another big part of like\nyour student you're like you're doing\nthis while working full time\nuh which takes a lot of like\nI was like I remember I was on you I\nthink I was on your Discord\nand I was like man I want to go to WGU\num I want like to to for my contacts I\nhave like two semesters in computer\nscience so like I you know and whatnot\nand I have like work experience and\nwhatnot and like WGU can use that as\ncredits like towards like completing\nyour your program which I think is\nawesome\num a lot of like local community college\nwould be like no you gotta start from\nzero and that's always been for me like\nI don't want to start from zero yeah but\nI remember putting in your Discord like\nman I wanna I wanna do this but I don't\nhave time and you replied with something\nthat just kind of stuck with me it's\nlike just do it like the time will make\nitselfI was like damn it Dave why are you\ntelling me the truth I don't want to\nhear that right now but no I wanna I\nwanna talk to you about WGU because I've\nlooked at it a couple of times I looked\nat it before the cloud program had\nlike different tracks and then I think\nearlier this year someone told me like\nWGU has different Cloud tracks whatnot\nand I was like all right now this looks\nlike especially the Azure one to me\nobviously because that's like my\necosystem what not like and now I'm like\nthis looks now it looks like oh I really\nneed to do this but I want to talk I\nwant to like know about like why you\npicked WGU what's your experience been\ndo you recommend it for people who are\nlooking into like going to college like\nyou I know you've done a couple\ndifferent programs and uh you're in like\nyou're not in the same one that you\nstarted in right now so like talk to me\na little bit about WGU all right so um\nalso for context I have changed my major\nin the last three years like five times\nmy fifth major which you can do in WGU\nwhich is great yeah yeah so\num so starting with like why I chose WGU\num so I finished my I didn't finish but\nlike I was about to finish my community\ncollege program last year\num so that was like after two years\nright\num and this is after trading my major\nlike two or three times because what\nhappened was I you know got my\ninternship right after like like right\nbefore the freshman year and so like I\nstarted working\num and I was like okay like these\nclasses are no longer making any sense\nlike they don't I not I'm not trying to\nsound like proud web I'm above this like\nI already have the experience like um it\ndoesn't it wasn't making any sense to\nlike go credit go get credit for that\nanymore yeah like the credit I I need is\nlike in the experience I'm really\nbuilding so\num I was like okay I'm gonna just shift\nswitch to from cyber security to general\neducation like just a general Bachelors\nof\num arts or science right no major\nspecifically\num and then\num you know I finished it I finished it\nbut I had like two classes last I was\nlike I told my mom I was like I don't I\ndon't I don't care about the associates\ndegree all I care about is bachelor's\ndegree which is what you care about so I\ndon't need to finish these classes let\nme just transfer these classes into WGU\nbecause\nWGU\ndoes not require me to come with classes\nuh WWE accept all my most of my\ncertifications right so like\num all the a plus never plots all of\nthose certifications they transferred\ninto the degree program also my credits\nfrom the Community College transfer as\nwell and it gives me the flexibility to\nlike continue my career as I I had been\non that trajectory right because I was\nalready working full-time at this point\nlike I was like there's no way I can do\na a regular four-year program like I'm\nnot going to be in campus like trying to\nlike work at the same time like yeah\nyeah like so\num I so I just went I decided to go to\nWGU so like the flexibility of like\ndoing that and also you also don't have\nto like like if you know if you\nunderstand the concepts in the class you\ndon't have to like you know wait for\nlike you know till the end of the\nsemester you can immediately test out of\nthe class right like literally like I I\nI love that about the school is so\nfreaking so freaking out absolutely\nlet's give a little context WGU first\nfor because we just keep saying it and\nlike we haven't given context so WGU is\nWestern Governors University it's an\naccredited University here in the US and\nit's comp Competency Based so you take\nyou pick up classes but if you feel like\nyou already know you can test out of\nthem like almost right away right yes\nyou can you take the exam and if you\npass whatever it is like the requirement\nyou think that class is essentially\nchecked off and it's it's like very like\num sort of like popular with I think a\nlot of like I.T folks but people like\nwho are already in careers and whatnot\nbecause they've learned a lot of skills\ngained certifications and whatnot at\ntheir roles and they want to be able to\nbring those in and make those count as\ncredit and WGU is one of the few schools\nthat actually does that they'll take\nyour experience they'll take your uh\ncertifications and be like all right you\nknow what you don't need to do these\nclasses these classes are all checked\noff to finish your degree and turn a\nbachelor's in like there's a bunch of\ndifferent programs I know those are\nsecurity there's cloud with different\ntracks there's like um a very like\nGeneral like BS and I.T there's there's\nlike I think there's like healthcare\nstuff there's like business stuff\nthere's a whole bunch of other things\nlike\num and that's I first came across it\nmaybe three four years ago and I was\nlike this is interesting but because\nwork was just like what I wanted to\nfigure out at that time now where I'm\nlike my career is pretty much like I'm\nat the company that I want to be at at\nthe moment I'm in the role that I want\nto be at now I have a little bit more\nlike headspace to kind of like dive into\neducation which is why I've been like\nthinking about it and you're like the\nclosest person I know who's doing it and\nI just love like like you you post your\nprogress often too and I'm like oh man\nthis guy's almost gonna graduate which I\nlove but I just think like having a\nschool like that here is\nit's just it's a different way of\nlearning and it's a different way to\nhave like a university but I feel like\nit's just more universities need to\nadopt this model because yes like you\nalso posted like\nyou you dislike having to do these\nclasses that are just not relevant and\nso many University programs are like\npacked with so many classes that are not\nrelevant so do you wanna do you wanna\nlike maybe talk about like\nyeah you see you you mentioned about\nswitching your majors and whatnot uh so\nwhat's like your mindset now you want to\njust want you want to get done with it\nand you're like you're out\nyeah so like right now so like yeah\nthat's that's my mindset initially was\nlike oh I could just like you know\nslowly just like chop at this right you\nknow um alongside work um but now\nit it was getting to the point where\nlike I so I I took so I took a six month\nbreak when I you know I was interviewing\nearlier in this year so I was\ninterviewing with AWS and did a dog\neither this year so like I was like\nthere's no way I can combine this with\nschool um especially studying for those\ninterviews yeah um and then when I\nstarted I did a dog I was like\num I need to like get situated in here\nbefore I get back into school so I took\na whole six month break and then when I\ngot back as I was about to get back I\nwas like I cannot continue with the\ncloud program because it would just take\nme too long because I would have to do\nall of those certifications and I know I\ncan pick those certifications as I want\nto over my career they're not a pressing\nconcern for me right now like I have\nother priorities which points back to my\ninitial point of priorities\num so I was like the easiest program for\nme to finish right now no excessive math\nrequirements because I don't really like\nmath and no excessive uh certifications\nis the IT program which is what I\neventually settled on and I'm actually\nalmost done I just I literally have just\ntwo classes left yeah\num so like that's that's my mindset I\nwas like I just want to just like get\nthis and have have it you know now that\nI can right because it's like\num I could just like be like Oh I'm I'm\nlike I'm 20 I have my career all set for\nme I don't need a degree but of course\nthat is true but it's like at the same\ntime it's like I don't want to like then\ncome back you know no offense to you\nlike and be like 28 and be like oh maybe\nI want to you know go back and just like\nyou know get this degree done yeah right\nnow I still have\nyeah I mean like right now I still have\nthe energy and like you know I still\nhave the willpower to want to pursue it\nyeah\num now so like might as well just like\nyou know you know just Thug it out and\njust like get it done\num that I can so that's kind of like my\nmindset around there right now because\nI'm I'll have it and I'll have it\nforever so yeah I feel yeah I think\nthat is\nI don't think I regret not going\nfinishing at the time that I could\nfinish because I dropped out for like a\nbunch of other reasons but it is\nsomething that is always in the back of\nmy mind definitely\nuh it is always like ah should I do it\nshould I not and have I had it done and\nout of the way it would just not not\nbother me and I can't like you said I\ncan feel like oh I'm set I got my career\nall set whatever like I don't have to\ncare about it but\nI just don't think that way I think I'm\nalways like what can I do better to like\nlike to like upscale and whatnot\num and also like parents\nmy parent my mom is still like yeah I\nknow you're gonna go back one day I\ncould be like 60 and my mom would be\nlike I know you're gonna do this and\nyou're gonna graduate you're gonna bring\nme that diploma so it's another like\npressure that I have too for that if\nthat is actually something that matters\nor I don't know what but I just like to\nbe able to see them have like that sense\nof Pride because it's something that you\nyou will accomplish and now I might\naccomplish I think also plays a big\nimpact\num yeah but yeah no I I was like I'm\nalways just in awe like how you do it\nhow like how you handle it all for and\nsomeone asked here can\nWGU be done remotely like yeah it's all\nit's all online but it's only in the US\nright\nyes um I uh as far as I know they don't\num do it International\nyes I think\nthere was some talks about them\nextending their program at some point to\nCanada but none of that is official\num but yeah it's all\nit's all online which is fantastic\num absolutely yeah man yeah so we're at\nabout an hour I want to dive into like\npeople's questions uh because we talked\na lot about you and and and whatnot and\nwhen you're in New York we'll have to do\nanother catch-up again uh for sure and\nwhatnot but like let's I'm gonna take\nsome time to to go through these\nquestions and just see but someone was\nasking about cyber security boot camps\nand if we make that like a higher level\nup how do you feel about boot camps in\ngeneral\num\nI think they're well intentioned\nby something I think you sound like\nyou're media trained\nuh but I don't think they I don't think\nthey always served a value that um you\nknow they uh they should\num there is one though that I can speak\nspeak to because I do know someone who I\nrespect and who went through the program\nand is doing very well in the career\num and I you know by proxy would\nrecommend it so this is not an\nendorsement it's only a recommendation\num it's called level effect\num and like it's um it's actually like\nyou know what I like very like practical\nand all that so if you would want to\nconsider that I would say go that route\ngo like take a look at it but I do think\nthat um again it's there's also the\ntrade-off right it's like there's a\ntrade-off of you know the effort and\nenergy and\nlooking for resources to learn on your\nown\num versus having a curated uh curated\nresources from The Bootcamp and access\nto people you know if you have questions\nstuff like that if you're doing like the\nself-study thing like you kind of have\nto look for that on your own yeah yeah\nenjoy communities asking Twitter Reddit\nDiscord all of that and not everyone is\nalways helpful but like you know if\nyou're paying for that service or the\nboot camp like it's kind of is an\nexpectation that you get that help that\nyou need yeah um as you're learning so\nthat's the only one I would recommend\nnot endorse um I definitely would check\nit out if you're looking to go that way\nI do think you can still go this journey\nlike learning on your own and it's very\nvaluable as well yeah I I share a very\nsimilar opinion on boot camps I I just\ndon't endorse or recommend any because I\nthink on average the cloud ones are\nanywhere from like 15 to 20 000 you're\ntalking about like a couple months to\nlike a year and program and like how\nmuch time you're spending and whatnot\nand I think with that amount of money\nand that amount of time with way less\nmoney you can teach yourself absolutely\neverything that you need to teach\nyourself you get your account in Azure\nor in Google or gcp or AWS and whatnot\nand with significantly less amount of\nmoney but also what you're learning is\nyou're learning how to learn which in 20\nyears or like let's not say 20 years\nlet's say like in five years when you\nneed to learn something else for your\njob are you going to go to a boot camp\nagain no you need to know how to teach\nyourself these things you need to know\nhow to find answers you need to know how\nto ask questions and the earlier you do\nthat in your career the better it is for\nyou don't get me wrong some people do\nneed like guided learning and whatnot\nbut I just think\nyou I I really do feel like people\nshould exhaust absolutely every single\nself-taught method whether that be a\ncourse like a video course books\ndocumentation YouTube whatever it is\nfirst and like really try to get and\nunderstand how people how you learn\nfirst and then if none of that works for\nwhatever reason then like okay look into\nlike guided stuff like boot camps and\none but like\nI don't think it should be People's\nFirst\ndecision and I also feel like boot camps\ntake advantage of like oh go to our boot\ncamp and we'll get you a job like job\nguarantee and it's like and there's been\nso much news out there about like how\nthese promises are frauds they're fake\nso and I don't like seeing people really\ntake advantage of either\num so we share a similar a similar\nopinion there um\nsomeone asks us about any cyber security\nroles that you're doing programming as\nwell\ncyber security was that you're doing\nprogramming yeah\nlike programming a lot day to day\nyeah so\num there are definitely roles like that\num you knowso\num a lot of roles like\num especially like higher level ones\num in like security engineering like\nrequire a little like automation\nscripting\num so you're not necessarily like\nbuilding a loud software yeah like a\nsoftware engineer you're more so like\njust like automating tasks um script and\nstuff like that or maybe even maybe like\nfinding bugs in code\num so like you know might have to do\nlike a lot of data like python or go\num even\num some rules that are not necessarily\nlike that way maybe like you might have\nto write scripts to like you know for\nlike validation or like for like\num GitHub hook hooks or like commit\nchecks like all those things like being\nable to like write you know scripts for\nthat um definitely is valuable\num and yeah when you when you start\ngetting into like security engineering\nlike that program is like really\num beneficial which is kind of why I'm\ndedicating like the entire like first\nsix months to make sure that\num for learning python um so like python\npython and go are you know typically\nlike de facto these days yeah\num for like security\net cetera going to like more like lower\nlevel stuff or like malware analysis or\nlike export development that's when\nyou're doing like C plus plus C shakes\nof those things so um yeah that's kind\nof yeah but it's definitely like if you\nwant to like if you wanna if you wanna\nbetter your chances of being as a cyber\nsecurity candidate like definitely like\nyou know have like a at least like a\nscripted language like python under your\nbelt like it definitely would be very\nhelpful and gives you more opportunities\nfor a career advancement\nall right dope so people automation\npython go cool yes uh let me see yeah\npeople were like talking throughout this\nwhole thing which is great uh let's seewhat's harder to get a job in cyber\nsecurity or cloud\nhuh\nI'll say cyber security yeah I would say\ncyber security as well\num entry leveluh yeah yeah I would probably say cyber\nsecurity just because there'sjust because the certifications alone\nare tougherI also think like expectations are\nhigher\nfor the can like candidates coming into\nbrawls for entry level roasting cyber\nsecurity yeah\nI haven't looked we should do some some\nkind of collab video on comparing\ni j I do agree that it's more difficult\nI just think because\nit's not like I don't I still feel like\nsecurity is still like a space that a\nlittle bit\ngate gate kept like gatekeeping still\naround like everyone who I know in\nsecurity is just like super professional\nsuper senior and I don't see a lot of\nthese entry-level like roles or people\nin these roles that talk about it I feel\nlike that is starting to change a little\nbit\num but I would also I would agree that\nit's probably hard against cyber\nsecurity just because it's like it's\nalready like a niche in a way oh yeah\nlike Cloud can be like super General and\nthen you have Cloud security that's like\na niche yeah um so I would say like yeah\nit's it's\nit would be more difficult but speaking\nabout like requirements or expectations\nlike what are like entry-level skill set\nsecurity roles like sock analysts are\nexpected to know\num definitely like a strong\nunderstanding of networking\num that's like\nthat's\num you know that's very important\num specifically it's like speaking for\nstock analysis right so strong\nunderstanding of networking\num General understanding of like you\nknow\npopular security attacks right\num also like like if you if if\num requirements if if you if you want to\nmeet the requirements right\num like definitely have those skills and\nalso like you know log analysis right\num like using like a Sim or like a you\nknow a log analysis tool like that\ndefinitely understanding that is\nimportant because like some of these\ntools have like their query languages\nlike Splunk has like the SPL\num I know like Sentinel uses kqr right\nso like if you if you kind of have\nunderstanding of one like it's a lot\neasier to kind of like apply that\nknowledge to like querying other\num um a Sim tools so like definitely\nlike getting your hands dirty with that\num then understanding of like\nactive directory like a lot of\nenvironments are like very active\nthey're actually like focused\num so definitely understand like how\nactive directory works like your Windows\nEvent codes like that's definitely a\ngood one to like kind of know some of\nthem I mean of course you'd have to\nmemorize them but like it's going to\nknow you know some of them um and also\nlike maybe a little bit of cloud some\nenvironment most a lot of environments\nnow are like you know hybrid or like\nfully Cloud environment so like just\nkind of understand like you know these\ndifferent things in cloud like like\nbasic uh Cloud\num uh security issues or concepts um and\nthis is me this is me as a fair person\nthat I think are like these are the\nrequirements I think should be for uh\nyeah\na lot of times they're not necessarily\nthis way\num they're definitely having like you\nknow maybe like two or three\ncertifications under your belt\num you know a couple projects um but the\nbiggest thing the biggest thing the\nbiggest thing I can I can put you\nthrough is like networking like get your\nname out there or like just get your\nname out there on Twitter LinkedIn do\nprojects\num yeah like projects are like one of\nthe biggest ways do blogs oh I wanted to\nspeak speak about projects your home lab\ntime to talk a little bit about it\nand because I made a big impact on on\nyour career right yeah uh absolutely\nabsolutely\num yeah till this day like I like like\nliterally on Twitter like\num somebody like referenced it\num\num on like a like a Blog about like Trey\nhunting and stuff like that and I was\nlike wow like it's still relevant to\nthis day you know in such a context like\nthat so and it's still it's still it's\nstill like this is one of my biggest\nflakes let's do number one on Google\nsearch for cyber security home lab like\ntill this day for over a year everyone\ngo Google cyber security home lab and\nthen you're gonna know what we're\ntalking about yeah like it's still\nnumber one I don't even support you\nanymore because like a lot of the\ncontent there's uh\num outdated but but\num there might be a update coming uh\nnext year I'll have a little\nannouncements coming next year so like\ndefinitely keep an eye out um like this\nit's gonna be it's gonna be next level\nbut um\num fingers crossed on that you know\ngonna do like a paid version or\nsomething\num no this one is going to be free but\nthere are certain things you're gonna\nhave to pay for interesting interesting\nall right all right I see\ncan you talk a little bit about like so\nyou did you just sit down one day and\nyou're like I'm gonna make a home lab\nlike how did that happen um no this was\nthis was this was months yeah this took\nmonths so I I actually had an initial\none that's that failed\num so um I started a series this was\nlike in late 2020\num and it was blogger YouTuber War on\nYouTube\num it was it was initially on YouTube\num and I was following this guide I\nstill have the book um but it didn't go\nit wasn't like a lot of the things I was\ntrying to do weren't working well and it\nwas because I was like kind of following\nthe book to the T\num so I was like no this is like it this\nthe the goal of this was to help me\nbuild a home lab but like\nI wanted something different\num maybe a little something a little bit\nmore original so like okay I'm gonna go\ngo out there and learn about all these\ndifferent pieces because like it's\nthere's different pieces of that lab\nright if you look at the architecture\nwhich is like on the first page like\njust different things are interconnected\nlike it's they're very intricate things\nthat you need to know to build that to\nand also configure the networking for\nthat lab which is also why I I'm picking\nnetworking so\num you know um it took me like three or\nfour months because I had to do it a\nbunch of times I had to do it first like\nbring all the pieces together get it to\nwork and I have to do it again for the\nblog so like to actually you know get\nout the pro step by step for the blog\nand then the third time for the video\nseries so like yeah you knew that in and\nout no like yeah 100 like and that's\npart of why I I also was doing support\nfor it so like if you do if on the home\nlab there was like a link to my Discord\nif you had any issues with the lab I\nwould personally support you with like\nyou know fixing issues troubleshooting I\ndid that for about a year yeah I just\nbecame unsustainable yeah um for me\num and also like a little stuff got\noutdated but I learned a lot from that\nlike it like it taught me a lot about\nlike different things like in different\nlike the configuration of those\ndifferent things\num setting it up and also like using it\non my own like one thing people wanted\nme to do was show them how to use the\nlab I was like what I already did in\nthis lab is like enough like if I were\nto start a whole series of like how to\ndo this and do that like you know that\nthat'll probably all be uh sustainable\num but like it definitely taught me a\nlot it helped me a lot with my\ninterviews\num and also like kind of is I guess\nplays a weird story into like how I've\nactually got my data Dog Job indirectly\num like\num like it definitely like put a huge\nrole like entirely So like\num I definitely owe a lot of my\num you know my clout and My Success\num to that to that project so I think\nthe concept of like building a like a\ncore project where you kind of just\napply everything that you're learning\nbut also like as you learn something\nelse you can apply to it as well like\nfor Azure there's\na project called the Azure pet store\nwhich is like a colleague of mine he was\nstudying for the az204 certification and\nhe had no idea about his his past\nexperience was in a different Cloud so\nhe came and joined Microsoft and then he\nwas studying for that certification he's\nlike I need to like put this into like\nsomething practical so he built this the\nset of 19 Labs called the Azure pet\nstore and like\nand whenever he learned something new he\njust finds a new feature to add to it so\nthere's like there's kubernetes there's\ncontainers there's serverless there's uh\nno code low code there's Azure devops\nthere's GitHub there's Kiva there's uh\nactive directory there's a whole bunch\nof things in that and he kind of just\nkeeps adding to it and updating it as he\nwants to so I'm working on something\nlike that for myself as well but mainly\njust to learn but I think you know now\nhaving all the tools that you can do\nthese stuff like on your own machine you\nhave your own account and like create\nthese things or like in the cloud and\nwhatnot it's like so doable for people\nthat go out and just create these things\nand like just hack on it every single\nday and like if you get failures and\nwhatnot like that's fine because it's\nlike not production level like this\nisn't like you're not like running like\nInstagram servers or anything like that\nand you learned a lot from like\ntroubleshooting like the skills you\nlearn from like troubleshooters are so\nvaluable like even like when you get\ninto the like actual job like you're\ngonna run into like a bunch of Errors\nlike you're gonna run into like a bunch\nof issues like the things you're not\nfamiliar with so the skill you learn\nfrom like you know researching how to\nlike you know solve issues like you know\ngoing to a stack Overflow and yeah you\nknow looking at error codes and stuff\nlike that like those things are very\nvaluable so like you know you'll\ndefinitely learn a lot from that I do\nwant to do something like that again\nnext year\num but I'm I'm gonna so my plan is to\nrevamp this one to a more updated\nversion like really spiff it up\num make it more updated updated I'm\ngonna do a bunch of other ones\num for cloud\num but these are going to be like a\nlittle bit more advanced but\num more on that in the future all right\neveryone needs to like I put your links\nin the chat\num for everyone to like keep updated\nwith like\nlike your your social medias I wanna but\nlike what's so what's the focus for the\nrest of you I just finished school and\nlike keep doing YouTube you took a break\nfrom YouTube though like are you back\nI'm sort of back on um I took like a\ntwo-month break but I'm sort of back on\nright now\num I might have to like take a a slide\nbreak again just after like just you\nknow uh find out this rest of school\nstuff but I'm kind of back on that I'm\nprobably gonna like maybe just keep up\nthe\nshort film content I recycle the ones\nfrom Instagram to YouTube oh okay and\num maybe do like like I like there's\nthere's there's some videos of viewers\nthat I like like you just do like these\nquick two or three minute videos with\nlike very short and succinct content\nanswering like a very specific question\nand like I probably would do like a\ncouple of doubts because like there are\nsome things I don't necessarily require\nlike 10 minute 12 minute videos like you\ncould just do like a One-Shot video\ncovering something so I might do like um\nsome of those for some things I've had\nI've had like lined up yeah um at the\nsame time though\num I do have this crazy thing in my head\nwhereby I know that if I'm consistent\nenough\nand I keep the quality I could get a 20K\nsubscribers at the end of the year oh\nheck yeah yeah easy so I'm thinking of\nlike keeping the consistency so like\nit's kind of like it's kind of somewhere\nin the middle but we'll see no I feel\nyou\nall right man well we've been doing this\nhour 20 we answered I feel like well we\ndidn't answer that much but I feel like\nthe conversation has a lot that people\ncan go back to I'll make sure to have\nuh I have an editor now he's gonna go\nback and add all these time stamps yeah\nso I don't have to worry about that but\nI think all the questions that they\nanswered will be in time sense so you\ncan watch your recording uh man I I\nappreciate you it's always such a good\ngood time to sit down and talk to you\nand like always keep up to you because\nyou're like one of the realest person\npeople there like you don't you're not\nout here like selling people dreams\nyou're not out here like you know lying\nor whatnot you're like being honest like\nyour last video about like\nyo this stuff takes like it like sucks\nit like sucks like there's a lot of work\nthat you got to put in sucks and you\ndon't just show up like and then you\nmake it you after you make it you gotta\nshow up you run harder like that's just\nlike that's just the reality here's the\nlast question someone asked I don't know\nif you've done a video on this are you\ncomfortable answering this question\nhow much your salary is at the moment uh\nI'm not ready for that conversation yet\nyou want to give a range a range arrange\nyeah\num arrange no I'm not no six figures six\nfigures is good enough okay six figures\nall right people he makes six figures 20\nyears old making six figures\nthat's dude you're living a good life\nman\nyou're living a good life for sure I'm\nstill not in my final form yet though oh\nyeah I mean but this is where this is\nessentially where you you kind of got\nlike your first solid step right that's\nnot how you feel and this is your first\nsolid step 20 years old can't even drink\nbut you're making six figures and you\nand you care about sleep like I think\nyou're I think you're ahead of you know\ninto good into good space and whatnot\nbut um for me like there's plenty of\nvideos on like money stuff and I have a\nvideo coming out on Wednesday about how\nI spend my monthly so I go over like how\nmuch I save how much I invest how much I\npay for this how much I pay for that and\nkind of like books that I've used and\nwhatnot\num so that'll be on my channel on\nWednesday but I've had a I've talked\nabout this a lot yeah so people I find\nthat I I I'm definitely an advocate for\nsalary transparency um I do have those\nconversations with like people in my my\ncircles so like of course like you know\nlike you know my friends know stuff like\nthat\num but like it's uh I'm not at the point\nwhere I'm really ready to give out that\ninformation to the world yeah um but\neventually maybe like next year like the\nyear after that\num I'll be a lot more transparent about\nthat to the world no I feel you I feel\nyou I it's\nit definitely opens especially with\npublicly and especially being at a\ncompany where that has a lot of clout it\ncan open you to up to a lot of like\njust other people's opinions that could\npotentially impact like your team\nRapport that could impact like I don't\nknow a bunch of other things and I knew\nbefore making any of the videos that I\ndid where I spoke about salary like I\nknew that was like the potential but\nthen at the end of the day like if you\nlook at everything that I've put into\nlike my career like the amount of money\nthe raises the promotions is all\nlike\nwell well deserved so if anyone ever\ncame at me and was like well why does\nshe make this much and I didn't I would\nbe like well like look at my track\nrecord right like it's all like\ndocumented here like are you working 14\nhours a day are you making videos every\nsingle week for two years are you\nstreaming additionally on top of all\nyour like your you know day to day like\nyou're not so like\nI mean yeah and those things have\nhappened which I think is um\nit's you know it just is but like all\nyou can do is kind of like set a good\nexample but it it's I wouldn't have done\nit like\na year ago for sure now but like now\nwhere I'm at like whatever dude yeah\nwhatever it is yeah all right man well I\nappreciate you I'm gonna cut it here\nbecause we're doing this for like a\nwhile but everyone be sure to check out\nday and next week I got\nblue I think yeah next week is Lou yeah\nwe're talking getting into Cloud uh he\nowns open up the cloud and just gives\nhim a lot of good uh people getting into\nCloud kind of advice and whatnot so uh\nbe sure to catch up that one and peace\nout Amanda",
