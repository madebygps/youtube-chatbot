  "title": "How I became an IT system administrator with no college degree",
  "transcript": "so i made a tick tock that went\nmega viral and i mean in my\nopinion\nuh on my tech salary progression going\nfrom 2014\n15 an hour to now 2022 so eight years\nthere\nmaking a hundred and seventy five\nthousand dollars base salary i didn't\ntalk about stocks total compensation\nanything because i feel like when people\nstart to talk about that it can get very\nconfusing um so yeah i spoke about base\nsalary and whatnot and a lot of people\nhad a lot of questions\nand a lot of people asked how i made\nthat jump from helpdesk which was\nsixteen dollars an hour so about thirty\nthousand dollars a year\nto junior sis admin which was my first\nsalary job at fifty five thousand\ndollars a year which was for me a\nsignificant jump in a significant amount\nof money so in today's video we're going\nto talk about to me it's four skills\nit's\nlearning a ticketing system\ndocumentation learning powershell or a\nscripting language and getting a cloud\ncertification\nso i'm going to address all of that in\nthis video\nwith all that being said hi i'm gps i\nlike making cloud computing videos and\nvideos on career and just things that\ni've picked up along the way\ndon't forget to like and subscribe it\nreally does help and it helps me to keep\nyou know creating free content and\nwhatnot and welcome to a new video\nalready so like i mentioned my helpdesk\ngig i was able to land without a college\ndegree and without any certification so\nno a plus which is a typical like help\ndesk certification that people get\ni had one and a half year 16 months to\nbe exact of experience and at a retail\nstore at an apple store to be fair the\nrole there was a technical role because\ni was sort of helping people with\niphones and ios problems and mac os\nproblems and whatnot and we did use a\nticketing system so the whole\ntroubleshooting mindset the whole\ndocumenting issues and whatnot i learned\nthanks to that gig\nand i also do very well at interviewing\nso i'll do another video on that too so\nwith that experience plus my\ninterviewing skills i landed my help\nthis gig but no other no educational\nbackground and whatnot\nthe helpdesk gig started i believe 16 an\nhour so\nthe entire time that i was there i was\nprobably making somewhere around 30 to\nmaybe like 32 000 a year\nand there was no\nstocks or bonuses or anything like that\ni didn't really encounter that until i\njoined microsoft which was is my latest\njob\nbut\nthe the jump from thirty thousand\ndollars a year to fifty five thousand\ndollars a year was significant and\nsignificant money for me too and there\nwas four things that i did to land the\njunior sysadmin room\nso the first one was\nlearning a ticketing system that is used\nat many many companies uh there's a\nbunch of them but the one that i knew\nspecifically was jira so i knew not only\nhow to\nuse queues in jira how to create tickets\nin jira how to you know\nadd documentation to jira but i\ntowards the end of my helpdesk career i\nalso got insight on how to like create\nyour own workflows in jira and a bunch\nof other things on like how jira\nactually works so that was definitely a\nplus going into my genius admin gig\nbecause that place was using jira as\nwell and they were going to need help\ncreating workflows and things like that\nso my help desk gig\nplus one on that also\nalong the lines of using a ticketing\nsystem was creating documentation on\nabsolutely everything that i could so\nany\nproblem that i was able to address and\nfix and resolve or even not resolve\nat my helpdesk gig\nwe were supposed to create documentation\non it that way as if someone else\nencountered the issue they could just\nuse the documentation that you created\nand save a lot of time right because\nhelp desk is all about\nfiguring out issues as many as you can\nand as fast as you can\nit's not really in-depth engineering\nit's more so just volume kind of thing\nwhich also teaches you how to work under\npressure and deadlines and whatnot and\nfor me it was a fun challenge because it\nwas it used to be like oh if i can take\nsort of four issues an hour\ncan i challenge myself to get to five in\na couple of months can i challenge\nmyself to get to six in a couple of\nmonths and whatnot so\nyeah creating documentation and creating\ndocumentation that was easy to share so\nother people could easily read the\ndocumentation there was there was\ndocumentation on\nwhat the issue was what i did that\ndidn't work and what i did that did work\nall these kinds of things including them\nuh was great so that was the second\nthing\nthe third thing\nwas having a which with getting a uh\nwhat was it oh a certification cloud\ncertification so for me it was the aws\ncertified developer associate\ncertification i got this question as\nwell the other day about oh should i go\nfor the solution architect associate or\nthe developer\ndeveloper associate i personally find\nthe solution architect certification\nboring and it just feels very like\ntheoretical to me where the developer\none was a lot more hands-on in my\nopinion and i had a lot more fun\nstudying for it i studied for both but i\nonly sat for the developer one and i\npassed that one\nbut there's a lot of overlap between the\ncontent for both of them\nbut i learned a lot and i learned what i\nneeded for my junior's admin gig from\nthe developer one but i also took my\nsweet time i took like six months to\nstudy from a certification\nand that these days is unheard of like\nyou'll go on linkedin and you'll see\npeople who pass certifications every\nweek every month and then you can tell\nthat that's just not a real way to soak\nin knowledge that will impact your\ncareer for long term like you really\nhave to take your time i'm not saying\nyou have to take six months it could be\nless but\ndon't just sit for certifications by\nmemorizing because you're not really\ngoing to get out of them and they're not\ncheap right if we think of\nmost cloud certs are at least 100 plus\nright some of the like uh comptia ones\nare like 300 400 right but anyway\nthat certification helped for my junior\ncis admin gig because that gig in the\njob description they were asking for oh\nwell you might if you're interested in\ncloud\nthen you'll have plenty of projects to\nwork on because we're migrating so on my\nresume i had my certification and then\nduring the initial phone call\nthe hiring manager asked me like oh yeah\ni see that you have the certification\nare you interested in cloud and because\ni had recently passed that and then i\nknew everything about the certification\ni like talked a lot about it\nand a lot about cloud computing in\ngeneral saying like yeah i'm very\ninterested in that\nso that was another thing that made a\nhuge impact into landing the role\nand the fourth thing was knowing a\nscripting language so in my case it was\npowershell now do i recommend powershell\nif you're working somewhere that you can\nget exposure to powershell by all means\ngo for it but you're if you're at a job\nthat you can't get any exposure to any\nkind of scripting language and you're\nlearning on the side i would recommend\nto go with bash just because bash is\nused for linux machines and linux\nservers\ntend to be more used in windows servers\nso it's more so kind of like getting\nyour best bang for your buck in terms of\nwhat you're studying for\nso go for bash but\ni didn't get too much experience with\npowershell\nit was more so like my own kind of\nscripts it was more so working with\nscripts that other people have written\nor seeing other people create scripts\nand kind of them taking time with them\nfor them to explain things to me\nbut i knew how to execute scripts i knew\nsort of being able to open up the script\nand see like what it like i could piece\nit apart i could like google things like\noh what does this command specifically\ndo and i could understand what was going\non and that made an impact into landing\nmy junior this admin gig because\nsys admin roles are all about automating\nthings\nuh you can think about like especially\nlike let's let's say like a windows shop\nwhich was the sysadmin gig that i got\nthey use windows and azure\nlike automating 365 things automating\nactive directory things automating\nthings on virtual machines all that\ncould be done with powershell so having\nthat knowledge\nand that experience even if it was a\nlittle bit\nuh it was enough because again the cis\nadmin gig was a junior so like mid-level\nor i guess entry level uh because his\nadmin roles typically are sort of\nmid-level either kind of roles that you\nget after support\nbut before you can get into like full\nengineering and whatnot\num not saying that you can't land your\nfirst role as a sysadmin it was just for\nme it was more so like a mid-level kind\nof thing um\nyeah but uh the hiring manager was more\nlike as long as you're aware and you've\nworked with these tools before i don't\nneed you to have extensive experience\nwith this because i understand this is\nstill like an internal mid-level role\nbut those were the four things that\nreally made an impact for me and again i\nreally recommend you\nknow how to take tickets know how to\ndocument your issues get some sort of\ncertification that will help you go\ntowards the role that you want to get to\nin my case it was the aws certified\ndeveloper associate\nand then learn a scripting language if\nyou can get exposure to a language at\nyour role whatever language that is do\nit\nand if you can't learn bash all right\nthat's pretty much it i'm going to have\na bunch of other videos following up\nabout how i did what i did to go from\njunior sysadmin to cloud engineer\nthen cloud engineer training architect\nand then training architect and now my\ngig cloud developer advocate at\nmicrosoft and i do also want to talk a\nlittle bit about\num\nbase salary and total compensation\nbecause there's a lot of questions\naround that as well\ni can talk a little bit more about\ncertifications education what not things\nlike that if you have any more questions\nleave them in the chat and i will do my\nabsolute best to well in the comments i\nwill do my absolute best to answer them\nand yeah thanks for watching and i'll\nsee you in the next video",
