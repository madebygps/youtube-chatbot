  "transcript": "so even though tutorials will help you\nlearn and improve your skill set they\ndon't really help much or at all when it\ncomes to Landing a job or improving your\nresume no one will ever recommend you to\njust put on your resume tutorials or\ncourses that you've done but they will\nrecommend\nthat you put projects\nthat comes down to the fact that you\njust struggle when you put a project\ntogether from scratch\nand you don't really struggle as much or\nencounter that was as many challenges\nwith tutorials because tutorials lay\neverything out for you step one step two\nstep three step four and whatnot\nso today I'm going to tell you where you\ncan find ideas on projects to build\nand then I'm going to show you sort of\nsome best practices and some things you\nshould include in your projects\nonce you have built them or as you're\nbuilding them and why not\nwith all that being said hi I'm GPS I do\nCloud things at Microsoft and here on\nYouTube and welcome to a new video so\nwhat I recommend people is to just go to\nthe architecture Center I'm going to go\ninto the Azure one now every cloud\nplatform has them\narchitecture centers are essentially\na collection of a bunch of different\narchitectures that are put together by a\nvariety of people who will work at that\ncloud for different reasons if maybe\nit's they got it from customer feedback\nuh examples of things they've\nimplemented\nyeah a bunch of different reasons\nso the best way I think to go about this\nis to kind of just look up a service or\na technology that you want to become\nmore familiar with maybe it's something\nthat you've done a course on maybe it's\nsomething that you're studying for a\ncertification on whatever it is right I\nalways give the example of the Azure pet\nstore which was a colleague Chris who is\na solution architect at Azure he was\nstudying for his 204 certification and\ndecided to create this project called\nthe Azure pet store all using services\nthat he was studying for that\ncertification and he has a awesome\nproject because of that\nnow for example I've I've searched here\nfor container apps and then there's a\nbunch of options here I'm going to pick\nthis one here because I think this is a\ngreat example\nnow not all of them will be as well\ndocumented as this one but there are a\nbunch that are like this so you're gonna\nhave to go and kind of filter through\nwhich one you like the most and which\none interests you the most in general\nbut for example here we've got deploy\nmicroservices with Azure container apps\nand dapper sounds like a pretty\ninteresting project container apps\nserverless applications serverless\ncontainers microservices Dapper these\nare all very very\npopular services in the last couple of\nyears so would be a great project to get\nhands on\nthe cool thing about this specific\nscenario is you have information on\npotential use cases you've got a diagram\ndata flow you've got what components and\nTechnologies you'll need to use some\nAlternatives scenario details here as\nwell consideration for liability cost\noptimization performance efficiency\ndeploy the scenario contributors oh and\nthey even have the code that you can use\nto deploy now\nthis is fantastic because I constantly\ntell people it's not just about the\ntechnical skill set it's not just being\nable to oh I know how to create this\napplication it's understanding why you\nhave to create that application in the\nfirst place what matters how much it's\ngoing to cost oh just all these bunch of\nthings so a lot of these architectures\nand examples will have\nthese um\nyou know additional resources and you\ncan see there's a bunch of links in here\nright so if we looked for I don't know\nanother one let's look for functions\num there's a bunch in here I liked I\nthink I saw one that was pretty\ninteresting at one point that I wanted\nto do because I come in here all the\ntime to grab ideas for demos that I want\nto build for uh events and whatnot uh\nthis was pretty cool instant\nbroadcasting with serverless code but\nyou can see some of these are for\nexample this one just says it's a\nsolution idea so it's a solution idea as\nin it's not as fleshed out as these\nother ones but it gives you kind of an\nidea of data flow components and AO\ndetails potential use cases and whatnot\nso depending on your level of expertise\nthis might be more than enough for you\nto get started or you might need a more\ndeveloped and fleshed out concept like\nthe one we saw before right\nso yeah go into your architecture Center\nfind something and start from there\nit's not supposed to have everything\nlaid out for you you need to struggle\nand piece the things together\nbut the good thing about piecing things\ntogether and sort of you know doing\nsomething more challenging than\nfollowing a step-by-step tutorial is\neach step that you try to do and you\nfail at that is a piece of information\nthat you should document\nbecause for example let me show you I\nhave a project here that I feel like is\nsomething that I would showcase on a\nresume if I needed to\nin my this is a serverless crypto\ntickers uh just to finish this point but\nthen we'll go through everything I have\na section that's known issues and so for\nexample if I was trying to create a list\nof things of like uh bugs that I've\nworked on that I've encountered things\nthat I'm actually fixing in this\nspecific project I would put it in the\nsection and any challenges that you\nencountered I would also highly\nrecommend that you have that section\ninside of this project or not\nso for example my read my the readme for\nthis GitHub because for this GitHub repo\ncontains all the information that I\nwould like a potential employer or just\nanyone who comes across this to have and\nI highly recommend you to have all your\nlike projects that were not on GitHub\nand well documented readme too and then\nif you have you should have your Cloud\nresume you should link to this mine\ndoesn't because I don't use it as a\nresume but I'll update it at some point\nall right so anyway\nhere we have the title of the project of\ncourse and then just a brief just one\nline two line description and then I\nhave the link to it live here if you can\nhave it deployed highly recommend it a\nlot of services out there have free\ntiers or run for you know a couple of\nbucks especially the serverless the ones\nthat offer serverless plans and when it\ncomes to learning I always tell people\nlike if you have to end up paying 20 30\nbucks a month to have your stuff running\nthat's worth it that's like a Netflix\nsubscription is like 20 a month like\ncome on you can afford to put in the\nmoney to learn with an actual Cloud\naccount right so anyway mine's deployed\nthere\nI have my architecture diagram here the\ninteresting thing about this is this is\nout this is actually two architectures\nbecause the project is taking it from\nthe starter project to the completed\nproject so I've included both of those\nin here so there are diagrams for each\none of those so not super complex or\nanything straightforward get the picture\nacross then I have a little bit more of\nin-depth information on the starter but\nyou can see I have a lynx Galore there\nare links to absolutely everything\nbecause these were the documentations\nand just references that I used when I\nwas trying to put the thing together\nbecause you are going to build things\nfrom scratch by piecing information\ntogether from other places again nothing\nis brand new you're not inventing any of\nthis but if you can sort of document all\nof these things the next person is going\nto come and maybe build on your solution\nor needs to understand more deeply Your\nsolution or you need to better explain\nyour solution you'll have the\ndocumentation that you reference right\nso I talk a little bit more about the\nstarter architecture the completed\narchitecture and whatnot then\nand this is a part that I really like\nthat I did here\nthe steps to go from starter to\ncompleted now if you clone all my code\nand you adjust your local dot\nsettings.json to include the connection\nstrings and keys and whatnot that you\nneed from your created Azure resources\nyou can have it going on on your on your\nown like you don't really need to build\nanything or whatnot you just need to\nedit that right however I've provided\nguidelines and advice and steps for\nanyone who wants to take my start\narchitecture and turn it into the\ncomplete architecture because this is\ngoing to get you hands on with Azure\nfunctions with Cosmos DB with signal R\nAzure blob storage and a couple of other\nservices in a lot so I wasn't included\nthose things here so some docs that I\nfound helpful when building the project\nand sort of just some steps now here I'm\nnot telling you put this line of code\nhere put this line of code there put\nthis line of code there I'm not I'm\ntelling you things like oh create a\nclass that will describe your object\nmine is here create a new function Azure\nfunction with a timer trigger I set mine\nto 60 seconds but you can adjust your\noccurrence or whatever you'd like\nmine you can find here and then other\ncolor other guidelines that you need\nhere too create an Azure function\nrelationship your trigger that will act\nas your signalr negotiate\nminus negotiate that CS now I'm just\ntelling you this is kind of what you got\nto do you're going to go and Google how\ndo I actually do this and maybe you'll\nprobably use the documentation that I've\nlinked above here which are pretty long\nlike this one's pretty long like it says\nhere two minutes to read but there's a\nbunch of other things that you need to\nlike go through as you walk through\nthese like for example\nthe stuff down here right\nso I'm giving you guidelines and I'm\ndoing that for the API part and then for\nthe client part as well so I'm not\ntelling you step one step two step three\nstep four and one now right but\nessentially it becomes likenot only a project for myself but a\nproject for other people which I think\nis pretty cool\nfinally I have included steps on how to\nrun locally uh again links to everything\nthat you need here and another thing\nthat I like here is I say all the\nprerequisites from this documentation\nwhich is again another longer thing that\npeople will have to take some time to go\nthrough\nanother important thing that I feel like\npeople should include are debugging\nsteps now this is a very developer\nfocused type project and I know a lot of\nyou may not be interested in developer\ntype projects but debugging isn't\nspecific just to code and development\nlike you could use this in a bunch of\ndifferent scenarios so whatever\ndebugging is for you\ninclude those steps in here so for\nexample I've I've got some custom uh vs\ncode tasks and have links to learning a\nlittle bit more about what debugger\ndebugging and the launch.json and\ntask.json files would do but then I tell\nyou which tasks will do what and what\nnot and then I've got some known issues\nnow for example\nI know that mydevcontainer.json which\nwill enable codespace's support and Dev\ncontainer spaces uh get Dev container\nsupports locally\nI have the file there but no it's not\nworking though it's not really\na major like it doesn't block the\nproject from working so it's sort of\njust a work in progress but it's a known\nissue I also know that I don't have cicd\nI've also noted that in here and there's\nalso a couple of other code performance\nenhancements that I want to do and I\nwant to document in here first so this\ncould potentially even be like someone\nwill be like oh hey and I encourage\nanyone here if anyone wants to implement\na CI CD for this project and then do a\nPR I would highly recommend you give\nthat a try and then I will\nhave you on my channel we can talk about\nthe project and whatnot uh but yeah this\nis also could potentially be come into\nlike if you open source a project tasks\nthat other people could do and then any\nother additional resources that I find\nuseful I will have in here as well\nso documented well project I think this\nis a good example\nnot to to my own horn but hey I've seen\na lot of cloud projects in my day\nI've done a lot of cloud projects in my\nday\nand I've done a lot of speaking to my\ncloud projects in my day as well so it's\nkind of like what I recommend the bare\nminimum if you want to do absolute more\ngo ahead and do it but just remember\nit's all about the sort of piecing\nthings together from scratch where you\nget the value and where you can actually\ndevelop that skill set so yeah anyway\nthat's all I got for this video I will\nsee you in the next one oh and don't\nforget to check out my Vlog Channel if\nyou like behind the scenes and just\nlifestyle and living in New York kind of\nstuff all right bye",
