  "title": "Difference between DevOps and Cloud",
  "transcript": "cloud versus devops\nit can be confusing because the people\nwho write these job descriptions will\noften say devops engineer and have a lot\nof cloud tasks in the description or\nthey'll ask for a cloud engineer and a\nlot of devops tasks in the description\nand the reality is that it really will\ndepend on the company that you go to\nwhen i was a cloud engineer it was a\nmedium-sized company i was doing cloud\nstuff devops off i operation stuff help\ndesk stuff networking stuff all these\nkinds of things right so it depends now\nhonestly in the current state of where\nthe space in the field is\nthere's always going to be overlap\nespecially when you're working with\ncloud because you have to implement\ndevops practices\nthough if you are a devops engineer you\ncould be working completely on plan on\nprem and not be working with any cloud\ninfrastructure that's what at all\nbut let's dive a little deeper into into\nthis so\nshameless plug on learn to cloud we have\nphase four devops fundamentals we don't\nfocus on every single devops practice\nbut there are some things that we\nrecommend you read\nsome of the\npractices that we do encourage you to\nfocus on as and this is just focus for\nbeginners right some resources some\nprojects some things you should be\nfamiliar with and some certifications\nthat you might be interested in\nlearn the cloud again is this open\nsource guide that richard and myself\nhave put together it's free we don't\ncharge you anything etc there's no catch\netcetera etcetera etcetera so i'll put\nthat in the description\num so devops has a bunch of practices\nthere's continuous integration\ncontinuous delivery which is developing\npipelines that take your application\nfrom point a from like whoever builds\nthem\nand works on them\nto point b where it actually is on\nwherever it has to be deployed on so\nyour clients can actually use your\napplication right so that is a pipeline\nbut in between there there might be some\ntest well there should be some testing\nsome infrastructure deployment some a\nbunch of other things that are sort of\nput into the middle of this pipeline\nright\num\nand for for csud popular ones are github\nactions if you are a beginner i highly\nrecommend just take a look at github\nactions because most likely your\nprojects are in github already\num and then there's like azure devops uh\nthere's circle ci there's a bunch of ci\ncd tools um but as a beginner focus on\nthe most popular ones and again i'm\ngoing to say github actions version\ncontrol\ndeveloping your code with versions that\nway you can roll back or see\nhow what other people have added to your\ncode because you can comment and things\nlike that\nthe most popular one is git\nthere are other ones but just learn\nlearn to use git get in github\ninfrastructure as code instead of having\nto click around to deploy your\ninfrastructure you are putting together\na file that you can then execute it and\nthey will build and deploy your\nyour infrastructure right\num\nideally you would take this file and you\nwould also put it through your ci cd\npipelines right\nand depending on which tool you use\nthere's terraform there is bicep there's\narm there's cloud formation there's\npollumi uh the language that you\nactually use to develop these uh files\nwill be different\nbut i just mentioned the most popular\nones each cloud has its own as well\num so yeah that's infrastructure's code\nand configuration management is\nmanaging a whole bunch of\nresources like uh servers which machines\ndatabases uh i think things like jenkins\nansible are popular here continuous\nmonitoring is monitoring your\napplication in every state not just when\nit's deployed um and tools like\nprometheus or datadog\nand every cloud platform also has its\nown set of monitoring tools azure has\nazure monitor um i don't know the other\nones i apologize but each one has their\npopular one um\nand then there's this book called the\ndevops handbook it's not a tutorial it\njust tells you about the devops\nmethodology the devops culture and the\npractices and why if you implement it\nit'll make your the end result um much\nmore efficient like developing and\ndeploying your infrastructure your\napplication\nmore efficient and you have your\ndevelopment which is the dev and your\noperations team which is the ops work\nbetter together\nand here it says how to create\nworld-class agility reliability and\nsecurity and technology organizations\num\ni really like this book highly recommend\nit no i'm not being paid to say this\nbut it's not tutorial remember devops is\na set of practices\nthat is what you need to fully\nunderstand\ndevops is a set of practices a culture\nthat you implement\nthere are different tools to implement\neach set of practice\nbut devops isn't like\nit's not you learn about terraform in\nyour devops engineer\nnow you have different tools to\nimplement different practices right\num\nokay cloud\nso now we switch a little bit into cloud\nlike i said you can implement devops\npractices on-prem and never have to\ntouch anything in the cloud\nmost companies have some sort of\npresence in the cloud now but there's\nstill a lot out there that just use\non-prem completely fine\non-prem is never going to ever leave\nthere's also hybrid\num but then you have cloud cloud\nengineers so cloud engineer is an\nextremely extremely generic and broad\nrole essentially if i see someone saying\ni need a cloud engineer they're just\ntelling me that you're going to work in\nthe cloud to some extent are you\nadministrating are you developing are\nyou securing are you architecting are\nyou working on governance whatever it\nmight be or maybe you're doing all of\nthese in one\nagain\nit mainly\ndepends on the company size smaller\nteams will have you doing more things\nhigher like larger more focused like\ncompanies that have have the ability to\nhave like more head count and such will\nhave more specific and\nfocused roles um\ni'm not saying it's a good or bad thing\nit's really kind of up to you when\nyou're in your career and what you want\nto do\num but for example let's take a cloud\nengineer who's most focused on\ndevelopment they will work side\nalongside the devops team to make sure\nthat the devops teams knows all the\nrequirements that you'll need for the\napplication to be deployed but they\nwon't necessarily worry about putting\nthose into the pipelines bringing those\ninto\nor defining the infrastructure as code\nor anything like that they'll just focus\non the application right if you are say\na cloud architect you are more so\nbuilding out the blueprint like hey we\nneed to use this service we should use\nthis over service over this service\nand then you might have to work with the\ndevops team to make sure they know\neverything um\nthat needs to get like deployed and such\num but you're not implementing any of\nthat\nuh what is another example that i give\ncloud admin uh cloud admin you might\nbecause you when you think of like\ncontinuous monitoring continuous\nmanagement i mean configuration\nmanagement continuous monitoring um\nthose are\ntasks that are pretty much\nwhat a cloud admin does like your goal\nis to go and make sure that all the\ninfrastructure is performing as it's\nsupposed to if there are any alerts\num you might need to look into them you\nmight be the first person who looks into\nthem um\nand things like that right so you might\nbe working alongside the devops team or\nmaybe even more so\nthat could be an sre which i'll cite\nreliability engineer which i will do a\nwhole nother video on because that also\nmakes things a little bit more confusing\nbut let's just focus on cloud dope today\num\n[Music]\nwell you get the idea right cloud\nengineer is going to be more focused on\nthe cloud side which whereas devops is\nmore focused on making sure we grab all\nthe stuff that needs to be in the cloud\nor on-prem and we deploy in a way that's\nvery efficient right with through these\ndifferent practices right i hope that\nclarifies things um they are very both\nareas are very high in demand pay very\nwell and then you can learn them online\num there's so much content out there to\nlearn all these things um and one thing\ni will say is like if you don't want to\nlike code a lot\nyou do enjoy coding but you don't like\nto code it like full-on applications\ndevops is\nyou're not\ngoing to be asked to develop full-on\napplications so that might be something\nto look into\ncloud also as as long as you're not a\ncloud developer because cloud developers\nwill be developing cloud applications\nall right that's it if you want more\nvideos on different roles or in\ncomparisons things like that let me know\nwith that being said uh\ni'm gbs and
