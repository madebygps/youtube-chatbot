  "transcript": "someone asked a fantastic question that\nI want to address about company loyalty\nif you were to if Microsoft were to lay\nyou off obviously with Severance but\nthen want to rehire you in say six\nmonths would you go back let's tackle\nthis one by one because there's another\nquestion in there too\nshort and sweet yes if the role was\nbeneficial for me if it was a situation\nwhere I was like yeah this is what I\nwant to do next with my career then yeah\nwhy not I don't think there's any point\nin holding grudges because you can get\nlaid off or whatever happens you hold a\ngrudge and you know for years and years\nyou kind of are dealing with those\nemotions and the day after this company\nlays you off they're not going to be\nthinking about you so it really only\nmakes an impact on you to hold a grudge\nthat doesn't really make a lot of sense\nto me\nobviously would be different if the\nwhole if I was treated unfairly if I\nfeel like was a lack of respect if I\nfeel like that's the whole way that the\nlayoff was handled was\nI don't know made me feel less than a\nhuman\nthat would make a a difference\nabsolutely but if it was just sort of\nlike hey you're being laid off here are\nthe reasons here's what we're offering\nyou Severance and all these kinds of\nthings I'm not all right cool at the end\nof the day working for someone working\nat a place is a business transaction on\nboth ends because you are providing a\nservice and being paid for it a company\nis paying for your service right and\nobtaining the the results or the work\nthat you're doing and and also it's a\nrelationship and just like any kind of\nrelationships uh like with a partner\nwith a friend with a family with\ncolleague it needs to be beneficial and\nrespectful and fair to be a healthy kind\nof relationship\nthere are obviously unfair relationships\nabusive relationships unhealthy\nrelationships but no one wants to be in\nthose\nobviously people get stuck in those or\nget involved in those for a billion\nreasons but we're not going to talk\nabout that in this video\nso at some point if you feel like this\nrelationship is no longer productive for\nyou then you're going to want to get out\nof it you're going to go to another job\nor if at some point your employer feels\nlike that for whatever reason then they\ncan move as well it's business on both\nends it has to be beneficial for you to\nwant to be there and that would include\nbeing at a place that you feel\nchallenged that you feel like you're\ndoing work that you enjoy do you feel\nlike you're respected that you feel like\nyou are paid fairly all those kinds of\nthings are very important right\nand this leads to\nthe the other part of this question here\nthat says do you love the culture at\nMicrosoft or any company enough to trust\nthem again company loyalty worsen versus\nmodern corporate model of protect\nprofits and shareholders interests at\nall costs\nI don't think trust and loyalty should\never be something that you\nhave to worry about in a business\nrelationship or in a work relationship\nbecause when you are hired somewhere\nthere are contracts there are laws that\nthe employer has to follow\nand\nthey cannot break or else they're\nbreaking the law and they can get in a\nlot of trouble you don't have to trust\nthem\nthey are just going to have to act the\nway that they're signing off that\nthey're going to have to act on because\nthere could be illegal issues there\nloyalty is also another thing that I\nnever really understood or this concept\nof like well a work family or like we're\nall like a one big happy family or like\nyou know we're like that is just it's\njust silly I feel like that was always\nused to kind of hold people\nback or feel like they deserve or they\nhave to put up with something because of\nwhatever reason\nand your family and your life outside of\nwork is very separate from\nyour colleagues and the relationships\nthat you have at work\nsure you can make great friends and\nprobably friends that will outlive your\ntime at a company\nbut that's different right\nso I don't really think loyalty plays a\na big part or any should play any part\nin in work right you are signing a\ncontract saying that you're gonna go do\nthis kind of work you're you have\nexpectations you'll have performance\nreviews and things like that so like\nyou don't need to have the concept of\nlike loyalty there when there's\npaperwork in place to to handle all that\nso I don't worry about that at all\nyou also don't need to have the concept\nof trust or work to do your absolute\nbest work I think that comes from\nyou know within that's like oh I just\nwant to do the best at what I do because\nthat's what I require of myself\nfor some people that might be a\ndifferent type of relationship and\nthat's completely fine\nI don't really need to be somewhere\nwhere I feel like I'm being treated\nfairly to do the absolute best work what\nI will say is that I most likely won't\nlast at that place for too much time if\nI don't feel like it's a healthy\nbusiness relationship\nuh and earlier on in your career you'll\nprobably go through a lot more of that\nthose than later on and oftentimes\npeople find themselves having to put up\nwith those for a bunch of reasons maybe\nthey absolutely have to put up with work\nwhere they feel like they're not being\ntreated fairly they're not being paid\nfairly because they have families to\ntake care of and they need the income or\nthey don't really know how to get out of\nit what's the next move for them a bunch\nof other things which is also why I\nthink having something like Financial\neducation and and\num being smart with money in general it\nwill enable you to be able to make more\nsort of level-headed\ndecisions in your career so you don't\nend up having to stay in these like\nterrible\nuh\nroles that you don't want to do or jobs\nthat you want to do\nalso could add that I'm sure there's a\nbunch of employers out there that take\nadvantage of the fact that they know\nthat someone can't leave or like they're\nin a\nbad situation or something like that\nwhich sucks and I hope that these people\nfind resources in ways that they can\nmake better moves\nfor themselves\nand I also understand that maybe the\nworld is set up in a way where it's like\noh there's no Financial education in\nhigh school and then we're sort of\npushed to go to college and make like a\nlot in debt and then you get out of\ncollege and you already have this\nmassive debt so you go and you take on\nany kind of job I understand that as\nwell\num\nI think maybe there's a little bit of a\nshift happening now where like all the\nfree knowledge is available on YouTube\nand all that kind of stuff makes\num us like it you can see that there are\nother options which I think is cool\nyeah I think I'm rambling now but anyway\nlong long video don't watch I would\nreturn to an employer that's laid me off\nif they wanted to rehire me and it was a\nbeneficial move for me there's no point\nin holding grudges because that employer\nmost likely forgets about you a couple\ndays after and you're going to have\nthese negative feelings with you for\nuntil you decide to let them go there's\nno point of that trust and loyalty\naren't really things that come into play\nwhen it comes to a work or business\nrelationship save that for your non-work\nlike save that for your friends for your\nfamily and all that kind of stuff\nall right that's it for this video",
