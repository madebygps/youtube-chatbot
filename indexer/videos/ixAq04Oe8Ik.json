thing about yours is you're\njust like in the back\nyeah there's enough space for it to not\nimpact your camera Oh you mean like the\nLED flicker thing yeah yeah because it's\ntoo bright look\nyou see\nyeah\nit's doing the like the low light stuff\nyeah so\nI bought a dimmer that I'll that should\nmake it\na lot more nice\nhonestly it's good enough\nuh all right so where are we at what's\ngoing on\nso\num let me move the stream yard\nto another\nmonitorokayshare my screen\nwhat up everyone Maxime Joshua\nring I'm supposed to just set up a\ndomain on Azure Cloud super\nstraightforward now I need to set up an\nAzure domain\nnice is this for your Cloud resume\nwhat up everyone happy Saturday worship\nand I are migrating learn to clone to\nazure\npreviously it was on GitHub pages but\nkind of last minute we we talked about\nthis like a couple days agoyeah the we did the 2022 catch up\nand that's when I think we just said I\nthink we saw the numbers I think I saw I\nsaw the numbers I'm like we have to\nmigrate this to Azure because\nprimarily it's going to be an\nopportunity for us to have something in\nproduction that we can use to one help\nother people get like Hands-On\nI like actually work on something that's\nHands-On and in production but two just\nuse it for demos like oftentimes I want\nto like create demos or tutorials around\nlike monitoring or stuff that needs\nactual metrics and kind of showcasing a\nreal use case is difficult when you\ndon't have something in production so\nhaving this is gonna be perfect\nyeah yeah\nso we we ran someum Google analytics so I have we did set\nup Google analytics for a GitHub page\nand when I went through the numbers\nI was in shock and then I think when to\nsome point you were expecting those\nnumbers\num but we didn't know the actual numbers\nuntil we saw it on on the dashboard and\nwe're like oh you know this is\nwe shouldn't Host this on GitHub Pages\ndo you do you have the numbers handy we\ncan share share with people I think I\ntweeted something pretty basic out about\nit\num we didn't do like a very involved\nretro on we kind of just chatted\nlike you took like a day to kind of go\nthrough the numbers and whatnot but it's\nvery yeah in my opinion for what it for\nzero marketing budget for zero anything\nit's like you know\nit's kind of just like social media the\nnumbers that we have or can you zoom in\nlike a lot let me know\nmore\nokay and then scroll down to yeah I\nthink this is good yeah yeah yeah okay\nsookay here is the website and this is\nlike what our focus is the the website\nbasically means the learn to Cloud\nplatform where\num all of the community members go and\nlearn about you know the six month or\njust the entire guide is is the website\nright I do know some some users uh\nprefer it using on GitHub but I think\ntowards the end it was more people just\nstarring it on GitHub rather than\nor reading stuff yeah because I think it\nit looks really good on the mobile even\nour doxify stuff looks really good on\nmobile it's more readable uh more\nstructured than GitHub so this is the\nguide this is the numbers we had for\n2022\nand I don't even think\nwe were live for the entire 2022.\nlike this is not a 12 month data is what\nI'm trying to say we didn't start it in\nJanuary\nas far as I know\nWe Didn't Start uh I can't remember when\nwe started doing I can look it up\nbecause this is doxify stuff yeahum\nI can look it up\num yeah when the traffic started hitting\nbut yeah these are the numbers so you\ncan go through the numbers\nno it could be it could be a year\nbecause I remember talking with oh wait\nno no no I don't think you look at it\nhere all right so for 2022 for what\nhowever long we were actually\nsort of more than just a GitHub repo we\nhad a 71 000 users and over 148 000\nsessions zero dollars spent in hosting\naverage of\n6415 users a month\nOctober was our highest month in usage\nwith you it disappeared okay 10 526\nusers\naverage of 400 users a day\non October 3rd we saw 2500 users oh my\ngoodness\nuh social referrals 1.4 000 direct 1.2\nwhat is direct like\ndirectly going to The Domain\nuh in the browser so like learn to\ncloud.guide okay going straight to\nthese numbers are just for October like\nfor social referrals so YouTube was a\nmajor one and Twitter because I think\nOctober was also the month where both of\nus posted something about learn to Cloud\nuh and then directors just people\nlooking up learn to Cloud\nso this in this 10 traffic was through\norganic search that's for the entire\ntime that's for the entire time yet\nso like you uh Google\nuh or other search engines and this is\nwith terrible SEO we have we have never\nput in\nany care for marketing SEO ads or\nanything whatsoever and we're not really\ngonna do we're no not we're not it's not\nwe're not really we're not doing any ads\never or we're not doing any paid SEO or\nanything like that moving forward right\nnow the focus is to just move it to\nAzure so we can have an in production\napplication to use for more educational\npurposes which I think is going to be\nfantastic the only downside I see here\nis this is actually going to start to\ncost us money\nyeah\num we're aiming to I mean we're aiming\nwe're using serverless platforms so\nconsumption-based uh app services so it\nshould be relatively give it everything\nthe majority of things are\nStatics are not Dynamic content it\nshouldn't be too expensive you know I\nI don't I don't know I mean I I see it\nsorts very somewhat similar to like\nhosting like a resume challenge\num\nbecause you know static content\nbut we'll seeuh yeah\ndream team in action the stream looks\ngood what's up angel\nit's 140 in India\noh my God what's up Nelson I saw if I\nsound sick it's because I am sick so\nyeah I was gonna say\nhow are you feeling today well I'm\nsignificantly better than the last time\nwe spoke but um\nyeah still very much like recovering it\nsucks because it was like I have so much\nstuff to record and be on camera for\ncoming up so\nhopefully I get better soon but I think\nthere's something going around\num it doesn't help that I'm such a heavy\nheavily populated areayou know so\nwe'll see but yeah how's everyone doing\nhappy Saturday do me a favor hit a like\non the stream I always like to do these\nchallenges at the beginning of of the\nshames where I was like I want to hit a\ncertain amount of people so let's try to\nhit 50 people live and y'all can help us\nby just liking sharing with anyone\num\nso yeah Vaz does Texas hi going to talk\nRussia what up\num okay yeah so we did start in February\nwhich was\ngood I guess 22.\nyeah because it shows\n5837 users for February which is like an\nawesome number just to start with so in\n11 months these are numbers from 11\nmonths yeahthat's pretty impressive for no\nmarketing no SEO no ads nothing\nespecially no SEO like I don't even know\nhow\nCasino SEO and we still reached 148k\nsessions\n148k session 70 78 71 000 users\nstartups\nthey had these numbers\nof like essentially all of it is organic\ntrue no it's not essentially all of it\nis organic because there's nothing paid\nthere's no paid ads there's no paid no\nit's direct from your YouTube stuff\num yeah\nno SEO that's that's one thing like I\ncan't figure out like no SEO and still\nlike 10 traffic was through organic\nsearch like imagine after docusarus goes\nlive and people start searching you know\nhow to become Cloud engineer or\nhow do I learn cloud and I'm pretty sure\nthe the numbers we have with doxify like\ndocusarus numbers will still be great\nbecause we still have those 71k users\nthat are visiting this site every now\nand then like a little bit ranking\nreally good\num\non on these searches whether it be\nGoogle inductor go or Bingjacked\nact monitoring data directly via like\nsdks into in this case it'd be\ntypescript so leveraging oh yeah the\nmonitoring the Azure monitoring sdks\ninto that and then pulling out some\ninformation some interesting information\nthat way and then overall infrastructure\nmonitoring data will get via just Azure\nmonitor which would be cool too\nyeah moving forward yeah I don't regret\nhaving this a year on GitHub pages but I\nsometimes I look at the numbers and I'm\nlike oh my goodness the amount of just\ncool stuff we could have been able to\num\nthe Creator yeah the other thing is I we\ndon't have any insights into the\nperformance yeah that's what I care\nabout I don't care about like people or\nusers data or or like demographics I\ndon't care about any of that I care more\nabout we have an application in\nproduction like how do we make how do we\noptimize it like what's the difference\nbetween having it as like a monolith or\na micro service oh how easy is it to\nimplement like a serverless feature on\ntop of it stuff like that that's what I\ncare about yeah and that's that's what\nI'm excited about too is now being able\nto not only like this stuff is cool okay\nyeah we get a lot of users\num but like with those users like how\nare we performing what is the\nperformance of the actual you know\nstatic web apps in production and\num like what's the response time and\nyeah all of the cool stuff yeah all\nright I want to build a dashboard\na dashboard like I would like to build a\npublic dashboard exactly yeah yeah like\nsomething like uptime.learn to Cloud dot\nguide exactly and people can see all of\nour metrics from different regions and\nthen people can use that for their own I\ndon't know tutorial inspiration on\nwhatever yeah or you know go and like\ncreate a Hands-On lab or something like\nthat maybe we can build an API around it\nI think that would be really awesome\nmore so just leveraging\nbecause I I remember talking about like\nI want to create projects for learn to\nCloud but the hesitation was always what\nwhat's the project\nand who's going to maintain it so at the\nend of the last year we were just like\noh let's just make learn to Club the\nproject\nand then yeah yeah and like Community is\nbenefiting from it we are benefiting\nfrom it because we're getting this\nexperience\nyeah we've gotten to flex your umsaw your Tweet your typescript your\ndevops things I haven't done any\nengineering this is all worship I'm sort\nof just\ngiving my opinion\num\nand that's why we had to do this live\nstream because I'm stuck\nyeah let's let's take a look at what\nthat's going on hold on let me see yeah\nwhen you guys talk about static web apps\nyou mean html reactor view based apps\nright yeah so Azure static web apps has\nessentially static front end and then\nserverless API backend yeah uh we don't\nhave we're gonna I'm gonna definitely be\nimplementing some stuff as an API that\nwill integrate with our front end we\ndon't have anything at the moment\nbecause everything is static\num but this is react on the front uh\nsakusars for the duck because learner\ncloud is heavily just documentation so\nfor the documentation purposes we're\ngoing to be using docusars at the front\nend and that's react and I don't really\nknow what else is part of the front\nyeah so yeah and we're we're using\ntypescript\num\nor react and then\nwhat else yeah nothing else\num I don't even know what CSS stuff\nthey're using so I'm not gonna talk\nabout it\nuh but yeah\nso\nI used\nso I'm gonna catch you up you're pretty\nfamiliar already with because you paste\nthe link of the yeah yeah the action\nrunning and just put in the chat and\npeople are going to see what's going on\ntooso when was pretty caught up with with\nwhat's going on\num but just to recap I have so we have\nour docusara stuff it has been merged so\nI've been working on the\nmain branch I'll Zoom this in so that\nit's readable\nlet me know when it's good\nuh yeah do one moreyeah you're good there\nokay\nso\num\nso I've done two things now\none is I use the Azure extension which\nis awesome uh to deploy a static web app\nright through vs code what it does is it\ngives mean action\nright and you can see it in the vs code\nextension on the on the right hand side\nso under static web apps you have learn\nto Cloud your production you have\nactions and this is the action that it\naddedthis\nis Main Branch okay that's why I feel so\nbad because now it's all messed up and\nby messed up I mean you know failed\nactions different commits over time kind\nof thing the website is still live\nbecause we moved toxic fire away yeah\nso this is the action\num this was\nthe default action that uh the extension\ngenerated so it asks you a few things\nyou know the application which for us is\nroot so this is the root of the\ndirectory you have Source you have\nstatic no modules and stuff and then the\nmain thing it looks at is the\npackage.json to\nuh identify what kind of project this is\nso packet.json usually means some\nJavaScript framework and then in that\nyou have scripts and stuff to build\nright so start build deploy clear serve\num and what doxy docus RS uses since\nit's based on react you just do npm run\nbuild it'll give you a build directory\nin this\nand that build directory can be served\nstatically by\nuh static web apps so that's what we are\ntrying to do\nso going back to that action that we\nhave that was created by\nthe extension right so you can see the\napplication is root which is fine API\nallocation doesn't matter because we\ndon't have an API yet we will have it in\nthe future\noutput location as I said it creates a\nbuild directory after we run npm run\nbuild\nso this is the default action up until\nthis point but then I was going through\nsome documentation and you can have you\ncan specify a app build command and in\nmy case I know it's npm run build Okay\nso\nI don't have to\num it it will run this by default if\nit's a you know node or\nreact view is it everything even if you\ndon't have this yeah so that's what it\nwas initially like this didn't existed\nuh it ran it failed\nI tried it again by changing the API\nlocation because I'm like we don't have\nan API so maybe that could be reason and\nI saw a lot of uh\nstack Overflow stuff and GitHub issues\ncomments saying oh I removed the API uh\nsetting and it worked so I did that it\ndidn't\nand then I moved it back into the\nconfiguration and then added this and it\nstill didn't and now I'll show you what\nthe error is so the error it says is it\nfinds the app directory location\nright\num it's starting to build the app with\ncan you make this largertwo yeah that's good scroll down more\nall right cool there perfect\nyeah so it starts building it it has\nidentified the root location and the\nEric is it gives is could not detect the\nlanguage from repo\nand it says finish building up with\nO-rings and faint to fi fail to find the\ndefault file in the app artifacts folder\nlike I don't know why it's looking at\nthe root it should be looking at the\nbuild directory\num no API that's fine because we don't\nhave an API yet\nand I have been going through\num\na lot of you know stack Overflow and\nGitHub issues regarding the same error\nmessage\nand people have posted about itum and I tried doing the the exact steps\nthat they did and might have fixed it uh\nbut this this issue is still open so I\nmade a comment with my\num\nthe issue I'm facing is you know hey\nthis is the action that the static web\napp created it's a docusaurus project\nusing react\num I did specify the app build command\nI've tried removing you know the API\nlocation and it hasn't helped and I also\nposted the repository structure so that\nyou know\nthey have all the details if anyone\nlooks at this issue\nbut the GitHub action fails with the\nfollowing errorso that is what I have tried right\num the other thing I wanted to share is\nI looked atthisokay I'll zoom in let me scroll up yeah\nso\nexcitingly Nita I think yeah he works\nfor Microsoft she has a shout out shout\nout Nita she has a whole project on on\ndocosaurus yeah she has a lot of sites\ncreated with docusar she's like an actor\nexactly so I'm like\nshe would know how to deploy this with\nAzure static web apps and that's exactly\nwhat she did in this 30 days of static\nweb apps\num so she has the site that she\ncustomized a bit just like us you know\nwe customize it for learn to Cloud\nuh tutorial sources GitHub so I looked\nahead of every GitHub code and also went\nthrough the entire demo just to you know\nsee where did I do things wrong\nso this can be skipped because this is\njust customizing the site but this is\nwhere the good part is about deploying\nit to\nazure\nso you can do it through the Azure\nportal and that's what I did today so\nall of the vs code extension stuff I did\nit yesterday and I called it a day and\ntoday I did it through the portal and\nsame thing is happening\nforeigncode extension and we'll go through this\nso you need to make sure you have the\nweb apps extension installed\nand this is the exact thing I went\nthrough like I clicked on the little\nplus icon in the vs code it asks you you\nknow\nshould\nAzure perform actions for you\num in nvs code and then you enter\nsome details about the static web apps\nso in our case this was learn to Cloud I\npicked East us2 because that's the\nclosest\nspecified project name which was react\nand then for\ntheir particular reason the the site\nexists the docusaurus\num configurations and the project itself\nexists not in the root but www inside\nroot\nand then you also have to specify where\nthe output will be which is the build\ndirectory\nso in my case the only difference was\nnot having www here and instead have\njust a slash which would represent root\nof my app\nand that was it\nand in her case it deployed it\nbut in our case it failed\ncan you do you have their link to her\nrepo yep right here so this is the repo\nand this is uh the root of the repo\nwhich is\nfine because she has all the docusara\nstuff in www\nand this is how exactly are\nuh root looks like\nso we have Source static we don't have\ntests but we have everything else placed\nher into the private chat I'm gonna open\noh yeah\noh\nokay\ntoo many tabs I have to figure out where\nstream yard isokayall right let me open this\nlook at our actionscode GitHub or close\nit's which yaml is it\nit's the Azure static web apps Lively\ntree yep\nhave you compared this to ours\nyep\nand like nothing is different\nuh apart from the app build command but\nI have tried removing that toocould be\nuh let me look at ours[Music]workflows which one is ours\nso you should see two now because I did\ncreate one through the portal now uh-huh\nso you could look at the portal one too\nlike theForest\ns uhuh let me look at this uh branches\nbranches main open me yeah agreeable\nForest yeahuploadapp location app location\nso our app is in root\napp isn't root\nand an API location we don't have one\nyeah output location build\noutput location app location okayfails to detect the language\nall right let me see her\n[Music]\nwww\nuh on a clouduh\nuh blah what is it used to detect\nconfigurationlike package yeah for node projects as\npackage.json yeah\nwhere is our package that\nit's in the root\nhopefullyicts config sidebar docosaurus Babel\nreadme license contributors your code\nname I don't see it here\nseriously static sorry I'm at root like\noh you're right I don't see it either\nwait what ha ha\nwhy do I have it in in my vs code and\nnot there let me check the get ignore\nyeahthat is so silly it's right it's it's in\nyour getting ignored ah come on\nso yeah remove that and then try itwait a second\nI want to do get blame now\nJose I think that's the person who did\nSpanish translations ah I see okay just\nso yeah remove it I mean just comment it\nout actually\nyou don't need this\nlet me see it from the tophit that like button people skip to 50.\nwe hit 40 at one moment but we went down\nuh how's everyone doing we're trying to\nfigure out we're doing some\ntroubleshooting on our CI CD pipeline to\ndeploy uh learn to Cloud to Azure static\nwebsite I should have done a good pull\npost\nyeah definitely\nuh and we we figured out something we're\nhoping this will\nfix it\nokay uh now I see\npackage.jsonpackage.log Jason what will\nbe posted out awesome\nokay\num uh removedpackage\nuh Jason fromthat's a good commit message what up\nLawrence T bohowill this be saved yet uh not on my\nchannel uh Richard Are You Gonna Keep\nthe recording live\nI mean available public\nyeah I'll see yeah could keep it keep it\non go watch it on Richard's Channel if\nyou want\nuh\nuh yeah cool\nokay is it there now now is the\nnicely time but like check check the\nroute to see if it's there\nI think soyeah yeah see that wasn't there before\nso now check that cacd and see what's\ngoing onthat was sopretty sure it'll build it now\nlet's hopeokay it went past that this deploysum\nthis is a place straight to the what's\nin the research group right like you\nalready created aesthetic web app and\nthen I can go and click the URL\nAssociated to that static web app and it\nshould load learn a cloud exactly yeah I\nhave it open here so we'll seeforeignright nowtold you dude it's got to be something\nsmall it has to be something small yeah\nbecauseI think it's easy to catch something bigI don't know I just have a feelingwhen you're also when you're like super\ninvolved in something exactly you tend\nto like look over the simple things like\nit can't be that no way it can be it's\nlike when you when you have issues in\nyour code because of like a semicolon or\nsomething like that it's like yeah yeah\nI was like you know packet.json has got\nto be there\nlike I and I don't add it to you know\nbecause I knew to get ignore\nfor docsify that when I created it\nI didn't include package.json to be\nignored right yeah someone else yeahoh this is the worst part about cacd is\nwaiting\nforeign\nyeahand I think we could really use those\ncustom commands like the app build\ncommands especially with this stuff like\nwe were talking about today in in\nDiscord\num you know about having Dev and prod\nyeah yeah yeah staging environments\nstating environments yeahcomply compiling client yeah I know I\nhave to resolve these\nmarkdown link cannot be resolved yeah\nthese these are the ones that where I\ntold you about they included absolute\npaths instead of relatives\nso once it's once the CI CD Works what's\nleft\nonce the ICD Works nothing is left and\nyou can work on the API\num what I'm doing tonight what I'm doing\ntonight is migrate not migrating\npointing the domain to these static web\napps\nbefore we do that let's let's make sure\nthe monitoring data that we want is in\nplace first oh sure yeah so I want to\nsend any traffic without having like\nabsolute basis oh you see what you mean\ncool\nyeah so once oh there we go our static\nweb app is live um so once yeah once I\nhave a go from you I can I can do that\num translations are working\nyeah I have to remove that\nI had a note on the top saying\ntranslations will be coming soon\num but yeah then yeah I talk to you and\nyou're like no let's ship this when\ntranslations are in yeah absolutely\nso I have to I have to go in and edit\nsome of this copy here did you remove\nthe links down from down\nnope I'll be doing that let's clean that\nup too yeah yeah I think that those\nshould be easy but yeah Portuguese\nNepali French\nEnglish\nnice Okay cool so I'm gonna go and pull\nthis and then I'll make the edits and\nthen I can just push and I'm good right\nyeah oh yeah let me also clean up\nbecause I have two actions right now\nyeah clean that up and then let me know\nyeah I'll let you know I will pull and\nthen make any edits and then I will and\nthen you can go and edit you know links\nall that kind of stuff\nuh I'm gonna Implement Azure monitor\nfirst and then ideally we should be able\nto go live either tomorrow or the day\nafter\ncool so tomorrow's Sunday right\nyes uh so probably yeah let's aim to be\nlive by Monday\ndo a do a little uh Lighthouse yeah yeah\nyeah yeah let's see yeah let's see how\nwe're doingcool coolokay so performance is 86 but everything\nelse so accessibility and best practices\nare 100.\nI see\num let me do it in private\nit says Chrome extensions negatively\naffected this page because I have some\nblockers for\nstuffum\nforgot to copy the URLohokay there we go\nlet's try that againdesktop navigation\nsurethere we go\nawesome nice so we score 100 on almost\neverything except the SEO\nand that is also a huge Improvement by\nwhat we had before yeah and I can show\nyou what we had before if someone is\num interested\nin the chat\noh I see\noh this is this is that stuff we were\ntalking about\nwhat is it umso the link text says this uh\num yeah we do have some\nyou do have some\nlike typos and stuff in place so we'll\nfix that and that is the only thing\num that was in\nthe SEO so I think that should bring us\nup at least 95 maybe 100 I don't know\num it is not a progressive web app so it\ndoesn't it didn't do anything\nthere\nbut yeah I'm pretty happy about this\ncool cool all right so yeah do you clean\nup pipeline stuff now and then I'll pull\nand then I'll do\nno do all your copy do all your your so\nyour pipeline your links and any other\nkind of stuff and then I can pull and\nthen make edits to I don't know any\nspelling errors anything like that I'll\ngo over yeah uh and then I'll work in\nAzure to implement whatever monitoring\ndata we need to dosounds good cool uh we're gonna go do\nthat offline because it's very async we\ndon't both need to be on it yeah but uh\nyeah I hope to have this live\nsooner everyone\num but yeah we're gonna end this oh\nwhich extension are you using to be the\nmetrics\nwhat do you mean\nthat's what this person's asking here\nI'm assuming these are like the the\nlight the numbers yeah oh the the seos\nstuff yeah\nthis it's built in into everything yeah\nlike Chrome and Edge and Firefox has its\nown version of this so you should be\nable to just to inspect\num and then\ngo up on the top it should say\nlighthouse\nyou click on Lighthouse and you click on\nperformance or do a testand it should do it for you\nall right\ncool thanks everyone for hanging out uh\ncash recording on Richard's Channel and\nbe back I don't know\npeace out\npeace",
