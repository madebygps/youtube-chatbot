  "transcript": "everybody i'm going to show you how i\nmade this magic mirror it's not a\ntutorial because there's plenty of\ndocumentation it's an open source\nproject\ni think it's magic mirrors.builders but\ni'll link all that stuff\nin the description this is mainly just\nkind of like a vlog style video of how i\nbuilt this\nuh yeah i have a lot of cable management\nto do and such uh\nbasically i just have vga and then power\nconnected to this power strip that's\nmounted\nand the raspberry pi is also mounted\nonto the door and it's just a single\ncable going up\nto like an outlet uh i want to clean it\nup more\nand the mirror i want to put some\nmaterial on it\nthat makes it darker because you can\nstill differentiate\nthe display from the actual gloss\nand the modules i have are just my\ncalendar and then\nwhether the pokemon daily pokemon and\nthen one that i made\nwhich is daily so quote and then spotify\nwhenever something's playing it'll\ndisplay on here\ni want to create another one that will\ngo like in this section\nthat'll show me some azure uh like my\nmonthly azure bill here\nand then maybe something else here i\ndon't know but uh that might be a\ndifferent video\nuh so this is a raspberry pi 4. you're\nmost likely familiar with this\nlittle thing it's basically a tiny\ncomputer and this is an old display that\ni have\nthat i don't use anymore because it's\njust vga and it's really old\nit's not that great quality and i've\njust got it hooked up to like\na keyboard and a mouse and actually vnc\nis on this so i can use vnc viewer and i\nhave it on my main laptop\nwhich is you know i just remote into it\nbut uh what i want to do\nis take the guts of this of this like\ndisplay so basically just have the panel\nand then i'm gonna put it behind a\ntwo-way mirror\nmaterial and i'm gonna make a magic\nmirror um you might have seen a bunch of\nposts\nabout this tons of people have done it\nalright so probably first good step\nwould be to maybe load on\nlike a built-in module[Music]all right so i'm gonna open up spotify\nwe see\nit's loaded on here and if i changed it\nto like this one\nit's pretty responsive nice like most\nthings in my technical toolkit i've\nlearned them by\nlooking at other people's examples that\nare online and googling stuff so\nsince i have very little experience with\nnode.js that's what i'm going to do so\nshout out to the people who\nmake their work available online for\nothers like us to\nlearn from this is i'm just looking at\nsomeone else's repo\nthat is a great way to\nyou know learn stuff just looking at\nwhat other people have built\n[Music]all right it looks like i had a few\ntypos but now let's go\nand run it again and\nlet's go thereoh it's still oh it worked holy sh isn't\nit it workedoh my goodness i was about to lose my\nmind there let's go full screenthe mirror has arrived so the display is\nkind of i didn't really take it apart\nyou can see that\nthe still like the front border is still\non it\num but this is mainly just for like\ntesting purposes so i rotated it\num originally i had it like that way and\nit was going to be you know\nthe other um orientation but this kind\nof looks cooler\nbecause i feel like i can just mount\nthis and i get more of like a\nfull body view um so just picked up this\ncase\nwell it was just delivered to me uh i\nthink this was like 10\non amazon it actually looks pretty neat\nlike has a nice clean look to it and it\ncomes with a little fan that you can\nattach to the pins that are on the\nraspberry pi\nand it keeps it cool so now what i'm\ngoing to do is take off this\nframe from the display if you guys do\ntake a part of the display\nthere's a lot of these ribbon cables\nthat are connected like some of them\nmight be hidden so you want to make sure\nto disconnect them all like for example\ni have this one and this one\nand this one here just connecting before\nhe actually takes off apart\nour little change of plans i'm actually\ngoing to go ahead and see if i can put\nit in the door\ni've recruited some help\nwhat are you thinking dude you think\nit's gonna worknicethis is what\nlet's seeand here we have the finished project\nagain i want to put some tint on\nthe mirror because since the display is\na lot darker and the mirror is actually\nquite clear\nyou can see the display pretty heavy\nthrough it but if i tint\nthe mirror it should uh should look well\nalso the back needs a lot of work cable\nmanagement and such\nbut again just to get it mounted and\nstart actually like building some cool\nmodules uh\ndoes the trick looks pretty neat",
