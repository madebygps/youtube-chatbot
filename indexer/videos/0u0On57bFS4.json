you[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nforeign\n[Music][Music]lower the music\nforeigndone with my udemy curse on CCP from\nStefan for my exam in December nicethat's what's upthat first I feel like if you study well\nfor your first certification for your\nfirst class for vacation\neach certification after that is\ninfinitely easier\nas long as you take that first\ncertification\nas you know you pace yourselfand you really take the time to learn\nthen everything after that has become\nbecomes like a lot easier to study in my\nopinionyes I'm off from work today\nI decided to take a day off today andtomorrow every\nevery couple of months or so I like to\nschedule out like just one or two days\noff and then I have myself a nice long\nweekend\nespecially after hectic periods so this\npast couple of months we had\nstudents I had serverless September\nstudent Summit pre-ignite events I did\ntwo events at ignite and then I did an\ninternal event\nand then now we're prepping for net comp\nso but there's a little bit of kind of\nspace there\nI'm actually working on a Blazer project\nnow for the demo of that butso every now and then I like to take\nthis time off just a couple of days to\nnot do anything but I'm still doing\nstuff I'm still like working on\nsomethingum but yeahhow you doing hey GPS I'm majoring in\ncyber security two semesters to go till\nI graduate\nI am also taking the Microsoft skill\nchallenge devops course what steps\nshould I take going forward I don't know\nsteps you should take going forward I\ndon't know\nwhat you want to get into\nyeah yeah yeah\numyeah do you know what role you want to\nget into\nuh but yeah JJ have a\nhave a good have a good day\nthanks for coming byuh\nI was planning on just\nplaying video games today but\nI got sucked into this project that I'm\nvery much enjoying so\nit's kind of just\nyou ever like work on something that you\nenjoy so much where you can't stop\nlike you're kind of in the zone\njust kind of where I'm at with this\nprojectlet's seewhat do we got hereloved your uh salary video oh thank you\nyeah the response to that I got to the\nvideo were interesting\nI think um someone asked me like\nif I'm ever scared of to talk about\nmoney\nand then I used to have that mindset but\nthen I felt like if I allow money to\nhave\nany kind of power eventually is going to\nhave power over me and I never want to\nlive a life where money has power over\nme so I'm more so like just try to be as\ntransparent as I can in a respectful way\nbecause I don't think my value is\nyou know a professional\nuh or as a human being is attached to\nhow much money I make like if I miss if\nI got fired tomorrow which have y'all\nseen the layoffs of Microsoft it was\nlike a thousand people lay off\nuh what was it two days ago\nthank youum\nyeah that was wild so I don't use social\nmedia anymore\num I decided to quit social media like\ntwo weeks ago\nso I only I only log in to like\npromote or share anything that I need to\nshare but then I don't like consume it\npersonally like if I need to retweet\nsomething whatever I need to yeah\nso I didn't find out until layoffs until\nI logged into Twitter and then someone\nhad dm'd me it's like oh hey Gwen\nhopefully you weren't impacted by the\nlayoffs and I was like what the heck\nso then I like went on to like search\nfor the news and yeah that's a thousand\npeople get laid off it's like wowI was thinking more into Cloud security\nengineer there's a whole video that I\njust did an interview with day who works\nin security he um\nit's like a whole hour more just talking\nabout how to get into the space I\nrecommend you watch that because I'm not\na professional in security so I don't\nreally have the best advice in that\nvideo he mentions there's two\ncertifications he recommends every\nsingle beginner do and then you start in\nsock analysts and kind of move your way\nup I don't remember what their\ncertifications were but they're in that\nvideo I think it was like one or two\nvideos ago\nplatform versus devops engineering what\nare your thoughts on the new title\nI don't think devops engineer should\nhave ever been the title in the first\nplace because devops is a methodology\nand also develops is something that\neveryone should do\nso if platform engineer comes and takes\nover what the devops engineer was\nsupposed to do I don't really\nnecessarily have an issue titles or\ntitles this is the same thing where\nsomeone asked me like do you think the\ntitle Cloud engineer will go away I was\nlike maybe\nI think cloud known as the way it's\nknown now the word will probably go away\nbut there's going to be a place where\num\nyou know you go and deploy your stuff\nthat's going to be managed if that's\nCloud if that's air if that's space\nwhatever it ends up being called like\nthat still is going to be a thing so\nI don't know people don't need I don't\nthink people need to worry or\nnecessarily like get hung up on like\ntitles and whatnotyeah\nit's cold in New York todaygot it thank you\nstart doing CTF and learn from try hack\nme best of luck ah\nI think I did one try hack me\nroom because I think they're called\nRooms right or I can't remember it was\nfun\num I was just stuff that was as fun\nfor cloud that like try hacked me is for\num security butlet's see heream I 1080 yes I amwhat up easy how you doingI need to get another screen to put it\nhere\nif not always end up looking over herehey GPSI want to get into Cloud mainly Cloud\nsecurity I'm an I.T specialist in the\nmilitary so I can only have four years\nof experiences help desk I've earned the\njob as a system admin managing\nmanaging something\nwhat up Jay\nwhat up Finelli do you play Valerian no\nI don't play\nI play 2K I play writers RepublicI just finished dying lightum I I before that I played like Far Cry\n6 I'm still playing Far Cry 6. I like a\nlot of open world gamesI like games that I can just fully\nimmerse myself just by myself\nand kind of just Escape everything a\nbreath of the Wild on switch is fun too\num\nyeah one of my favorite games all of all\ntime is called days gone\nand then I also really enjoyed sleeping\ndogs I wish they made a sequel of that\nthat was such a great game but I'm a\nvery much open world type person uh\ncomes to that\nover 500 accounts troubleshooting from\nHardware to software I've worked with\nokay it's like what\nwho should I learn to subscribe so if\nyou want to get into Cloud security go\non my channel there's an interview with\nthis guy called day\nhe's a security engineer detection\nsecurity engineer at datadog and he\nlanded that role he's like 21 or 20\nyears old now he landed it all through\nlike uh leveraging prior experience\nprior internships\nand just kind of working really really\nhard\num he doesn't have a degree he's still\nin school and he kind of lays out\nabsolutely everything that he did\nthere's two certifications that he\nmentioned that everyone who like sort of\nwants to step into Cloud security should\ndo uh and then to kind of start from a\nsock analyst role move your way up it's\na video on my channel from like two days\nago it's like an hour and a half long\ninterviewuh\nuh he also mentioned that from the he\nhas the trifectus he has a plus Network\nplus and Security Plus and then from all\nthat he really says that only that like\nthe network plus was what he would\nconsider useful which was an interesting\nmindset but go watch that stream\nbest open world is Red Dead Redemption\n2. that was a good game too yeah\nabsolutely\nI don't I think I enjoyed sleeping dogs\nmore\num but that red dead was a good game tooum I'm playing Sleeping Dog\nstraightening sleeping dogs right now I\nactually want to get into Watchdog ah I\nplayed Watchdogs too I didn't play the\noriginal one I played the second one\nwhich is my favorite and then they came\nout with that other one which it was\njust well I can't remember what it was\ncalled but it was just trying too much\nit was fun but I found it like more\ngimmicky than anything I really enjoyed\nthe second one thoughuh\nuh hold on I'm gonna move this over here\nso I'm not like watching this side all\nthe timehow much do you order on YouTube uh\nanywhere from five hundred dollars to\nuh 700 800 a month\nit depends it fluctuates depends on how\nmuch work I put into itand I I don't turn on ads on all my\nvideos so I could make significantly\nmore but hey\nI have other priorities at the momentuh what's this other question hereI just found out that the dp300 has Labs\nat the end of the exam I ended up\nfailing with 60 cents I would write the\nexam next week oh the dp300 has Labs I\ndidn't know that that's coolwhich one is the dp300oh Microsoft Azure SQL\nI want to get the cosmos DB\ncertification\nI've been learning a lot of Cosmos DB a\nlot of um specifically I mean I was\nusing the core sequel API\num\nbut now I'm doing more of the um\nmongodb one the mongodb one has\nuh it's been a lot more fun to work with\nthan\nthe core sequel one for sure but\nI I can't I'm trying to like retrieve a\nrandom document and there's like no\nstraightforward way\nfrom a collection to do it also when I\nwas modeling up my data at the beginning\nI was because my experience is somewhat\nfrom like a relational\na relational\nuh data like database so I was modeling\nevery single entity out in a table\nand I sat down and I read this\ndocumentation that mongodb they have\nlike a great example and I was like oh\nmy gosh mind blown\nso yeah that's how I spent my yesterday\nhave you taken any yeah Linux uh Linux\nEssentials is the only Linux\ncertification that I have\nI think it might be expired by now I\nthink I might have expired the beginning\nof this yearlet's seewhat else some open world games that I\nreally enjoyedlet's move this over hereI've been uh coding a lot let me see if\nI can show y'alllet's move this hereuh we're gonna just remove\nhold onbecause I'm trying to learn Blazer right\nuh hold on that should be a demo all\nright cool everyone hear me yeah yeah\nokay so I'm trying to learn Blazer\num and what I have right now is\nI really need to like\nuh update\nall right so I'm gonna comment this one\nbecause I'm still figuring out how to\nget a random document\nbut\neverything else is uh sort of working\nfine nowso let's start thisall rightif you had if you had a chance to learn\nhow to learn to code again how would you\ndo it\nuh cyberpunk was trashdid it crash okay cool\nso right now we have this terrible table\nbut\nthese are coming in from\nthese definitions are coming in from my\nmongodb\ndatabase that's in Cosmos\nif you have one collection right so\nessentially what it is is going to be a\ndictionary of just Cloud Concepts\nbut the kicker is each concept can be no\nlonger than 256. I might make it like\n512 characters\nso the whole theme will be like Cloud\nConcepts explained in less than 512\ncharacters or something like that right\nuh I only put in two there for for at\nthe moment but the whole essentially the\nwhole API is like written out too so\nohwhat's it called insomnia the API thingumso if I do like get\nmy blanket is there\nif I want to like add a new one uh I\ndon't need to put an i uh post\nlet's see put we can do post but I don't\nneed to provide and\nID here I could just provide like all\nthese other things\nso I could say like containeruh what is a container uh\nactually you know a definition I know\neasily serverless serverless is\num\na compute model where you don't uh where\nthe\ninfrastructure is infrastruct structure\nis managed by\nthe platform platform boom\nand then I could just find like some\ndocumentation on serverless\nsome sort of page\nuh we'll just do this one hereI need docs I don't want like uhI want uh\nso where's the docs page here\ndeveloper guide nosir let'soh my goodness how is it so hard\nto find the docs page for a serverlessah here we go\nyou know what we'll just put this\nfor now\nthis is all dummy data anyway so it\ndoesn't really make a difference\nso we'll do that all rightso if I send this to my definition I hit\nsendit didn't accept no oh I forgot that\nprovided tag\noh hold on I know what I did wrong here\nbecause\nmy function here so let's lower this\nhereaction that is for my post so where's my\npost here create this is\nposts\ncreate definition is asking for these\nseparately oh come on all right so then\nthat should be I need to update that\nthough because it shouldn't be that way\nso this would be likeauthor name\nand then author\nwhat are we asking for author URLauthor URL and then we'll have this here\nbeautify that Json\nand then you know before I\ninsert this we can delete this one\nif I provide\nwait is a delete working with the ID or\nthe word let's see post delete is\nworking with the word\nI need to change that too\nserver\nsure\nserverless send\nwhat that didn't work either\nhold onwhere is my consoleexecuting serverless okay oh my goodness\nso it is working with the ID\nall right where let's grab all of these\nwe're serverless here\nso then if I call my delete here\nokay that worked so now if I do a get\nget them all\nit's gone so now if I do a post\nit's oh I still didn't add a tag oh my\ngoodness Gwen come on so the good thing\nabout\nwhen I have created UI is that I can add\nall this validation in it so I don't\nforget what I have to keep adding but\nthen we got to do the same thing so tag\nwould be like I don't know compute\nall right\nso then I need to delete this one so I\ngotta delete\nthis one send and then get\nall right serverless is gone and then\npostwhat happened this did not postoh do I not have a tag in the\ncreate create definition\nI don't have a tag here all right cool\nso there's a bunch of things we need to\nchange here\nuh\nwhat does it say hereso like a flash card program of sortsuh\nuh yeah sort of no more like a\ndictionary\nhow long do you work in a normal day uh\n14 hours is add your favorite browser\nyes\ngood luck can you do an internet speed\ntest nostringstring and then here in our delete we\ngotta dohow can I become a Google Cloud engineer\nby working really hard\nstring ID so this is gonna go here\nwe're gonna say oh what was thatmove here string ID string ID\nall right let me check my Repositorywhen I create a new definition that's\nfine coolwhat up everybody\notamaine hello the Rockstar is insomnia\npersonal choice over Postman\nyeah\num I can't remember why I wanted to use\ninsomnia over\nPostman I no idea I can't remember whyI think a postman started to get a\nlittle too like bloated like there's\njust so much going onoh my goodness I keep getting this error\nthat's because\nin my indexuh uh index here I'm asking to load this\nso for here we're just going to load\nnothing here\nfor nowthe goal for this page is to eventually\nhaveum\na random quote up here here but for now\nuh we don't need that\nso I didn't close this also I don't need\nmy front end\nwe just need to run the API now so we'll\ndo thatum Network admin to ad Network admin\ndegree seven years Network admin\nexperience if I get a closer do you\nthink that would be enough to apply for\ncloud jobs\nuh clouds two Cloud search two Cloud\nprojects practicing a ring skills tailor\nyour resume tailor cover letter I think\nyou you should be in a good position\nall right so what I was gonna do was\ndelete thisboomokay\nthen I'm gonna get everything perfect\nthen I'm gonna post this oneoh my goodness did I not why is that not\ngrabbing itgetwhy is it not grabbing the theuhwhat create definition\nstring tag oh come on\ntag equals tag perfect okay cool\nuh restart thatadmin\nhi how you doing what up\neven on days off I work which probably\nnot a good habit but heyall right so we're gonna do get we're\ngonna delete that last one again and see\nif it works now\nso\ndelete this last oneperfect we're gonna get everything and\nthen we're gonna post\nyeah there we go boom perfect\nso now if I do hold onif I go to\ndebug everything we know\nno why doesn't thethe option to oh no no no no stop thatthe multiple projects doesn't come up\nhere come onproperties multiple projects API start\nclient start I don't need to start my\nshared\napply okay\nall rightoh my camera flows hold onall right there we goall right cool\nthat works perfectlyjust wanted to say thanks for your\nadvice information has gotten me to\nlearning and using Cloud for my work\nenvironment that's awesome congrats to\nyou uh happy to be happy to be just a\nsmall partof your Cloud Journey\nyeah something's up with this camera\nlike it keeps freezing I don't know whybut yeah so what I got to do is\nessentially add like a bunch more I\nthink before I make this public\nI want to have at least like 50\ndefinitions\num and then there's a couple of other\nthings that I want to implement\nuh to the actual project itself like it\nlooks hideous right now so\nI want to use this thing called Mud\nBlazer\nmud Blazer\nthis thing hereuh because they have a lot of cool\ncomponents it's like I could probably\nuse like\ntrue\numlike a card let me seeyeah like something like this\nto show off\nthe\nthe quote itself like maybe something\nlike thator something something as simple as this\nlike word definition and then URL oh\nwait because it has an author maybe need\nsomething else thereum yeah so the project structure is\nuh let me stop it\nso this is a Blazer web assembly front\nend so let me show you here\nuh\nour front end here this is a Blazers\nBlazer webassembly project so that's\nall.net our back end our serverless\nfunctions I truly do believe like the\nmajority of things that you want to\nbuild from scratch now in 2022 if you're\nnot trying serverless\nlike I don't know why so so the backing\nis all serverless here uh right now it's\njust like a simple API in this file here\num\nand then we obviously have a shared file\nbetween both of those projects uh with\njust a bunch of models and whatnot\nI want to there's a couple other\nfunctionalities that I want to implement\nbut right now I'm just building a simple\nAPIuh but yeah yeah yeahuh let's try implementing thisthis this this thingwhere'd it gouh let's go hereall right boom was over heremud Blazerso let's implement this in my client\nprojectgetting started\n[Music]uhwait no I don't want to use the\ntemplatesall right so we need to add this packageuh uh where is it\nyou nougat no\nnuget\nI'm relatively new to\nnougat like I'm pretty I usually use vs\ncode so this is like\nthere's like so much I mean I'm\nrelatively new to visual studio I\nusually use\nvs code so oh my gosh that's not the\nright\nhold onlet's just do it in here this like\nthere's so much that you can do in here\noh man\nuh and then we'll just do thatuh browse\nI just want mod Blazer here we go latest\nstable installall right I need to do a refresh for\nserverless hahayeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah serverless\nis serverless is I don't know a lot of\npeople choose to like\nhate on it but\nthese major corporations are using it so\nlearn it uh learn it while you can all\nright so Imports just add this to import\nclient I think Imports is hereall right\numhmm\nindex or layoutfont and style references and index or\nlayout CS HTML index or layout\nwhere is that it's probably here right\nno it's probably in here\nwe go\nso these are\nI think these are\nhere perfect and then we're not going to\nuse this\nthese two anymoreall right uh\nwe need a script reference\nall right script reference boomuh I'm completely new to anything coding\nlanguage I'm gonna watch a video about\nwhich programming language you need to\nlearn awesome\nyou do that I think I said pythonanyone studying for AZ 700 which one is\n700 I don't remember which one that is\nuh removefile you can remember let's see the site\nthat CSS which I think is app.css\nwe can just delete this now\nokay\nand then\nregister services\nall right let's register our servicesprogram at CS probably gonna have to do\nit here\nand then this one goes up hereboom uhI'm the opposite for me I used to visual\nstudio in college and I'm going to use\nthe visual code\nyeah my uh actually I use Visual Studio\nwhen I was uhwhen I was in my cloud engineering gig\nbecause they were a c-sharp.net shop but\nthey were doing like\nclassic.net stuffbut I was developing the functions and\nserverless stuff all in umoh my camera froze again come onhello uh but but there we go one twoI don't know why this thing keeps\nfreezing I'm probably gonna have to get\noff and figure it out uh is it yeah but\nyeah I was using visual studio code for\nall the umfunctions and serverless stuff\nbecause it works pretty welluh ad components that's just to\nmain.layout dot Razer main.layout dot\nRazer\nmain dot layout dot razoruh should be in\nshared I mean eraserthereis it free to use like for small\nprojects to learn what's free to use\nwhat do you what are you asking\nall right and then\nis that it is that everything with that\nlet's start itbut I've been enjoying Visual Studio\nI think for debugging like these types\nof projects it's been\nit's been a lot of fun what is going on\nhereI literally don't see anythingto running it's like nothing hereah the layout got messed up let's see\nwhat happened here\nall right\nuh ready for more we did that\nwe did thatwe did that\nthat was just sixoh maybe I wasn't supposed to erase all\nthis\nmaybe I just needed to copy this in here\nall right\nlet's do that\nserverless Azure functions has a million\nexecution executions for free\nper subscription per why does this look\nlike this the heck\numokay someone looks different so\nyes\nessentially the compute is free if you\nuse storage and whatnot but it's still\ngoing to be like pennies you know\nespecially for smaller projects\nall right\nso do they have like uh\nthey have they have wireframes okay coollet's do this like how do I copy this\nno no maybe not that one maybe like\nmain layouts okay let's do this\nman\nuh\nuh like this layout hold onokay I like this layout so\nlet's cut this is\nthis is the main layout\nall right let's try thatoh come onobject of type okay let's see what's\ngoing on here\noh these are commented out that's whyall rightwhat else is going on hereall right so how was it before let's see\nlet's copy this here it's at bodyso at body should workand then uhnow\nnav menubut oh okay hold on I think I shouldn't\nhave erased\nthis\nuh there\nand then do that and then I can delete\nthis\nright\nand then this is nav menu\nnav menuthere we gookay everything looks weirdoh wait that looks different now hold onokay\ndata\nall rightstatic web apps the heck is this\nthis doesn't need to be here\nI think we didn't likethere's some sort of CSS that's still\npretty weird here but we'll take a look\nin a secondum what was it here\nso that's good that's fine\nmobilizers does are we not supposed to\nuse thisuh all right so anywaythat's that so if I grab like\nI feel like you do this one hereoh my goodness there's so much hereall right\nit's full screen this hereso I'm supposed to be able to grab this\ncomponent\nand then let's swap out my fetch dataoh I think I know I was supposed to\ndelete this\nokay so we'll swap just swap out my\nfetch data but\nwe need this still so\nwhat we don't need is all of thisthat okayso that's our componentand\nno but we still should do okay never\nmind we should do this instead\nand then just put it inside the else\nyeah yeah yeah\nbecause if it's null we don't want\nanything to load and we don't need this\nmany we just need one because we're\ngoing to do a four each\nlike Loop uh through it soum\nlet me see let me see one cardoh items okay coolso I can delete all one item\nsecond item\nthereall right so that's just one item\nsignificantly less\nbut we can do\nfor each\nmod card my card header Mark cart item\nMark cart grid so we probably need to do\na 4H here so for eachVAR uh definition in Def\nNations we're gonna do this\nactually we're gonna close all\nmy items here\nformat this\nformat\ndocument\nI have to do a at symbol here boomdo you work for fun yes I absolutely do\nwork for fun I love what I do for work\nuh okay so let's format that once again\ncool so for each uh card me\ncard head content we could make this\nlike at definition\ndefinition dot word boom\nuh\nwell what does the layout look likeso we could just make this the word\nand then hear the definition and then\nthe button can have like\na link to the a link to the URL or\nsomething like that\nright\nso we don't need any of these\nfor now I'm just going to erase those\nfor now so I don't know what these are\ncalled but I'm going to erase themuh they were like\nunlimited yeah so I don't need D I don't\nneed this\nthis hereand what is the monthly part\nI don't need the monthly part either\nso I can erase this is whaleand then I need the\nactual definition itself\nwait now let me see so beginner the five\nwhere's the five dollarstart now is the button\nall right so I'm gonna put here\ndefinition not content\nand then start now is going to be\nlearn more and then the href here\nuh snow href\nI think we'll have to do it like\nhref is going to equal at\na definition Dot\nlearn more URL\nperfect let's see what this happenswhat up Athena how you doingaha I worked\nso we got the word and then we got the\ndefinition if I click learn more it\ntakes me to the docs look at that\nperfect so\nthis looks like trash though but\nuh I gotta fix but it looks a lot better\nthan what it was looking like beforeum\nso I want to add like\na little tag here because remember each\none has\na category that it belongs to and then\nobviously this text has to be smaller\nthan that\nand then I don't need to have these here\nor this up here so let's remove that\nstuff here\nah and the cool thing is that there's\nhot reload so if Icome on I can't move this over okay\nso if I like erase this\nand hit save it should\nthere we go automatically do it without\nme having to launch it againuh cool and then I also don't wantoh hold on this is just I don't have big\nenough screen to do that\nso I also don't want\nuh this I don't need this eitherwait continue editingwhat's wrong with this oh I have to all\nright rebuild that apply changes what\nare consider entry-level Cloud jobs\nCloud support Cloud analysts Cloud\num\nsysadmin why is this still here\num\nand I don't want this to be open by the\ndefault\nso let me change thatso that's probably like a toggle here\nhold on\ndudeuh\nhow do I how do I toggle thatoh that's gotta be like the layout rightoh here we go boomand where is that coming in from here so\nI don't need this here\nall right let's run that\nclass blower Cal admins uh sis admin\nCloud analysts\nthere we go cleaner Dutch datalovely okay cool\nso let's look at their docs because\nthat's how you learn things\nlet's go to\nlike their typography\nuh here we go\nno I need like\noh here we gono I need to know like oh here we go\nuh nobody body one but they don't have like\nexamplesuh like\nfield no\nI need like examples text fieldthis oneno components they have like text here\noh here oh here we go niceso I guess the word itself can be like\nan H3 or maybe an H4 and then the\ndefinition can be like a body body too\nlet's do like a body too\nso I have too many of these open I don't\nneed this here this here\nthis this this this this this\nthis all right so I don't need this open\neither I don't need this open either\nDutch data I'm gonna do H I think we\nsaid H3 for the word and then\nuh body two\nbody two for that\nhey GPS working on my cloud resume\nchallenge right now got you in the\nbackground thanks for the motivation\nlet's go Patrick\nappreciate you watchingum\nlet me know if you get stuck be happy to\nhelp all right that's way too big\nI thought we said that was the right\nsize let's see let's go over here\nlet's do H5 I thought I did do H5please tell me that I'll refresh without\nme having to nice\nvery very much more clean like that\nso let's add the tags with some other\ntype of\nelementum\nso let's look\nuh now Avatar\nthat's cool but\nI don't think that's like what I want\nbadge no\nbuttons no card\nno that's what I'm using right yeah\nCarousel charts\nI would like to at some point have\ncharts where it's like this has been the\nmost popular word looked at for this\npast week or something like that\num but that's not what I want\nright now\noh cool all right so\nlet's make it like primary like how do I\ndo like primary trip\ncolor\nprimary\nthat's this one right yeah all right so\nthen we can put that in\nuh where do we want to put it\nso let's stop thislet's do it definition to content\nbeneath the content\nand then the thingy here the value would\nbe at\ndefinitiondot dot oh my goodness dot tag\nboomadd definition dot tag\nuh tags with a capital all rightlet's seeoh that looks terrible\nand also with it being the same colorI don't like that but Okay cool so let's\npick a different coloruh where is itoh that might be nicer a smaller onelabels\noh uh\nI might like this better hold on let's\nsee\nyeah that might be betterthey will label chips use the default\ntheme border radius oh and we can make\nthem smaller too that might be better\nso let's do let's do different color\nlet's do us like uh like this primary\nuh\nlike let's do this one herelet's go over here and then replaceyou should replace the contentthen erase this one and then apparently\nwe can also make this smaller by\nselecting the right size herelet's make it small\ncopy thisall right uh we have to restart thiswhere to goI didn't restartoh that looks nicer\nit still is like\nlike too close to this like I think they\nhave um like a spacing element that you\ncan use\noh a divider might be niceyeah like this that looks nicewhat is it did you do my my dividerall right let's\nstop this\nand then we wanted it between these two\nhereall right y'all oh you know what I'm\ntired of like moving let's just embed\nthis element in the index for right now\nuh\nlet's just do load fetch data\nfor now because\nif not I'm going to keep having to go\ninto the page and I don't want to do\nthatoh see that looks cleaner\nnow we also need to add the author like\num the name of the author hereum\nI don't know how I'm gonna do that\nbecause\nlike ideally so I want to make it an\nopen source project where\nlike there's going to be a feature where\nyou can be like submit your own\ndefinition and it'll ask you to like you\nknow type in the word the definition\nyour URL in the link and then I'll run\nthat through cognitive Services as like\na first pass to make sure there's no\nfoul language to make sort of some\nnegative content\num and then I'll have it go like\nmanually to like blob storage or\nsomething like that\num so I can review it and then once I\nhit like okay I'll have a function that\nwill automatically publish it to the\ndatabase\nbut a lot of the initial definitions are\ngoing to be just\nfrom my uh end so I don't know if I want\nto say a show like author\nauthor here because that's going to be\nlike my name a lot but I think it would\nbe cool open source contributions for\npeople who are like just getting started\nand whatnotuh so what is something else so let's\nadd like another definition though\nlet's do Post let's call let's do um\nwhat's another Cloud uh let's do like\napplication\napplication security Let's do an\napplication Security Groupa group of rules uh no no\na way of grouping\nvirtual machinesuh via their app like\nlocations\nyeah there there actually we'll do the\nother purpose via their purpose\nyou can set your\nnetwork security boob desk uh\ndestination\nand source\nto be an application Security Group\napplication Security Group\nuh\nwe can do like oh you know what we\nshould have like abbreviation too\nas\nG G's r\naway\nBears machines via their purpose your\npurpose and\nuh\nand you can there we go\nthis would be like networkingyeah something like that\nwe should have abbreviations because\nlike\noftentimes that's the issue like when\nyou're getting started you hear like AKs\nNSG asglb\num\nI don't know\nf-a-a-s-p-a-pes yes like you hear all\nthese things so like one day you go to\nlike the cloud dictionary you're like\nwhat is NSG and then like it pulls it up\nvia abbreviation oh my goodness let's do\nthat\nlet's we're going to do this now so\nokay cool I love the I love this idea I\nlove it all right so we're gonna hit\npost\nand then I'm gonna get everythinguh and then what we're gonna do is add\nabbreviations so let's update\nwe're gonna update our modeland then we update the date individuallyyeah yeah this is such a oh I love when\nthese ideas come like like yes such a\nfreaking good idea all right so now\nsince I've updated the API I can do\nrefresh here and it should automatically\npull in another thingy there\nso\nlet me think hereah\nall right let's do thisso what I'm going to do now is create an\nabbreviation and then we could put the\nabbreviation right under the thingy\nunder the definition\nlike in maybe like in like a caption\ntype typography\nor size\num but for that I need to update my\nmodel firstso we have to go to shared\ndefinition model and then in here we're\ngonna have\nuh\nI can call this\nuh Brie V Asian\nuh abbreviation and then this will need\nto be a capital\ncool\nand then this can be a null because not\neverything is going to be have\nabbreviation\nuh cool so and then our repository\nthat's fine\nour function itself should need to\nchange because we're retrieving the\nentire collection\nlet's see definitionsget get\ndefinitions yeah that shouldn't\nokay but when we are creating we do need\nto providestring uh breviation\nall right\nso then when we add abbreviation perfect\nlove it so that's for creating and then\nwhen we update we need to do the same\nexisting\ndefinition dot abbreviation equals\nabbreviation\noh I forgot to add thestring abbreviation deviation oh\nabbreviation\nstring tag as well because I don't have\nthat in there\nthen string of variation equals\nabbreviation\nand then existing tag equals look at it\nfilling in for me all right cool so\nthat's for updating all right sweet so\nnow I have to grab all the elements and\nthen add abbreviations to them if they\nhave them\nand then showcase them there\nuhyeah so now let's run everythingeveryone do me a favor hit a like on\nthis on the Stream\num I'm gonna answer little questions a\nlittle later\nI just got sucked into working on this\nproject that I enjoy that I'm enjoying\nso I don't know why there's space up\nhere I don't like that but we'll figure\nthat out later\nso now we're gonna go in here and then\nwe're gonna grab like for example\nI think we've put\nworks of\nI just uh grab this hold on getuh abbreviation oh my goodness I made a\ntypo where\nwhere\nnot hereuh not here I did it in\nabbreviation ah here we go abbreviation\nthank you very much\nI gotta stop this though\nwell look at those Keen eyes\nabbreviation\nlovely\ndid I do it right in the models and\nwhatnot\nyeah because we're calling the\nabbreviation that's goodall right we're good right abbreviation\nis double is double byeah it's fine okay cool I was just\nchecking all right so now what we're\ngonna do isupdate so I need to make individual\nfunctions so I can update specific\nproperties but right now I'm just gonna\ndo like update all the properties\nso we're gonna get all of our thingies\nand then we're gonna update see all\nthese are null abbreviations right so\nI'm going to do is like grab\nthis one and put it into a put request\nbecause put will update it\nbut put needs the ID I believe right\nput Works off the ID definition\nupdate yeah we just need the ID okay so\nthat's the ID we don't need to update\nthe ID\nbut application security group that have\na does have an abbreviation which would\nbeASG\nuhthat's notapplications Security Groupoh I feel like I'm\ndoing so many Azure ones maybe that\ncould be a tag too though\nthat's a good idea like it'll be like oh\nthis is specific to azure\neven though all clouds use it they just\ncall them different thingsit would make my life so much easier if\nthey all called it the same thingokay cool\nso if I do send that and then I do get\neverythingnetworks oh no I made another mistake\nall right we're going to do this again\noh wait so we're just gonna go put\nI need again I need to change\nthem so it accepts Json the way it\nreturns it\nauthor name I think this is author\nURL okay there we goboomall rightokay so now if I do get\nall right fantastic the other one that\nhas\nload balancers also have abbreviations I\nbelieve which is lbso we're going to grab this one and then\nupdate it\nor definition\nuh we need to remove this arrayabbreviation would be\nlbthere's one more on the line where you\nhave to scroll over to the right oh now\nmy camera froze again goshall right there we gouh uh all right cool cool cool I'll be\nthere username author this is author\nname author nameauthor url url url you are\nURL there we go send\nand if we do getit soon our security group load balancer\nall right let's do this network security\ngroup one\nuh uh putsso for the ones that don't haveuh abbreviations\nI wonder ifit'll give me an issuelike when displaying it in the componentnetwork security group is Network\nSecurity Group I gotta figure out what's\nwrong with my camera\nforeign\nso anyway beautify other Jason send it\nget\nall right\nwait whatI replaced the wrong one\nwait no did II never excuse yeah I probably replaced\nthe wrong one all right whatever now we\nhave this one twice\nI can't remember what it replaced\nbut we'll delete this oneget all right so we have application\nSecurity Group\nuh Network Security Groupand then we have serverless which\ndoesn't have his own abbreviation all\nright\nso if we go here we should only have\nthree\nI lost one network security group\nserverless oh I lost load balancerall right so apparently there's another\none\nuh Brie abbreviationI don't see I know every VA\nuh really a a brevi a\nI don't see it anywhere\nwhere\nall the way to the right I'm looking at\nso down here every V8 abbreviation\nabbreviation I feel like I got it right\nno\nabbreviation\nabbreviationI think I got it right okay cool\nokaytwo B's in abbreviation yeah\n2B is an abbreviation\nall right so now we'll go to fetch data\nor stop everything here\nand then what we're going to do is we're\ngonna put like a really small oneon\nlike here so we'll use like\nuhI don't know caption text caption text\nlike this hereso under the word\nand then here we'll just call this at\ndefinition\ndot uh abbreviation\nthere\nall right let's see what this does\ntwo bees for a second I thought this is\nbe 2bs\nand I was like what's BS\nah nice so it's really small but it's\nhere they're coming in here so that's\ngood\nso\nso I like that\nbut we have to we just have to center it\nbut I don't know I'm gonna worry about\nlike that in a little bit\noh these have links too so like you can\nlink click on these as well\nthat's nice all right so let me add\nanother one hold on\npost word we're gonna call it do I have\nload balancer saved in any of these\nserverless application group I don'tno okayall right we're gonna call this load\nbalance\nbalancer\nuh\na load balancerdistributes incoming\nNetwork traffic\namongst a group is that how you spell\namongst\nprobably notuh\nuh amongstyes it is wow look at me\nwait no it was over hereoh no totally didn't amongst\na group of\nvirtual machines\nyou know what I just thought about this\nwhen we reference a concept in another\nconcept that should be linked to that so\nyou can click on that and be taken oh my\ngosh look at me\na group of virtual machines a group of\namongst a group of virtual machines\nuh or resources\nbecause it could be like something else\nbesides Rich machines I mean at the end\nof the day everything's a virtual\nmachine right\nuh and then\nI don't know what the URL for load\nbalancers is\nload balancer azureokay cooluh no here tag networkingand then we move localizationsweetoh my goodness again I didn't provideuh\nthereI didn't provide abbreviationuh abbreviation uh breviation\nshould be lb abbreviation\nget\nall right Coolio\nand then\nwhere is my website herenice all right cool cool let's switch to\nuh\nlet me let me pull this up one secondall right so that was a significant\namount that I wanted to get done todaywhich is good\nbut yeah this thing mud Blazer makes it\nso easy so easy to like not have to\nworry about\nmaking things look nice\nuh I once heard someone complain that\nlike all Blazer Pages look\nlike Blazer apps look similar and I'm\nlike I don't necessarily\ncare if it looked similar I just like\nthere's the fact that I don't have to do\nany work like any hard work to get it to\nwork or get it to alert look decently\nit's awesomeso yeah anyway\nI have a name\nfor the project I I have the domain\nalready but it's cool because it's a DOT\ncloud\ndomain and then it's going to be dot\nCloud slash whatever the word is so dot\nCloud slash load balancer dot Cloud\nslash\num oh maybe the Slugs can be\nabbreviations if they have it if not\nit'll be the fruit maybe a full word\nwould be easier\nyeah okay\nlet's think about but anyway we've hung\nout for an hour\nuh I'm gonna go and actually spend my\nday off chilling but I'll see y'all\nlater",
