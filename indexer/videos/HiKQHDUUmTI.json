  "transcript": "hey what's going on everybody so uh\nwe're doing this series with chloe\ncondon who is a senior cloud advocate at\nmicrosoft we're on actually the same\nteam which is pretty great\nand we're doing this whole series where\nwe're covering resumes and cover letters\nand all that kind of stuff that you need\nto apply for jobs it's called how can i\nhelp i'll have a little link\ninformation so you can attend as well\nin the description but the point of this\nvideo is to sort of react or roast my\nresume from 2019\nbecause uh i don't know i feel like it's\nit's it's it could be like a therapeutic\nactivity that i could do and maybe if\nanything stands out\nfor you all it'll help you perfect um i\ndid sort of go into this on stream on\nour first session for the series that i\njust mentioned so i can link to that so\ny'all can watch that as well\nbut yeah let's let's dive into it oh hi\ni'm gps and welcome to a new video\nfor initial thoughts when i opened this\nand i was like blurring things out i'm\nlike wow this is super short\nbut i've always liked one pagers because\num and this was an assumption i had\nbefore i actually knew it was a fact\npeople really only take less than a\nminute i think chloe on stream was\nmentioning it's like the first 10\nseconds they look at your resume and\nthey're like is it worth looking into or\nnot\nand if they see like a bunch a bunch a\nbunch a bunch pages it's pretty much\ngonna it sort of comes off as like\nthere's a lot of fluff right\ni used to think that i was very arrogant\nfor having a one page resume but it's\nworked in my favor so here we are\nname nice and big and then i had my\nyoutube channel right away i also have\nmy email and my phone number here\nbut i knew at that point i had a bunch\nof videos and tutorials and all that\nkind of stuff on my youtube and a lot of\nthose showcased my not only who i am as\na person and my ability to communicate\nthings but also my technical skill set\nbecause a lot of my videos were on azure\nfunctions and azure in general\nthen we have certifications yeah i get\nthis question a lot like which search do\nyou have at this point i was already a\ncall engineer that was my current role\nand i had only had the aws certified\ndeveloper associate\nthat's literally all i had\nand then we dive into employment history\nagain i don't have any\ni guess substantial\ncollege education or educate or like\nboot camps or any programs or anything\nlike that besides certifications so i\njust have certifications and employment\nhistory in here too\noh let's start from the bottom of\nemployment history because usually you\ngo in like um\nlike a timeline like the most recent one\nyou put on top but let's go from the\nbottom because\nthat was my first gig i guess ever like\nlegal job on paper was the the the one\nat the apple store i was a technical\nspecialist\nand i guess i summarized my entire time\nwhich was about a year and a half there\num in three bullet points so resolved\nmac os ios and icloud issues repaired\nreplace installed mac desktops laptop\nmobile device components answered apple\nproduct technical support questions in\nenglish and spanish looking back i would\nhave added one more here that's that\nwould have been like\ndocumented issues or or created tickets\nof like customer issues\nuh for every single\ni don't know like\nencounter whatever every single customer\nthat came in because\ni remember at the apple store gig\nevery person who would come in and we\nwould have like these appointments like\noh i need to fix this every single issue\nwas a ticket and there was a lot of\ndocumentation and triage that would be\nput into those tickets and that was\nextremely extremely valuable for for my\nhelp desk gig so i should have put that\nin there uh but yeah that's overall that\nsome sums it up pretty nice and maybe\nthings like um\nparticipated in training or something\nlike that would have been great too but\nuh i mean i guess didn't hold me back\nthen we got my helpdesk gig that i was\nthere for wow two years\nprovided frontline technical support to\nend users on time according to sla\nassisted in relocating facilities\nsetting up most i.t infrastructure\noffice 365 administration and documented\nit tasks of general interest for\ninternal users so i think what was key i\nmean all this was key for my sysadmin\ngig later on but really this office 365\nadministration um\nlike popped out for\nfor my the person who hired me for this\none and i know this because i asked this\nperson so\nuh the the certification i know uh like\nhelped my resume at that point um\nbut keep in mind that was like\n2018 yeah 2018. so a couple years ago um\nand\nactually hold on where are we yes right\nhere so office 365 administration\nbecause these were things like\nuh creating users updating\npermissions and all kinds of things\nand then also the frontline technical\nsupport to end users according to sla\nwas important to this sysadmin uh gig\nbecause again since it's an operation\nrole and you're sort of\nuh working for be like vr requests and\nthings like that\nbeing familiar with those kinds of\nthings in terms of like\nhow to handle when people approach you\nor how to handle requests over the phone\nand things like that\nit definitely helped here\nuh and again document documented it\ntasks of general interest for internal\nusers\nand then the doc if i had added that\nhere you can see that there's a\nconsistent\nlike very important thing that i've been\ndoing for years since this gig 2014\nwhich is documentation\num all right so that was this that's the\nhelpdesk gig then i landed the sysadmin\ngig and this is where i was exposed to\nazure in my life to azure\nmy life was introduced to azure or azure\nwas introduced in my life whatever um\nhere at atlassian suite administration\nso this was things like creating\nworkflows in jira\ncreating custom reports and dashboards\nuh using jira for you know my own\nticketing system\num\nuh what else was done there oh using\njira for also for like\nlike\nagile and sprints and things like that\nyeah so\nuh not only was i using it to document\nmy work uh with confluence but also\nto\nyou know\nfor the ticketing system and then also\nfor the sprints and stuff like that so i\nhad like a lot of jerry experience in or\nat lasting sweet because the last scene\nis confluence jira and i think like a\nbunch of other things\nbut yeah\noffice 365 administration this was uh\neven like creating users and onboarding\nand all that kind of stuff but i\nremember i was personally like automated\nthat it was done being done all manually\nand then when i got here i automated it\nwith a powershell so it was great that\nwas like my first\nactually i might have done some\npowershell here but i think it was like\ndefinitely solidified up here\nprovided frontline technical support to\nend users again this is consistent here\nand then here scripted manual tests\nusing powershell and python yeah see\nagain that's the office 365 and then\npython i used later for some um azure\nstuff that i\nthat i uh had created we can dive into\nthat a little bit later\ndocuments i t tasks of general interest\nfor internal users actually just copied\nthis\nover here uh assisted with cloud\ninfrastructure tasks i think in here\num i would have like erased these two\nand then gone a little bit more specific\ninto what tasks\ni worked on or maybe like projects\nbut overall not too bad\nuh cloud engineer currently primarily\nuse um\nnet and serverless tools to write cloud\napplications that save the company money\nand colleagues time\ndeploy architect administrate and\nmonitor solutions and infrastructure and\nazure shortened development life cycles\nand time to market by building and\nmaintaining safety and pipelines and\nazure devops create documentation on my\nwork and present company present company\nwide participate in daily scrum meetings\nand weekly check-ins with my supervisor\ntricksters okay so not bad but i think i\nwould have removed so i would have\nremoved one\ni think i would remove these three and\nactually provided examples of projects\nthat i implemented because at this point\nactually i don't remember exactly when i\ncreated this resume but i'm sure i would\nhave had like some solid projects under\nmy belt by then and i would have more\nlike written something like um\ncreated\napplication or or architecture solution\nwhatever it might be project\nwith uh\nazure functions that save the company\nthis month this many hours this much\nmoney and what i've dived in a little\nlike an extra bullet point there that\nwould have said like\nimplemented with this technology and\nthat kind of stuff so so at this point i\nthink it would have been more valuable\nto share\nthe projects themselves than the actual\nlike sort of these just like generic and\ngeneral things\num i also don't have an area here for\nprojects that i've done on the side i\ndon't think i had many like the amount\nthat i have now\nuh like on my github and things like\nthat but\nfor example i would have had like let's\ngo to my github right now\nand let's go to my repos\nand i would have added something like i\nthink\na good project would have been that's\nprobably a little too\noh like the resume my resume challenge\nthing i would have added this thing here\nand then of course i would add my\nuh like my my my self-talk guide and\nthen\nwhat's another one that i have\nmaybe yeah let's use those three so like\nmy\nuh resume challenge how i like you know\nbecause there's architecture here\nprereqs that you need all those kinds of\nstuff all those kinds of things are in\nhere\nand i would have added that one i would\nhave added this daily positive news sms\nserverless project that i made because i\nremember documenting this well how to\nset up your code environment api\ncredentials package use set up all the\nkinds of things that you need to do to\nrun it um it's all in here as well so i\nwould have added that to my projects\nsection of my resume\nand then\nmy self-taught guide to cloud computing\nalso\nthis more speaks to like i guess my way\nof documenting and commuting commute\nyeah communicating things right so i\nwould have added that to my resume so i\nprobably would have removed so if i had\nto update this resume now which i don't\ni'm surprised i don't have an updated\nversion or maybe this is something we'll\ndo on stream that would be great\ni would probably remove this last one um\nmaybe even this service desk analyst one\nthese last two and just put projects\nthere\nbut besides that i think it's pretty\nsolid all right so um yeah that was my\nresume back in 2019\ni don't necessarily think it was great i\ndon't think it's too like it's hideous\nor bad it's terrible um you can tell\nthat i'm just like straightforward i'm\nthere's not a lot of fluff i'm like kind\nof what you see is what you get and i\nthink employers like\nhave value that\num\nyeah there's not like a lot of buzzwords\nor things like that or like you know\npeople will put like skills like\nuh hiking or something like that for\nwhatever reason um yeah so that i enjoy\nuh there are now things that i look back\ni'm like i could have done this way\nbetter um but maybe we'll get my resume\nmakeover on stream or something like\nthat\nanyway uh\nyeah if you have any questions let me\nknow and i'll do a video on them or\nsomething i don't know alright see you\non the next one",
