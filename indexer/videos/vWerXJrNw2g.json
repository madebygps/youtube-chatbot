  "title": "From Zero to Cloud Engineer in 6 months",
  "transcript": "so i've been in tech since 2014 help\ndesk sysadmin cloud engineer training\narchitect and now a cloud advocate at\nmicrosoft i don't have a college degree\nbut i do have experience and this is\nexactly how i would learn to become a\ncloud engineer in 2022 i think there are\nfour phases linux and networking\nprogramming cloud platform and devops\npractices if you are completely new to\ntech in general but you spend every\nsingle day studying and you really grind\nit out i do believe that you could gain\nthe entire skill set that you need to go\nfrom zero to a junior cloud engineer\nskill set in about six months to a year\ndepends on how much time you put into it\nfor each phase i'm going to tell you why\nit matters some resources that i've used\nthat i would recommend some tasks you\nshould be able to accomplish and maybe\nsome project ideas the order of phases\nthat i told you is the one that i would\nfollow and if you prefer text you can go\nto learn to cloud.guide which is a guide\ni put together it's free it's open\nsource available on github with a couple\nof other friends and it's just based on\nour experience learning cloud and\nthere's a lot more sort of content and\nguide info there than i could cover in\nthis video uh but yeah with all that\nbeing said hi i'm gps and welcome to a\nnew video phase one linux and networking\nthe reason i put these two together is\nbecause the cloud is just a bunch of\nlinux servers that are networked\ntogether so obviously having a\nfoundation in both of those topics is\npretty crucial now individually they are\ncareers and specialties entirely on\ntheir own so you're not expected to\nbecome a professional in either one or\nboth right just you know gaining a fun\nfoundational knowledge is fantastic and\nbecoming comfortable with a command\ncommand line terminal things like that\nit's all what linux administration is\nand a lot of networking tasks are also\naccomplished via commands so you get\nsort of your best of both worlds when\nyou become comfortable with the command\nline and moving into programming moving\ninto\nthe cloud platform section moving into\ndevops practices all of those are going\nto use commands to accomplish tasks so\nif you sort of start with it you're\ngoing to set yourself up for success\ncommands like you know cd command to\nchange directories ls command to list\nthings you know create files copy files\nmove files with make deer copy remove\ntouch you know find things with a locate\nwhere is which find um understanding how\nto get more help on commands that you're\nusing with the man man pages and the\nlike help commands um being familiar\nwith how to view logs in the like var\nlog directory and how to display the\ncontent of files with cat less more tail\nusing grep using set to filter your\noutput\nhow to use pipelines with the pipe\noperator how to put pipelines together\nwith the pipe operator\nhow to use nano and vam to manipulate\nfiles how to install packages how to\ntake a look at processes that uses\nprocesses on your server\nwith uh what's like ps top nice kill\nthese are commands\num there's a couple of other things uh\ni'll sort of like pause here and you can\ntake a look at what things that i\nusually recommend\num but my absolute favorite resource for\nlearning linux was is this book called\nlinux basic for hackers specifically the\nfirst 11 chapters i have blog posts\naround this content that i learned as\nwell on madebygps.com so you can go to\nthe linux tab you can take a look there\nbut the first 11 chapters of that book\nfantastic it's such an engaging way to\nlearn it is focused a little bit more on\ntasks that are security related but\ntrust me you're going to learn\neverything that you need to learn in\nterms of becoming comfortable with linux\nfor networking there's this course\ncalled i think it's called computer\nnetworking course on free code camp it\nis about 10 hours long but if you like\nto exit or one and a half um you'll get\nthrough it obviously quicker and there\nis a lot of information there it could\nbe a little overwhelming but if you\nspread your time over uh you know like a\ncouple of weeks you'll learn a lot there\nconcepts that are important for cloud is\nyou know understanding how to put\ntogether virtual networks and how to\norganize your network with subnets and\nand\nusing private ip addresses public iep\naddresses uh different sort of ways of\nsetting up networks things like that\nwhich you'll learn when you go through\nthis course\ni think the free codecam course is free\ni think actually it is free it's on\nyoutube and then the book is not free\nbut it's relatively inexpensive in my\nopinion with um\nin terms of like how much content is\nactually in that stuff right\nso some project ideas that you could do\nis\nthe most obvious and the first one you\nshould definitely do is install linux on\na vm you can use something like\nvirtualbox\nor install it on maybe a spare computer\nor something like that\nif you need help picking a distro i\nrecommend pop os i love pop os\nbut you could pick anything out there\nright and try you could also try\ndeploying your own cloud there's this\nthing called next cloud\ni recently did it for myself it's pretty\ngreat it's like an alternative to stuff\nlike google drive onedrive and things\nlike that\nand you can deploy that on your own\ncomputer and your own vm give that a try\nyou'd also try deploying your own nas\nserver with freenas\nthere's like so many fun things that you\ncan do in terms of linux and networking\nrealms so give those a try also the book\nand the course\nthe book and the video course i\nrecommend will also have some project\nideas to go through those as well all\nright let's move on to phase two\nprogramming\nalrighty so when it comes to cloud there\nare actually full\nroles that are dedicated dedicated\ndedicated 100 to cloud development where\nyou will be building full-on\napplications\nand you will need to understand how to\nprogram absolutely everything but when\nit comes to cloud engineering cloud\nadministration\nyou will be utilizing code but more in\nthe context of automating your tasks and\nsort of building scripts\nand eventually building like\ninfrastructure as code to\ndeploy your stuff to the cloud now this\ndoesn't mean that you don't need to\nlearn to program i personally believe\nthat if you pick up a language like\npython and understand your basics like\nvariables functions um you know when to\nuse arrays lists dictionaries basic data\ntypes uh strings booleans things like\nthat iterations for loops um\neven things like understanding uh how to\ntest your code and why it's important\nand then some like uh object oriented\nprogramming concepts so like your\nfundamentals when you're learning any\nprogramming language\nwill highly highly benefit you now you\ndon't need to go\nmore in depth into into those things but\nyou know\non a pick up a learn to python course\nthere are so many python books out there\ni think they're a few that i can name is\num like a python crash course book an\nintroduction to oh no automate the\nboring with python is also a fantastic\nbook free code camp has also a learn\npython course\nnow i personally don't use python but it\nis a very beginner friendly language and\nit's used so much a lot of the job\nlistings out there ask for python skills\nso as a beginner i would recommend that\nfor you and there's a lot of community\nthere's a lot of content out there too\nagain once you learn the fundamentals\nsort of translating that into another\nlanguage if you need to pick up another\nlanguage will be a lot easier\nbut as a beginner go for python okay now\none thing i wanted to add is\nuh in the previous step you would have\nbeen introduced to bash scripting bash\nis almost like a universal programming\nlanguage\nalmost every single linux server that\nyou're going to deploy up deploy out\nthere will have bash available without\nhaving to install and there's no other\nlanguage out there that has that same\ncapability right\nso becoming familiar with you know using\ncommands and putting together in a bash\nscript and writing bash groups is also\nvery powerful right um there are other\nthings that you could learn like\npowershell you know bash powershell\npython i know go is very popular uh rust\nand all these kinds of things but again\ni want you to focus on being a beginner\nand utilizing community content all to\nyour favor because when you're getting\nstarted you're going to be overwhelmed\nright\nso that's why i recommend python in\nterms of projects all the resources that\ni've mentioned will have projects for\nyou to do\nso just lean into those you could also\ndo things like i don't know create like\na score tracker where you type in the\nname you make like a command line\nprogram with python type in the name of\na team it'll give you like the um scores\nlike the last game that that team played\nthe score of that game uh do make sure\nyou create a github profile and create a\nreadme where you just introduce yourself\num just you know google what that means\nuh github profile is where you're going\nto showcase all of the things that you\ncreate and a readme is the space that\nyou get to sort of describe or provide\ninformation into what that project is\nset itself up set that self set yourself\nup for success by creating one of those\num and yeah i think that's it for this\nphase now let's move into phase number\nthree cloud platform all right and you\nmight be thinking like hey i want to\nlearn to become a cloud engineer but\nlike in your sort of list of phases\ncloud platform is the third one again\ni'm telling you i'm trying to set you up\nfor success and there's some sort of\nprerequisites and skills that throughout\nthe rest of your career in cloud are\ngoing to be very very crucial so that's\nwhy linux and networking and programming\nare before cloud platform now i\npersonally think that the best way to\npick up a cloud platform and learn one\nas a complete beginner is studying for a\ncertification because that guided\nlearning that sort of you know every\ncertification has sort of a curriculum\nthat you need to be able to know before\nyou take it and that guided learning is\ncrucial crucial crucial at the beginning\nonce you're more familiar once you have\none under your belt i think then you can\nstart to like just do more like hands-on\nand more projects and things like that\nand you couldn't get you could get\nanother certification you could get more\nlike a specialized certification or\nwhatever um but i think for those first\nsteps just really studying for\none certification for whichever cloud\nyou want to do\nwill probably be your best like your\nbest bet there's this project called the\ncloud resume challenge and it's\nthe majority of people have completed it\nusing aws\nservices i have my own flavor of that\nchallenge called the azure resume\nchallenge and there will be links to\nthese projects in the description as\nwell\nand that will get you hands-on with a\nbunch of azure cloud services the cloud\nresume challenge will get you hands-on\nwith the lot of aws ones and i think\nthere's even a gcp one out there i'm not\na hundred percent sure but in terms of\nwhich cloud to pick no matter which one\nyou pick go do the cloud resume\nchallenge you're gonna get hands on with\na bunch of things out there you're gonna\nlearn a lot right\nuh in terms of learning a cloud and like\ni guess let's address that which one\nshould i learn\naws gcp or azure pick one of those\nif you still can't decide to pick one\nthat it has like the most amount of jobs\nin your area for the majority of people\nit's probably going to be aws for me\npersonally was azure which is why i\nlearned azure and it worked out because\nnow i work at microsoft right if you\nstill can't pick i would recommend azure\nbecause then you can watch a bunch of my\ncontent i put out azure content every\nsingle week i do a lot of live streams\nwith the microsoft reactor on a bunch of\ndifferent azure technologies um so i\npersonally can you know provide help\nthat's why i would say like oh learn\nazure but i think you can't go wrong\nwith either you know aws gcp or azure a\nlot of people ask me like hey there\nthere are these plot plot these paid\ncloud platforms out there that are like\neducational platforms that you can pay\nlike a monthly fee or yearly fee and\nthey give you like courses but also like\nlabs and stuff like that it's up to you\nif you want to use that i remember when\ni was getting started i had access to\nlinux academy but my employer was paying\nfor it i don't think i would have paid\nfor it on my own because it was pretty\nexpensive and i was like really poor\nback then\nbut maybe it's something that you can\nget your employer to pay for uh also\neach cloud platform is going to have\nlike a free trial and free credits that\nyou get when you sign up so absolutely\nyou know give that a try\nuh and make sure you whenever you sort\nof create something in cloud in the in\nyour cloud environment that you delete\nit once you're done if not you're gonna\nrack up some bills i have videos on my\nchannel on how to set up alerts mistakes\nthat i've made a bunch of other things\nso go take a look at that\nthings that you should be familiar with\nat the end of this phase is just an\nunderstanding of best practices for\ncloud infrastructure reliability\nperformance efficiency and understanding\ni'm not expecting you to like\nfully build on full solutions that\nimplement all these things you know\nidentity how to grant access and provoke\naccess to different users and\napplications uh how to set up billing\nalerts and emails and things like that\nand budgets\nhow to use object storage so in\ni'd be s3 in azure would be blob storage\ni'm not sure what it's called in gcp\num how to deploy virtual machines or\nvirtual machine scale sets you know\nvirtual machines that scale\nhow to work with networking so how to\nset up a v-net how to set up\nsubnets private ip addresses things like\nthat inside of whichever cloud platform\nyou pick\nuh how do you can create a i would say\nserverless uh http api this might sound\nvery confusing but as you get into more\nof the cloud space and if you work with\nthe cloud resume challenge or the azure\nresume challenge you become very\nfamiliar with this but i think uh you\nknow becoming familiar with this concept\nof serverless in terms of cloud\nis going to be very very beneficial\nuh and obviously how to use the cli\nclies are command line interface tools\nthat you can use to\ndeploy stuff or work with your cloud\nenvironment when you're getting started\nyou're going to want to use a lot of\nlike the portal so you go to the website\nand you click around but that takes a\nlot a lot of time and when you're\nactually working in cloud you're\nexpected to be able to manage all these\nthings or do all these things via a\ncommand so becoming familiar with the\nazure cli or the aws cli i'm not 100\nsure what they are called\nso for everything that you can do in the\ngui make sure you're able to you know\nhow to use that command in your terminal\nas well i have a bunch of azure cli\nvideos that i did over the pa or live\nstreams that i did over the past month\nor two\ni have actually have them in english and\nspanish if you speak spanish so go check\nthose out\nuh and yeah i think yeah so get a\ncertification do the resume challenge\nand really just get hands-on and make\nsure you erase everything that you don't\nneed in your cloud environment take\nadvantage of the free accounts the free\ntrials or free credits\nand get hands-on with cloud all right\nnow the last phase would be phase four\ndevops practices oh one thing i forgot\nto mention for the previous phase is\nlearning content or learning resources i\nthink each platform i know microsoft has\nmicrosoft learn and there is just so\nmuch free content out there if you go if\nyou sort of google search the microsoft\nazure certification that you're\ninterested in and find the official\nmicrosoft page and if you scroll down\nyou're going to see it gives you all the\nonline free content that we have\navailable for that that's the content\nthat i would recommend you can go for\npaid courses if you want i don't\npersonally have any ones to recommend i\nknow aws has something similar as well\nand so does gcp\nso there's a bunch of free content out\nthere that you can use phase four devops\npractices now you're going to be\nintroduced to a lot of these as you go\nthrough phase\nlike\none two and three all of them actually\nyou get introduced to infrastructure as\ncode and cicd which is continuous\nintegration and continuous deployment in\nphase three when you're learning a cloud\nplatform and you're doing something like\nthe cloud resume challenge or the azure\nresume challenge or you're doing both\nright you're introduced to version\ncontrol git and github in phase two the\nprogramming and things like that right\nso\na lot of phase four i believe would be\njust you know read up a little bit more\non these things understand more of the\ntheory if you want to get a\ncertification go ahead but yeah focus on\nversion control infrastructure as code\nand ci cd and make sure for every single\nproject that you've implemented\nto have all these things going for those\nprojects as well now if you deploy\nsomething in phase one for example a\ni don't know a free nas\nuh server or a nex cloud server try to\nalso deploy those with something like\nterraform and then you don't really have\nto like deploy it and just keep it going\nyou could also just get rid of it too\nbut yeah getting familiar with\ninfrastructure as code because when\nyou're working in production and actual\nas a professional you're not going to be\nmanually deploying things you'll be\nusing code to describe what you're going\nto be deploying right so just get\nhands-on with that\nand i think that is absolutely it for\nfor these four phases\nnow you might be overwhelmed right now\nthere is a lot to learn and that's just\nthe reality i've tried to put this in\nsort of a learning plath or guideline or\ntimeline things like that that makes the\nmost sense but feel free to you know\nexplore whatever you want at any phase\nanything you want really\nthere are so many new services new cloud\nservices new technologies that come out\nevery single day it's impossible to keep\nup with all of them there are new\nlanguages all the time you can't keep up\nwith all of them just embrace that right\ni have no idea about a lot of things and\nyet i'm working in this space like i\ntold you in how to become a cloud\nengineer in 2020 it isn't necessarily\nabout understanding the new latest and\ngreatest tool it's about understanding\nyour fundamentals and all those skills\nwill translate into whatever you need to\npick up right\nmuch luck to you please feel free to\nreach out to me on twitter instagram\nlinkedin or leave a comment here and i\nwill do my absolute best to address any\nquestion check out learn2cloud.guide\nwe're we're turning it into a full-on\nweb app that's always going to be free\nalways open source\nthat's going to help you sort of\nwith this guide and also have some\nhands-on project ideas so you can make\nsure you follow us on twitter and\nthat'll be launching sometime next year\nor early next year right uh but yeah\nmuch luck to you it is the end of the\nyear\nso i wish you a happy new years and\nlet's get to learning or i don't know\nsomething corny like that\ni'll see you in the next video",
