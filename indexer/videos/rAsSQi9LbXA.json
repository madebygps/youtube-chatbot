yo this is what\nthis is why I was like taking forever\nbecause I just got it I literally got it\ndelivered like\nlike 20 minutes ago I was like oh I want\nto try it on stream\nwhat's going on everybodyso let's take a look at this chat one\nsecond let's make this largeruh\nuh what up Nikos ectar\nSeeker\nI typed this because I may not be able\nto watch GPS thanks for the motivational\ncontent\nyou inspired me into taking a difficult\npath and change in life but what is\nactually easy these daysthank you for sharing your knowledge\nthank you for the kind messages really\nappreciate thatI'm here to help as much as I can so\nit's nice to know that I'm part of\nI'm a small part of your Journeys uh\nKemp is from Cape Town what up what's\ngoing on\nConnor what's going on\nhey everyone\nyeah yeah so I got this this is sick but\nthe reason I'm I'm hold on let me this\nmusic is gonna bother me\nOkay so\nif I do something like hold on let's see\nlike if I have like this code thing like\nI'm no longer massively in the way\nlike it's there right\num hold on I forgot update my WSL the\nonly issue is I don't have a lot of\nspace behind me soI'm gonna have to move it when I have to\nuse the chair because I'm like standing\nright nowum\nbut I'll figure that out\nso for example if I wanted to probably\nmake this biggeruh uh if I wanted to move into like\nI don't knowuh let's move until the\nAPI sure why notI can now not be in the way I'm still\nkind of in the way because it's like\nlarge\nbecause my my self is large\nbut then I just move\nand you all can still see it so I'm\ngonna play around with the format\nuh and see what works best and whatnot\nbut I think this is actually pretty cool\nuh and like we can open this\nno what is this\nuh page no it's not an API\nand uh where here we go\nyeah so it pretty much looks something\nlike this and now I can\nlike zoom in\nCircle stuff zoom out all that this and\nthe things I do to get the best best\ncontent that I can for you all\nuh but yes that's what I've been up to\nlately\nuh Connor says geekin yeah pretty much\nyou can code today since you have the\nscreen uh like on on\non stream see I whenever I do codes\nstreams where I am coding they're not\nreally that popular people really like\nthe Q and A's type of stuff\nso that's why I'm here to just answer\nwhatever questions you guys may have\num\nyeah whenever I I feel like it's because\nI'm not very entertaining when I'm\ncoding because it requires like deep\nfocus and I just can't pay attention to\nthe chat so I feel like it's like not as\nentertaining uh so for for a live stream\nlive stream style type of thing\num\nq a kind of like works the best\nso yeah how's everyone doing\nlet me make this\nprobably a little larger this way I can\ntake a look at this\nbut we hard care we but we hardcore fans\nlove when you codeI should have gotten water before also I\ndon't have too much time today because\num my girlfriend's cooking lunch right\nnow and it's probably gonna be done soon\nit's only hopped on to do a really quick\nstream\num but yeahman\nalso I'm on Windows today I do a video\nwhere I said I switched to Mac which I\ndid\nbut I feel like it's like depending on\nthe day of what I'm feeling\nis what I'll be using I still use the\nMac daily but I still find myself coming\nback to the Windows machine for\ngaming oh my goodness y'all there's this\nnew game called what is it called sons\nof the forest it's in preview still\num early release it is so so good you\nall have to play oh my goodness I just\nhit this someone texted meshe just said you can take 30 minutes\nmore\ndid you hear mebut yeah we can do\nso if we want to do like live stream\ncoding I'm down but I would want to know\nwhat people want to see instead of me\njust working on some random stuff\nbecausethat way it's like more purposeful\na lot of times the stuff that I do for\nwork\num may or may not be of interest\nbut also most of the time I probably\ncan't show you what I'm doing for work\nNDA stuff\num so if we keep it like generic and\ngeneral stuff that people want to see we\ncan do thatI was just so sick why didn't I get a\ngreen screen for poor\nuh let's take a look at hereuh do me a favor hit a like\nhit a like that way we can get more\npeople hanging out with us apparently I\nhave 30 minutes more\nI just got a text she said\nshe said you can take 30 minutes more so\nI have 30 minutes more before we eat\nlunch\num but yeah what's up people usually\npeopleum I have tons of questions by now\nbut maybe just my me rambling here is\nentertainingI'm gonna be in Seattle next month\nthere's a pretty big event going on next\nmonth if people are aware in Seattle for\nMicrosoft I'm going to be in Seattle\nthen that's gonna be fun if anyone's\nbased in Seattle\nlet's grab a coffee would be awesomehave you worked as a sock or a knock no\nnever done any security stuff\nso\nI'm not the biggestresource for that but day\nI'll show you day\nmy guy dayso if we look for day cyber walks this\nis my guy\nthis is my go-to for any security kind\nof stuff\nhe currently works at datadog this kid\nis so impressive\nI only call I mean he's not a kid in my\neyes he's a kid because he's 21 but he's\nso freaking successful and like like one\nof the hardest working people ever but\nhe oh he just released a new video first\nyear I dated dog that's awesome\nbut he has a bunch of stuff on security\nthings\nuh like if we go it's probably more\npopular\ncompti plus my first day as a sock\nanalyst it's probably very relevant to\nthe person who asked this question this\none right here uh but yeah check him out\nday day cyberoxI watch this channel that's awesome\nwhy do you wear a cap in your videos I\nwear a cap all the time not just in my\nvideos\nlike I\nwake up I don't wear it when I when I'm\nlike\nsleeping or like when I work out\nsometimes I do but I primarily just have\ncap\nand I used to have like overhead\nheadphones but I switched to these\nbecause I started wearing these glasses\nthat help reduce like like blue filter\nbut when I was wearing the overhead\nheadphones it pressed too much against\nand it like hurt so I switched to these\nuh but the reason why I like hats the\ncombination of hat and headphones is it\nreally stimulates\nfocus and this could just be a placebo\nbut it works for me so I'm gonna do it\nand it helps me feel like I'm like very\nkind of like\nin\nlike this one dimension that I have to\nfocus on whatever work I have\ncould be Placebo but it is what it is\nwhat's up chilled one huh currently\nfollowing your Zero to Hero vid and\nguess what\nmy workplace has a similar upskilling\nprogram three weeks from Friday nine to\nfive oh wow with a few tweaks rest API\nEtc so thanks that's awesome\nthat is fantastic very happy to hear\nthat you're moving into this uh new\nphase of learning which is awesome very\nhappyI watch this channel cool cooldid you need to know traditional\nnetworking devops Cisco and python\nscripting before doing cloud devopsnoalso python scripting applies to both so\nkeep that in mind as welldid you need to know traditional\nnetworking devops Cisco net nope nope I\nwas just trying to see if there's any\nother part of that question that I could\nprovide my more context to but not\nreally\nI went straight I went sysadmin help\ndesk this admin Cloud engineer\nthat's what I didI interviewed for an Azure Cloud\nengineer job two days ago I have been\nworking for the same org about 10 years\nand I feel it's time to go but also\nfeeling nervous about it is this normal\nto feel I think any time you're trying\nto make a jump to anything\nin any part of your life it doesn't even\nhave to be specific to like your career\nlike I think about like moving to a new\nplace asking someone out on a date or\nmaking a big purchase picking a major in\nschool or things like that\nyou're always going to have a little bit\nof Doubt or you're always going to have\na little bit of feelings where you're\nlike I have no idea what I'm doing\nbut I've learned to lean into that\nfeeling because usually at the other\nside of that feeling is a lot of great\nresults\nso go for it\nyou are like Jeff Fritz with the hat I\nknow Jeff Fritz I I mean technically\nhe's my colleague but so would other\nthousands of people be\nbut I uh thanks for the subscription\num I\nwas actually at one of his talks that he\ndid here in New York a couple months ago\non Maui\nvery cool guy his ability to\nbuild things uh while live for hours is\npretty cool\nbut yeah I I was told um\nI was wearing hats way before\nYouTube pretty much but before joining\nMicrosoft and stuff like that so then I\nI someone told me like have you checked\nout Jeff Fritz's website where he has\nlike his collection of hats I was like\nno yeah he like built it on a stream I\nwas like oh that's pretty awesome\nso it's great that we have a couple of\ncon hat connoisseurs uh and Microsoftis it easier to grasp python once you\nget bash scripting down yes for sure\nbecause in in bash You're Gonna Learn\nwell if you take my bash course you're\ngoing to learn variables You're Gonna\nLearn functions you're going to learn\narrays you're going to learn\nconditionals Loops put them all together\nso yes\none with that foundation and then you do\na couple of things then you take it a\npython you're gonna see that there's a\nlot of overlap obviously python is a\nlanguage\nthat you can take a lot further\nsobig fan thanks for the six months plan\nit helped a lot respect from India shout\nout India\nthank you for following my six month\nplan or\nif you're doing it right now I\nappreciate itit's a dilemma if you are a senior level\nengineer they fire you first because\nthey can hire three to four fresh quick\nlearning 25 year old Engineers but then\nagain you can't progress in career\nwithout going up the ladder\nI think it's a balance that everyone has\nto find personally earlier in my career\nswitching roles a year and a half like\nabout the sweet spot for me was a year\nand a half until now here at Microsoft\nand my current role is the longest I've\never been in any role\nI'm about a year and seven months in\nmaybe a little more\nand I don't have any plans and I've\nmoved I was promoted last year so I want\nto move that rank up instead of jumping\ninto other roles for now\num\nso yeah it's it's it depends on like\nwhat your what your balance is Right\nultimately to make progress in your\ncareer or anything in life you're going\nto have to make some sort of sacrifice\nor a bunch of sacrifices and oftentimes\nyou'll find that you can do that now\nmaybe you can do it later uh for\nwhatever reason later might be a better\ntime now might be a better time so just\nkeep that in mindonce you learn one language you can\nlearn them all in my opinion I would\nagree that's why people need to learn\nlike the logic behind utilizing\nprogramming languages uh instead of just\nmemorizing like syntax\nwhat would you recommend to start on the\npath of being a cloud engineer\nwould you like to make videos about road\nmaps I have I have learned so I'm the\nauthor of learn to Cloud which is pretty\nmuch the most popular open source guide\nto cloud computing learn to cloud.guideuh let's go here I'll show you it here\nlearn to Cloudlearn to cloud.guideso here you go\noh my goodness that is terrible\nhighlighting there let's do it again\nlearn to cloud.guide right this is your\nroadmap to zero the cloud to entry level\ncloud engineer\nand you click on guide\nand then you go through all so we have\nphases\nso phase one starting from zero so if\nyou have no technology\ngo here\nphase one Linux bash networking\nfundamentals phase two's programming\nfundamentals phase three is cloud\nplatform fundamentals phase four devops\nfundamentals phase five is cloud\nsecurity fundamentals and we have\nprojects and additional resources listed\nhere\nnow you may ask how do I know which one\nto start right so kind of read through\nthem\nand get a feel for like okay do you\nalready know this type of content so\nphase zero is pretty straightforward\nlike you do or you don't\nonce you go to like the first\nphase and every base after this at the\nbottom I've added a\nthings you should be familiar with\nand it tells you for the Linux one for\nexample tells you like a couple of\ncommands and for networking a couple of\nconcepts for networking\nand if you feel like you can do all this\nfeel free to go on to the next phase\nuntil whatever phase you feel like\nyou're missing\nyou don't have to feel like you're stuck\nhere or like you absolutely have to go\nthrough zero one two\nit's meant to be as flexible as possible\nwithout you missing out on what I\nbelieve is the foundation to cloud\ncomputing\neach phase includes\nthe context as to why this technology\nmatters for cloud\nI include sort of what I recommend how\nyou break it down like do this topic\nfirst do this one second do this one\nthird and then resources that I\npersonally recommend I've either\nauthored the resources or I've used them\nso I can recommend them\nI try to stick to only free resources\nsome of them may be paid but if they're\npaid they're like 20 30 so it's not like\ncrazy expensive I'm not telling you to\ngo to like\nsix thousand dollar boot camp or\nanything like that\nand then I list projects that I would\nrecommend for you to do it each phase\nand then again\nthe things you should be familiar with\nand then certifications you might want\nto look into again certifications are\nnot you don't have to do them\nbut if you do want to do them I list\nsome that I believe are pretty pretty\nhelpful here and that's for every single\none of those so programming fundamentals\nit all follows that same structure Cloud\nplatform fundamentals follows that same\nstructure devops same thing and Cloud\nsecurity phase was actually written by\nday who I showed the the channel his\nchannel earlier and following again the\nsame thing and this is sort of like\num\nsecurity fundamentals in the context of\ncloud engineering and not necessarily to\nbe a cloud security engineer\nall right now this is sort of\num\nback to the homepage this is sort of\nlike a general guide you take it at your\npace if you want something accelerated I\ngot a lot of people asking hey how would\nI like time this out what if I really\nwant to just dedicate the next I don't\nknow year or the next couple of months\nto really learn this type of stuff well\nthen for that I created so back to learn\na cloud.guide on the study plan if you\nclick on the study plan it's going to\ntake you to something that I call Cloud\ncamp\nand\nwhat it is is I wrote this the idea for\nthis came to me back in December and I\nwas like oh I'd be because I was very\ntired of boot camps I really don't like\nboot camps that's just my opinion so I\nwas like What if I created my own boot\ncamp and I called it Cloud camp and it\nwas just like a self-study kind of thing\nbecause I've learned everything through\nself-study you know sitting down going\non YouTube going through books things\nlike that so here you have your protocol\nkind of just things to keep in mind kind\nof the mindset you need to be in to take\nadvantage of this outline some\ninstructions here and it's a six month\ntype of thing so it tells you start with\nbash gives you really quick overview\nand it gives you like my most\nrecommended resource to learn that and\nsays two weeks and it tells you to break\nit down 10 days doing this four days\ndoing that and some project ideas then\nyou move into networking two weeks again\nthe breakdown project ideas then python\nfive weeks breakdown project ideas\nCloud platform breaks down et cetera et\ncetera et cetera and what was the last\nthing I was gonna say oh and this is six\nmonths and what I do want you to keep in\nmind is that I've factored in for this\nwhole thing\nI factored in three days for each face\nfor documentation purposes so I think\nthis is pretty important at the end of\neach sort of phase that you complete you\nkind of go and you write up a blog post\nyou create a video kind of just summing\nup what you've learned maybe it's a\nproject maybe it's like things that were\nchallenging anything you really want to\nshare I think that's pretty important\nbut that's not where you should be\nspending the majority of your time\nthat's why it's only three days for that\nbut yeah\nso those are the resources I use uh and\nthat I've created and I recommendwhat did I miss\nokay that's what that's at\nif I'm Gonna Learn Cloud for the first\ntime which platform would you recommend\nme gcp AWS or Azure I personally think\nyou can't go wrong with either my\nrecommendation is usually to just take a\nlook at the jobs that you're interested\nin and see what they ask for the most\nAWS Azure gcp you really can't go wrong\nso\nit's up to the job market and if at the\nend of the day you can't pick pick Azure\nand then you can come learn Azure on on\nmy channelI agree your six month plan is dope\nshout out from Cape Town shut up Cape\nTown thank youoh let's see I don't know what I missed\nhererepeat the question because I don't know\nwhere it is\nare you organizing no\nno boot camp it's just the the outline\nthat I've provided which I'm already\ncalling uh I guess technically my boot\ncamp\nbut it's nothing that you have to join\nor anything just kind of follow it and\nyou'll get to where you need to gois it always necessary to blog your\njourney or build in public\nI don't think it's necessary but like\nI've mentioned before I think Landing a\njob\nis 50 your like technical ability your\nresume your cover letter the projects\nthat you've done and 50 who you know\nluck opportunity\nso you really are only in control of\nlike half of you know you're 50 and that\n50 that I allocate to luck to\nopportunity to right place right time I\nfeel like you can improve by networking\nin 2023 the best way to network is to go\non LinkedIn to go on social media to\nShowcase your knowledge to put yourself\nout there in an authentic and not like\nannoying obnoxious way and I think the\nbest way to do this is by sharing your\ntechnical expertise or just something\nthat you've learned whether that be via\nvideo a Blog however you want to do it\nheck even Tick Tock Instagram things\nlike that I that's why I recommend doing\nitis being a cloud architect the ultimate\ngoal that one could achieve in this path\nwhat path do you mean you're talking\nabout learn a cloud\ncyber tooth asks GPS what are your end\ngoals curious about your thought process\nas someone with significant experience\nthat is a fantastic question and\nsomething that I've been trying to\nfigure out for myself lately\nif I'm being 100 honest I don't really\nknow the only thing that I know that I\nwant to do for the rest of my life or\nhowever long I can is teach\nand ideally it would be teaching\nsomething Technical and ideally it would\nbe cloud computing\nI find it very fulfilling and I also\nfind that there's a very big need for\ndifferent types of teachers with\ndifferent types of backgrounds\nespecially educational backgrounds\nbecause I feel like different students\nare impacted by different types of\nteachers and it's not necessarily oh a\nstudent can't learn it's more so maybe\nthere's a different style that works for\nthem so that's the one thing I want to\ndo but I've also realized that I can\nteach no matter what I can teach on the\nside I can teach on YouTube it doesn't\nnecessarily have to be like my full-time\nthing luckily now in Cloud advocacy I\nget to teach a lot which is pretty cool\nbut I\nforesee myself going back into like 100\nengineering Focus type role but maybe\ngoing into Cloud architect Cloud\nengineer at some point but we'll see\nI don't have any end goals I just kind\nof keep doing it for as long as I I it\nfeels appropriate\nand yeah that's pretty much itwhat Azure project would you recommend\nfor people who have no hands-on\nexperience let's take a look\nso if you head over to learn a cloud\nonce again\nand then go to the guide on the left\nside you're going to hit projects\nand then here you have a bunch of\nprojects AWS Azure gcp and devops\nprojects if you're looking for Azure\nthere's Azure Cloud resume challenge\nthere's the serverless resume API\nthere's a bunch of architectures that\nyou can implement the Azure architecture\nCenter\nthere's some Azure networking Labs\nthere's the Azure pet store this one I\nhighly recommend do the Azure resume\nChallenge and then do this one in my\nopinion but there's a bunch of other\noptions here too\nso do check that out learn to\ncloud.guidewould you confirm that Hands-On versus\ncerts 100 but I think certs definitely\nhave a place\nand again my framework is always going\nto be\nassociate level cert project and then if\nyou want to do another certification do\nit after that initial project\nand then do another project that builds\noff the knowledge that you've got from\nthat additional certification\nin my opinion it probably makes more\nsense to do it like an associate level\nlet's say for example do an az104 an\naz204 build a project off of that and\nthen find something like maybe a devops\nrelated certification or a Linux related\ncertification so you're building out a\nwider range and not necessarily a very\nspecific very niche\na specialty because you've got to\nremember you're trying to aim for like\nthese entry-level roles and when you're\nentry level you're just getting started\nthey Prime they care more about you\nbeing able to pick up new things and be\nable being able to work on a more wider\nrange of things than being a 100 expert\nin one areaoh I'm losing track of all these\nquestions\nlet's seewould you be interested in being a cloud\nkeynote speaker for a few minutes at a\nschool remotely from your home I am\ndoing a solar project with a school here\nin Cape Town combining solar plus Cloud\nI'd be interested in hearing more yes\nreach out to me on LinkedIn uh depending\non the date we'd have to take a look at\nthat but that sounds cool we'd love to\nTyrone asks how do you deal with\nlearning multiple Technologies and the\nfeeling of being overwhelmed\nso I have a video actually with the\nframework and kind of the mindset that I\nuse for this for me it's pretty much\nI plan ahead I'm a very big planner I\nlove using calendars and to-do lists and\nI use now I use Microsoft Loop I'm\nmoving over from notion to Loop to have\nmy notes and things like that but it's\nall about giving yourself a time frame\nand sticking to it so for example the\nbeginning of this year January February\nMarch was all about Linux was all about\nbash for myself now moving more into a\nfocus on oh how can I leverage AI apis\nthings like open AI API learning chat\ngbt learning GitHub co-pilot and things\nlike that\nfor about another couple of months and\nthen after that I'll move on the goal\nfor me is to always stick to what I have\nplanned so I plan to learn Linux and\nBash even more then just stick to it\nplenty of things will always come up\nbut for that I pretty much allow myself\nto maintain myself informed so I'll\nlisten to podcasts I'll watch videos but\nI won't pick up like a tutorial that'll\ntake me hours or it will kind of get me\nlearning something new or like Sidetrack\nme\ndon't get me wrong there's definitely\ngoing to be situations where you're\ngonna have to select pick up a new\nlanguage or whatever it is for whatever\nreason but I find that usually people\nget distracted and off their learning\npath because they get an influence from\nlike social media or Tech Twitter or\nLinkedIn or something like that so do\nyourself a favor sit down create a study\nplan stick to it and then later on\nreassess that's what I doafter your two certs two projects you\napply for junior collateral regular\nCloud role or something like assist\nadmin role\nso usually what I recommend and a lot of\npeople don't like to hear this but what\nI recommend is to have a year of some\ntype of support role of experience\nbecause that plus your projects and your\nsearch are going to make you a\nwell-rounded candidate\nbecause after all experience\nis is\nthe goat right\nand Landing an entry-level support role\nis pretty\na lot easier to do than the majority of\nother Tech rules do that for a year\ncouple of that with the Project's\nasserts and you'll be in a great\nposition\nI recommend going for anything that's\ngoing to be a next step for you\nI feel like people tend to get confused\nand think that if it doesn't have cloud\nand the role title then I shouldn't go\nfor it but pay more attention to\ndescriptions for example from making the\nmove for me from help this this admin\nthe job description of the sysadmin gig\nset at the bottom plenty of plenty of\nopportunities to get Hands-On with\nMicrosoft azure so I was like let me go\nfor it but if I was closed off because\nit didn't have cloud in the title I\nwould have missed out on on that\nopportunity so pay more attention to\ndescriptions than titles when you're\ngetting started titles will make more of\nit'll be more of a deciding factor the\nmore you move up but things like\nsysadmin things like Junior Cloud\nengineer support engineer or Cloud\nsupport engineer Cloud analyst Cloud\nadmin a lot of help desk rules now have\nuh like tasks with Azure active\ndirectory and things like that and those\nare Cloud Technologies right so anything\nthat gives you some kind of exposure to\ncloud in my opinion is a good stepoh my goodnessEvan says Hey GPS I've been in it for\nyears looking to transition to a cloud\nrole got the AWS Cloud certified\npractitioner cert work in our\narchitecture then projects any\nsuggestions to add so you've been in it\nfor years that's awesome so I would say\nif you got okay and you're doing two\nmore one more certification okay perfect\nso finish up that sir\nget two projects that you can explain in\nand out and then most I mean you just\ntold me you have experience in it so I'm\ngoing to say that's probably going to be\nuh relevant so tailor your resume tailor\nyour cover letter and become very\ncomfortable with speaking about your\nprojects like you should be able to\nanswer any question people ask you about\nyour projects why did you select this\nservice why did you select that service\nmake sure that I'm GitHub make sure\nthey're documented nicely\nand\npractice your your interviewing skills\nin terms of like the soft skill\nquestions that you'll get so they'll ask\nyou things like when was the last time\nyou faced uh a colleague who gave you\nnegative feedback how did you handle\nthat you don't want to have to come up\nwith those answers in the interview\nitself you should be able to practice\nthese and these are very generic not\nspecific to just Tech or Cloud so you\ncan go and Google them or Bing them or\nask chat GPT and go practice them become\ncomfortable about talking about your\nskill set but I feel like you're in a\ngood position because you already have\nexperience in it so learn how to\nleverage that learn how to speak to that\nthe best way possible\nand I think you're probably in a good\nposition\nwhat up zidi\nthank you this is my favorite Cat by the\nway\nit's uh tux\npeace out campus have a good oneCody asks I've been a junior susadment\nfor about a year now awesome\nis a normal path to go for a cloud-based\nrole next if you want to get into Cloud\nyes\nI I think that's a very natural\nprogression there you could also make a\njump into maybe like networking engineer\nor maybe something more\nlike Security based if you wanted to\nbut I think the cloud is filled with\nopportunities and will expose you to a\nlot of other types of Technologies and\nareas so something like Cloud support\nCloud engineer and then from there you\ncan move into another Niche like Cloud\nsecurity which is very lucrative or\n[Music]\nCloud architect things like that\nall right I gotta go y'all because I\nneed toum\neat\nbut I'll see you all I don't know I'll\nstream next week or something like that\npeace out everyone",
