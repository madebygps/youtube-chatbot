hardso that's good to know\nuh how's everyone doingquite an interesting day todayuh happy hump day\nall thosewords of encouragement uh cliche as it\nsounds probably hate a little\na little warmer todayuh zxy hello hello hello Cisco how you\ndoing SP plays what's going on\nuh sterling silver\nhow you doing\nJohn how you doing\nuh how you doing Sam\nuh I hope all is great with you today\nyeah yeah it's been\nI mean I try to be\ngrateful every day right because there's\nmany things to be grateful for but uhit's a tough tough day today especially\ngiven the news with my employer\nthe stream we're all waiting for let me\nKayla ask for Microsoft are we all\ndoomedI assume you saw satya's email as well\nas based on the title yeah yeah yeah\nyeah yeah I mean it's not just the email\nI saw\nlike there were a lot of um\npeople sharing\nthat they've been laid off on Twitter on\nLinkedIn stuff like that that I just uh\nchecked out before hopping on this live\nI tried to\nstay off\nfor the majority of the day\nyeah I was trying to like I mean I\nblocked Twitter and Linkedin\nduring the work day anyway\nuh so I just it was kind of hard to do\nit today but I tried to do as much as I\ncan and got through as much work as I\ncould without getting into it because I\nknew once I started to look\nat people's updates it was going to be\njust chaosin terms of like my own feelings it's\ntough you know I know I'm often saying\nlike business you know business is going\nto make business moves and I kind of say\nthat for myself to kind of have my own\nback and and then just you know be smart\nwith finances but at the end of the day\nthese people are\nyou know they have a whole livesno matter how financially prepared or\nyou are like a layoff is a layoff so\nit's difficult the\nto feel any kind of like\nexcitement or happiness for ituh hey how you doing\nI like the name Cisco I want to have a\ncat my name is Cisco well like another\ncat because I already have one she's\nshe's like down there playing she'll\nsometimes hop on here so maybe she will\nuh\nI was not\nlaid off today that doesn't mean that\nI'm not laid off in general it just\ndoesn't this just means I haven't heard\nabout anythingum\nI\nit's the end of my work day\nbecause it's five o'clock here in New\nYork I'm on East Coast time\nand I haven't heard anything so I guess\nthat means for today I'm safe but it\nsucks I mean I think that feeling of not\nknowingis\nyeah it's it's like not really niceuhlayoffs happen gotta be prepared see I\nunderstand this and this is why I'm like\nvery financially responsible this is why\nI save\nlike crazy almost to the extent of like\nlimiting happiness in the present day\nbutyou can't really understand how it feels\nunless it happens to you which is why I\ndon't fully understand either because it\nhasn't happened to me and I've never\nbeen laid offso just I don't know I just feel like\nthe tough luck tough love kind of\nconceptit's just never gonna be the best\napproach sotwo cats Cisco and Juniper yeah\nthat's a good idea but the thing is I\nalready have one cat her name is Zoe so\nthat means I'd have to get two more cats\nand have three cats in total and that's\nway too many catsjust finished my finished my day up and\nwatching LinkedIn just exploding with\nnotifications of layoffs remote I\nhaven't even been\nup to date with what's going on in AWS\nobviously very aware of what's going on\nMicrosoft\num\nbut yeah shout out to all my Microsoft\ncolleagues and friends at AWS\ntough it's tough\nuh but also hello Eric oh and also hello\nJeff thanks for tuning in\nyou know positions they are laying off\nfor I don't knowdon't know but GPS your Cloud Guru don't\ndo this to us do what to us we'll talk\naboutit's hard to say motivated especially\nwhen all these days are happening and\nyou are new in Tech\nI did uh I did an interview\nwith Katie uh Kathie Lee\nit's on my channel\num just honestly just she's just one of\nthe people that\nI've learned so much from\nin just brief amount of conversations\nthat I've had just because of the years\nof experience that she has in the field\nand she's been through three or four\ndifferent periods of layoffs\nuh and then she was mentioning how you\nknow if she were to get laid off now she\nhas 23 years of experience and like five\nor six different software developer\nroles like she ultimately would be fine\nbut\nit's the newbies it's new people in Tech\nwho don't have a network to Leverage\nwho you know hadn't really gone through\nsomething like this so it could\npotentially impact them you know maybe\nsome people are coming out of college\nand have that debt on their back like\nthat's tough tough to think aboutyeah\nI think they said they were letting\npeople go until Q3 and only some got the\nnotification today I believe oh my\ngoodness also I don't know any of this\nstuff to be\nlike facts or anything like that\num\nI'm not here to\nshare any rumors or any emails or\nanything like that all I know is that I\nwas laid off today and I know some\npeople were\nnot being called as I promise companies\nalways look out for themselves yeah\nbusiness is business people look out for\nthemselves you gotta look out for\nyourself but that doesn't just because\nthat is the fact doesn't make the\nreality any less\ndifficult righthow do you prepare for a layoff you mean\nemotionallythis might be in response to someone\nelse who said you got to prepare\nI mean and that's the thing and I like\nthat you brought this up it's like you\ncan prepare as much as you want\nfinancially but emotionally a lot of\npeople do enjoy their work do want to\ncontinue doing their work uh look\nforward to doing that kind of stuff so\nhaving it be a decision made for you\nthat oh you're just gonna stop doing\nthis like that can take an emotional\ntoll I don't care if you have passion\nfor the role or don't have passion for\nthe role like to an extent this is going\nto affect you in other ways that are not\njust Financial ways\nand oftentimes it's these other ways\nthey're not Financial where we are less\nprepared here's my cat\nwhere we are less prepared to\nor we have less tools to prepare for\nbecause what does it even mean to be\nemotionally prepared for a layoff all\nright\nI might have to meet this one secondshe loves rubbing up on this mic drone\nokay you can stay here but you can't rub\non the microphone because it makes a\nweird noise for everyone who's listening\nokay\nshe's uh so she's an adult cat she's\nabout five years old now she has major\nband admittent issues so she always\nlikes to be\nin the presence of someone doesn't\nalways have to be necessarily like right\nup\nshe's also purring very loud right now\nbut she's she's five and uh prior to me\nadopting her she's been at a couple of\ndifferent homes which is where she\ndeveloped the abandonment issues because\nshe's constantly thinking like oh I'm\ngonna be left like where's a new place\nthat I have to get used to but she's\nbeen with me for a couple of months\nshe's great lovely cat very loving but I\nhave this issue when I want to work or\ndo something is that she'll want to hop\non and be very close so\ntending to\ntrying to give her attention and make\nher feel safe is is uh important\nlet's see here now she also cut me off\nemerging fund three six months if\npossible yeah well that should be a\ndefault\nlike you should have three to six months\nin savings no matter what for any kind\nof reason rightit's happened to me before I'm not\nsaying this always happens but it turned\nout for the best out to me grew as a\nresult from moving on absolutely I mean\nyou're not gonna stay in in in like your\nhome and be like all right well I got\nlaid off and I'm not gonna do anything\nabsolutely not but\nyeah\nI don't think any of it makes it easier\nI believe the majority of the layoffs\ncame from HR Headhunters with some\nspecific engineering divisions\ninteresting\nso are these layoffs for cloud parts of\nMicrosoft 2 I thought Cloud was very\nmuch needed cloud is needed but when it\nwhen it comes to the economy like no one\nis safe\nwhen it comes to a layoff I don't really\nthink anyone is safe there's no such\nthing as a layoff proof for session\nproof role\nuh HB has been following you for the\npast three months and I'm starting the\ncloud journey and I'm starting your six\nmonth six month plan I have to ask you\nif it is enough to get an internship\nafter that\nso I think it's enough of a skill set to\nland an internship but a lot of Landing\nroles is a lot more than just\ntechnically being able to deal with the\nrole requires you to do remember land\nincome kind of rolls is a lot about your\nresume it's a lot about your people\nskills it's a lot about being able to\ncommunicate your skill set so make sure\nyou develop that as well I would also\nsay it's very useful to have some sort\nof online presence some sort of online\nportfolio as well\nbuilding your network both virtually and\nin person is very important attend\nmeetups attend job fairs attend as many\nevents in persons as you can get your\nname out there have that tailored resume\nhave that tailored cover letter if you\nare in school that's a great way to\nbuild connections to build a network uh\nmaybe there's professors maybe there's\neven internships at your school like\nmaybe there's like a support role or\nhelp this role that you can leverage\nanything that gives you some sort of\nworking experience is going to be\nhelpful to keep all that in mindsucks GPS I remember previous videos you\nwere prepping for this possibility I did\nnot think it would happen at Microsoft\nthose seems no tech company is safe no I\nmean I always have the mentality that\nI'm gonna get fired\num even if the economy is fantastic so\nas morbid as that sounds it does help me\nprepare\num\nbut I always thought like there's no\nreal company that's safe to this kind of\nstuff\nour small team went through Severance\noffers at the end of 2020 which ended\nwith the rest of our team leaving and\nare eventually getting laid off and you\nknow what we're all better at paying\nremote we're all at better paying remote\njobs that's awesome happy to hear the\n[Music]\num\nthe positive outcome\nand uh\nyeah I guess ultimately you know it's\ngonna be okay for sure but it's still\nlike\nI like to\nI guess now because I have a sense of\ncommunity and somewhat of an audience\neven though I don't like that word\nI think it's just important for us to\ncome together and be like oh we're not\nalone kind of thing because feeling kind\nof alone in situations like this will\nmake everything 100 worse like most\nmost negative situations right\nalso thank you for asking us constantly\nyour videos to be financially\nresponsible I feel like I I might freak\npeople out that I talk about it so much\nbut\nuh I never knew anything about money\nuntil like I knew so I only knew that\nyou were supposed to make money and save\nmoney because that was sort of like the\nthe the financial knowledge that my\nparents have and there's something wrong\nwith that it's more so that that's what\nthey had so that's what they passed\nalong\nit's not till I met a friend of mine I\nwas working at an Apple Store\nwho she taught me about credit she\ntaught me about investing and kind of\ngave me hints and then I took that and I\nwent and bought books and I saw videos\non YouTube and things like that and\nthat's why I know a lot more now\num but that was ultimately one thing\nthat really really held to me I remember\nwhen I left my cloud engineering job\nthere was a few months between Landing\nmy next job after that and I could have\nnever made that jump if I had didn't\nhave like my safety net money but I\nwould have not known how to do that in\nlike a responsible way uh in like a real\nrealistic way if it weren't for the\neducation that I you know\nread and watched and it and if it\nweren't for that friend and a lot of\ntimes that friend doesn't exist for a\nlot of people so you end up kind of\nhaving this\nI guess\num like non-existent Financial knowledge\nthroughout your life until maybe the\ninjury maybe you never do\nso I try to be that virtual friend for\nall of youabsolutely this is a speaking point that\nmade me rush to subscribe to GPS content\noh thank you did you get burnt out\nduring studies or work and how did you\ndo uh\nnot really I don't think I've ever\nexperienced burnout\num\nI I'm a very organized and scheduled\nscheduled first type person so\nlike for example today I was like I'm\ngonna end work by five it doesn't matter\nhow much I'm like get done or don't get\ndone I'm ending work at five\nwhich is a little earlier than it\nusually\nand work I usually kind of work until\nlike seven o'clock\num but I knew today I was gonna need\nsome extra time later in the day mainly\nbecause yesterday I worked until like\nnine o'clock nine pm\num but also just given the context of\nwhere\nand what's going on everywhere\nbut I don't really yeah get burned out\nmainly because I schedule time\nto do uh\nto do other things I also have people in\nmy life that really hold me accountable\nto not working as much into paying\nattention to other aspects of my life I\nhave this cat now like if I don't play\nwith this cat or feed this cat by the\nlike 7 ish 7 30ish she will meow\nnon-stop so it'll force me to stop\nworking it's great get yourself a cat\nRafael what up though what's up how you\ndoing everyone do me a favor hit a like\non the stream let's try to hit I I\nalways try to hit a number on these\nlet's let's go for we're at 48. let's\ntry to hit 100. I've never hit 100\npeople watching this live streams oh\nshe's coming back uh so it'd be cool to\nhit it today so do me a favor and hit\nlike on that let's move this mic back\nthis way cats always know cats always no\nbecause it's going to lay on the\nkeyboard 100 so she did ruin my keyboard\nshe did ruin my keyboard I now have some\nsticky keys because she knocked over\ncoffee on my q and for those who don't\nknow and maybe you do know this is my\nfavorite keyboard This is a Microsoft I\nthink compact design keyboard yeah it\ndoesn't have any backlight it's not\nrechargeable it looks it uses like one\nof those watch batteries right\num\nbut I love this thing I can't remember\nhow much I could I bought for it but\nit's quiet it's so low profile uh you\ncan use it with multiple devices it's\neasy to put in the backpack so when I go\ninto the office I just throw it in there\nit's durable I've dropped it but of\ncourse my cat had to ruin it I guess the\ncoffee ruined it\num\nso there's that but now I have to get\nanother keyboard I'm torn because the\nlocal Best Buy doesn't have one of these\nand they won't have them in stock for\nyou have to like order them Amazon says\nthey're not an orange stock either\num and I was just talking about this the\nother day I was like I need to order\nlike two or three more of these just in\ncase they discontinue them and then here\nwe are now\nI'm not opposed to trying other\nkeyboards if anyone has any suggestions\nI would\nlike to know uh I don't like make I I\ncan do mechanical keyboards if they're\nquiet\num\nbut I just don't like the clickety-clack\nit's just too much especially with like\nvideo recording and streaming it just\nit's too too disruptive on the\non like the background is hold on\nI think my partner just arrived I can\nhear her at the door and that's why the\ncat ranshe thinks I'm gonna be laid off LOL who\nthinks you're gonna be laid off\ndid I miss a messageI'm actually third semester student Cs\nand have done PF\nP fun program fundamentals uh\nobject-oriented programming data\nstructure algorithms and database\nManagement Systems that's like a good\ngood set there you should be able to\nfind internships with school rightuh let me see here\ndo you reckon remote jobs will be rare\nnow\nah this is tough\ngiven how many tech companies want\npeople to come back in uh to in person\nor like a hybrid thing I don't think\nthey'll be rare I mean I think I think\nthere's definitely more than there was\nbefore the pandemic but I like to\nI I whenever people ask me like is cloud\nlike a remote friendly role I think\nremote is not something that's\nassociated with a role specifically or\nfield specifically that is more so based\non your team based on your organization\nbased on your company like they will\nDefine remote so that the the the\nrelationship with remote work and your\nability to do remote work maybe it's\nlike a seniority thing like it really\ndepends on like the rules that your\ncompany has in placecan Cloud jobs be done remotely sure\nRo Cloud jobs remote no\nthis is something I don't have a\ntailored cover letter would you be able\nto give some examples yeah I have a\nvideo on my channel it goes in it's\ncalled something resume\nI have to look it up\nwow my cat is meowing a lot is she\nhungry\nforeignI have my uh Microsoft cover letter\nexample\non my YouTube there's a YouTube video it\nsays cover letter tips and tricks or\nresume tips and tricks something like\nthat that is I'm actually using my\nresume and my coverlet as an example be\nsure to take a look at that my role with\ncover letters is\nI know a lot of people think that\nthey're not worth doing because they're\noften skipped but if it's a role that\nyou really really want you can\npotentially make a difference with a\nsolid cover letter so do it that's why\nfor my Microsoft one I definitely did it\nI took my timeum made it short and sweet and it worked\nmy boss read it he told me later that he\ndid read it so\nthere's that\nuh\nhonestly I'm amazed that high schools\ndon't have mandatory Financial class\nyeah that's like fine like Finance taxes\ninvesting all that kind of stuff like\ngiven the importance of the stock market\nin the US like why isn't finance a thing\nin high school\nall right\nI used to think you save most of your\nmoney but the truth is you're gonna\ninvest in the next one long term yep\nI don't want to become a finance\nlike Channel I don't want to give all I\nwould say people is go it's really\nreally easy to kind of find like a like\na general frame Finance framework for\nyou to go and implement\nlike okay what do I do with my money\nwhere do I place my money I like to\nthink of it like a pipeline like each I\nget two paychecks a month I know where\nevery quantity of that paycheck goes\ninto what\nwhat that looks like for you will be\ndifferent than me of course\num\nbut like look it up yeahI'm less Amazed by that because a lot of\nfolks want us to graduate as suckers oh\nI feel like that's a good conversation\nuhburnout is normal when you try reading\nthe book deep worker watching YouTube\nvid on yeah do you work by Cal Looper is\nfantastic I recently watched a video\nwhere he covered this thing of called\nthe I think it's like it's like it's a\nconcept of Cycles where you're working\nreally hard for six weeks you take two\nweeks off six weeks two weeks off or you\nknow replace six weeks with whatever you\nfeel is appropriate maybe it's six\nmonths two months off something like\nthat\num I think it's an interesting concept I\nknow that it's difficult if you aren't\nsort of your own boss or in charge of\nyour own schedule so whatever that looks\nlike for you go and give it a try also\nit's on his YouTube channel Cal now it's\nwell it's his podcast it's also a\nYouTube channel\num\nbut I like the idea of like going hard\nfor a amount of time taking some kind of\nbreak going hard time to break hard\nsomething like that so keep that in mind\nI really do think it's all about\nhaving activities or having priorities\noutside of work that you are constantly\nlike doing something towards so whether\nthat be\num like your partner your family your\nvideo games like before I was dating\nsomeone I used to play a lot of video\ngames\nand I really love open world video games\nbecause it like really takes you out of\nlike your current reality and like go\nyou go in like a different you know\nyou're a character in a whole different\nworld I think it's cool\nthat would take me away from work and it\nwould be awesome just an hour of like\ndoing nothing but being in this whole\ncompletely different world\nbut find something maybe you read maybe\nyou play guitar I don't know I also\nthink something that has some sort of\nprogression is pretty cool because then\nthen you know the momentum is awesome it\nmakes you keep wanting to come back and\nback\num couldn't agree more that's why\nthey're intentionally failing at keeping\nfinancial literacy out okay fair\nbut what I will also say is it's pretty\neasy to find Financial\ninformation nowadays\nbut yes it should still be taught in\nhigh schoolhow much did how much should I spend to\nget the expert level in Cloud what does\nthat mean\ndon't understand what that question got\na head outside over in English to be\nsending you all love hope it works out\nfor all you\nthanks Scott thanks for hanging out have\na good one\num\ncat just wants to learn cloud is okay\nyeah\nshe's always around uh cloud is very\nwide yeah\nlet's see\nmight be a dumb question but I know\nPython and cball plus the extent of oop\nand I follow your six month plan to\nbuild that skill set and then don't want\nto go into cloud with those skills be\ntransferable\nyeah of course because you're learning\num\nif you already have programming\nknowledge then you're going to learn\nbash you're going to learn networking\nfundamentals you're going to learn Cloud\nfundamentals which is important for I\nthink any engineering aspect just under\nhaving like a solid understanding of\ncloud is always going to be a benefit if\nit's not your main focus and then devops\nfundamentals\nuh maybe some of the devops stuff like\ncontainers won't be too relevant for\nother roles outside of like SRE cloud\nand devops but having an understanding\nof everything I think is important\nbecause ultimately the cloud is just\nwhere something\ndeployed to rightuh yes correct I don't like mechanical\nkeyboards either yeahremote jobs are definitely getting\nharder to find but still more available\nthan pre-covered yeah definitely\num\npre-covered them oh no I worked for a\ncloud Guru that was fully remote before\nthat in the cloud engineered gig I\nworked at a SMB\nand that was hybrid\nat the most working two times two days a\nweek at homeI feel like I lost\nyes do you use a Windows or Mac laptop\nso I have a Windows desktop this is a\ncustom PC like the one that I kind of is\nmy primary machine I have a MacBook Pro\nM1\nand then I have my work laptop that is a\nThinkPad p14s\nI don't use the MacBook as much it's\nmainly for whenever I'm like at my\nparents house or whenever I'm not home I\nneed to get work done\nuh I will have that laptop on me for\nthatby the time I finish work I'm too tired\nto apply for jobs any advice\nnot really like if you want to get a job\nyou got to apply like what what kind of\nwhat else kind of advice can I can I\ngive to you[Music]\num\nreplaying some Witcher 3 now with Ray\ntracing good times I'm replaying uh days\ngone I loved I played days gone on PS4\nuh I loved that game when it came out I\nthink it was like 2018 and I was so sad\nthat it didn't get\nlike people were giving it bad reviews\nfor some reason and I could not\nunderstand because\nit is just such a lovely game and then I\njust recently got it for PC I got it for\ntwo dollars no no hold on\nI got it for twenty dollars because I\nbought I bought uh days gone and I\nbought Sleeping Dogs on Steam for 22.\nthey were both on sale\nand I just been playing that game again\nI such a good game just riding the\nmotorcycle\nthrough the world\nlove itsee now people are asking Finance\nquestions that I don't want to be giving\nmy opinions on MIT finest course is\namazing and free on YouTube there we go\nthat's a good resource go and check that\nout\nummy heart really goes out to those here\nat work visas no way they could have\nseen layups coming like this yeah like\ntheir status depends on that\nstuff\ntoughyeah\nit's 3 30 here in Pakistan thank you so\nmuch for time to go and hope you retain\nyour job\num with Microsoft losses thank you\nappreciate the support there\nbeen playing days gone at PC and loving\nit so far I wish there was open\num\nnot a co-op\nbecause there's Co-op for I play Dying\nLight with my brother Dying Light to\nco-op with my brother loved it it made\nthe experience so much\nI enjoyed the the game experience so\nmuch more in Co-op\nobviously it's like a bonding kind of\nthing with my my sibling uh because we\nboth really like video games but I wish\nthere was more co-op games like that\nwe'll see what 2023 has in store\nDying Light one and two were fun yeah\ngreat gamesI forgot I have these going probably the\nsame sale oh I need to go play that it's\na great game where did you get that hat\nuh let me find it it's by Mark doiker\nuh\nhe has like this store where he makes\nuh he makes let's see\nbye okay here we goI got it here let me paste it in the\nchatthis this is where I got the Hat they\nhave a bunch of t-shirts too\nI had hope for the day before but it's\nnot looking good the day before is that\ngame that everyone says doesn't really\nexist rightand like they had hype around some sort\nof trailer that they were gonna release\nor some sort of Nvidia thing that was\ngonna release\num like at the beginning of the month\nbut it just ended up being like a vlog\nor behind the scenes kind of thing\nyeah see those kind of those kind of\nthings are like sketchy to me because\nit's like\nwhen there's like so much hype up front\nit worries me because I think cyberpunk\ndid it to everyone where everyone just\nworries about like oh if it's if there's\na lot of hype and it looks promising\nthen it's gonna let us down kind of\nthingso\nalso whenever I get a notification from\nOutlook I'm just like\na freaking\nanxious mess or teams like today I've\njust been like oh my goodness what it's\nmy turn this morning I got a meeting\ninvite\numfrom a sync uh from someone and I was\nlike oh no this is the end but they were\njust moving the time of a sink that we\nhad in their first place\nso yeah I don't know it's like on edge\nkind of thing it's kind of crazy I try\nto pride myself in being\nsomewhat stoic with these types of\nthings but even then it's toughuh\nday before was way too ambitious what\nthe small team it has so no surprise\nhonestly\nit looks so cool though it looks like\neverything I want in a video game but\nhmm\nHBS glad you're speaking on this when a\nwhen I heard the news I thought of you\nthis environment reminds me of the first\nweb crash but this industry is so much\nmore mature\nsee I was talking to my again the the I\nreleased the interview with Kathy Lee a\nsenior Cloud solution architect at\nMicrosoft and she was\nshe worked during the dot.com boom went\nthrough the.com crash one through 2008\nrecession layoffs in like the mid 2010s\nnow\nand she told me it seems it feels a lot\nsimilar\num and I think the biggest piece of\nadvice she's like just keep in mind like\nwe don't know when this is gonna endoh goodness uhso yeah that's where that's ateveryone's doing a favor hit a like we\nwere trying to hit 100 live viewers\nif we can hit that 100 I'd be so happy\nthat'd make my day that would help me\nrecover from\nuh\na day filled with layoff newsGod of w God of War I'm assuming I've\nheard good things but I feel like I\ncan't I don't really like\nI don't know my type of video games like\nopen world type games is very like\ndistinct like I like Sleeping Dogs I\nlike GTA I like\num days gone the far some of the fry\ncries far crys three four five amazing\nFar Cry 6 not too not a big fan\numyeah those type of open World Games\nDying Light but then things like like\nGod of War I I don't know maybe it's\nlike the type of story I'm not a big fan\nof\num but then again I liked Zelda which I\nfeel is like sort of like\nit's not similar but it's uh\nwhat's like what's the type of like\nstory\nnot medieval\nsort of I don't know has like so many\ndifferent influences\nI'm very hit or miss with the types of\ngames I like not sure why I think the\nstory I like the story to be like this\nis almost possible for to happen to you\nbut not really\nbut like something like a zombie a cup\napocalypse could be very possible so\nmaybe that's whyhey GPS learning some python for the\nnext few weeks months wish me luck\nawesome\nit's never a bad idea never a bad idea\nto Learn Python\noh Red Dead Redemption that's another\ngood game tooI only got a war but I will never get\nover the fact that it somehow beat Red\nDead 2 in 2008. what a good game oh my\ngoodness Red Dead Redemption I just\nwatched this video on YouTube about this\num\nI watched the weirdest video game be uh\nvideo game videos on YouTube like I once\nwatched this video about how long you\ncan carry a bowl of soup in Reddit\nRedemption without dropping it\nwas fascinating\num but then I also watched this video\ntoday about how there's this group or\nthis clan in Red Dead Redemption called\nthe Reapers or something like that and\nthey're like just a bunch of people who\nare very disciplined in the online game\nand they have rules and it's really\nstrict to get into\nfascinating so fascinatingI remember your early videos it's crazy\nto see the progression thank you\nappreciate that I've been trying to\noftentimes I do want to quit YouTube I'm\nnot gonna lie like the past two months\nI've just been like why am I doing this\num but I'm still here\nso trying to make some progress Fallout\nNew Vegasuh Watch Dogs yes I played Watchdogs too\nI loved it the Watchdogs the one where\nthey did the switching characters I felt\nlike the switching characters brought no\nlike no benefit to the game but the game\nwas still cool it was gorgeous as well I\nvery much like the futuristic Vibe very\ncool\nWatch Dogs 2 was the best in my opinion\num\nbut yeah we'll see I don't know are they\ncontinuing that game are they doing more\nI don't remember 100hearing lots of good reviews for\nStarfield another game that I'm\ninterested in\nyes yes\nuhplus there's efficiency wave it needs to\nshake out AI engine being sued by Getty\nImages I saw that I think I saw it today\nwhat I think it was the uh was it that\nlensa app that was getting sued I can't\nremember 100 who it was\nLast of Us yes I played the I played\nsome of it I know they had like a\nremastered version\nof was it the first one the second one I\ncan't remember\nI didn't finish the whole thing because\nI got creeped out by the what are they\ncalled the clickers the those the\nzombies in there I can't remember what\nthey're called got way too creeped out\nbut then now that I've played Dying\nLight and days gone I feel like I can\ncome back and I'll be fine\nof the jump scares to me\nthe jump scares to me sometimes get me\nespecially now that I played PC and it's\nlike the screen is right here and then\nlike I use like high quality headphones\nlike I could feel like I'm in the game\nso it might be a little intense\nsometimes Far Cry 345 is excellent like\nsix two\nFar Cry 345\nfor me is my favorite it doesn't get a\nlot of love but five has just a great\nstory\num\nlike six two but I can see where some\nstuff got silly like it's Guardians of\nthe Galaxy or something also good\nHorizon games\noh a dinosaur and a heart\nthank you\nHorizon games that's the one where you\nhave like you're in the past but also in\nthe future like the um\nthe the you have like robotic dinosaurs\nright or robotic animals but you have\nlike uha caveman type attire that's that's that\none right I'm probably butchering this\ndescription but my brother\nmy brother really likes the game the\nsoup Journey you need to watch this\nvideo go go on YouTube and search how\nlong can you carry a bowl of soup in Red\nDead Redemption and you'll find the\nvideo that I'm talking about this is the\nstuff that I watch when I can't sleep at\nlike three in the morning\nand uh and then I just send them to my\nbrother watch let me see what's the last\none is because I'm sure I saw something\nand I was like I need to send this to my\nbrother\noh look like look this is the last one I\nsent my brother is\ncounting every single tree in red Dem\nRedemption 2.uh also let me see here\noh I sent him the trailer for the day\nbefore\noh no he sent it to me originally he's\nlike check this out\nlet me see here I'm pretty sure I have\nlike more videos of that I've sent him\nlike yeah this is a random stuff I watch\nat three in the morning uh we talked\nabout the cup\noh is there a way to see all your links\nin\nyes here we gotheoh these are like a lot of music videosokay I can't see anything now but go\ncheck that outWatch Dogs Legion ended support only a\nyear after being out due to poor knit\nplayer number oh I didn't Legion that's\nwhat it was called I didn't know that\nthat sucksthat was I mean it was an interesting\ngame but it was just doing too much for\nno reason\nBaldur's Gate three or two my favorite\ngame I have to check out Starfield\nis that out already I think I saw some\nsort ofumlike I just Googled sarfield and says\nMicrosoft layoffs include gaming units\nbehind Halo Starfield\nohyou guys not out yet\nfirst new universe in 25 years Bethesda\nCole yeah I think I saw like a teaser\ntrailer or something like thatplease don't quit I've been watching\nvideos for a while very inspired thank\nyou appreciate that\nsuper skeptical surfing especially after\nthe last Fallout what I uh I don't I I\nnever played any Fallout games so no\ncontext there but I know there was a lot\nof like\nhate around umthe lot like I think was the last one or\nthe last two something like that\nLast of Us show is coming out on HBO\nit's insane looking I'll have to take a\nlook I don't watch a lot of TVI'll watch the office I'll watch YouTube\nand then the rest is just like video\ngames or doing some kind of other thing\nI kind of miss playing videos of control\nor but I just can't go back after using\nkeyboard for so long I use um\nXbox controller\nI know everyone says that if you play in\na PC you should play with keyboard but\num prior to playing PC I've always\nplayed PlayStation so using a controller\nis like\nthis I don't know it's just more\ncomfortable I don't really care about\nbeing super accurate or anything like\nthat plus um I play like FIFA and 2K a\nlot uh so for matches like\nyou can't be a controller for that\nso yellen's\nCloud Atlas meets Jurassic Park yeah\nwhat\nHBS being kidino Santa Maria just want\nto say thank you for uploading your Kyle\nvideos I'm learning a lot watching from\nNew Zealand hey thank you very much\nappreciate that I can't wait I can't\nwait to take your bash course and I love\nyour blog post but I lost the link to\nthe bash course can you please listen\nbash course is not out yet we're about\n50 done uh all recording and stuff is\ngonna be wrapped up by the end of this\nweek then it goes on to the editor\num and a couple of other kind of details\nwe have to get going and then it'll be\nreleased I'm aiming for that to be\nreleased\nfirst or second week of February but it\nmight get pushed for marketing stuff but\nas always I'll keep everyone up to date\nwith what's going on there right now\nit's looking like it's about 20 to 25\nvideos from five to ten minutes long\nwe're covering a lot of stuff we're\ncovering I mean just the stuff that I\nrecorded today we're doing\nuh sorry like what is a script variables\nconditional statements case statements\nLoops uh while until uh functions\nputting all together uh in a script\nwe're covering what is a terminal uh how\nto set up the the the environment\nrecovering uh changing permissions\nrecovering redirection pipelines uh oh I\ncan't really think the rest of it um\nthere's a couple of other videos that\nwe're covering but there's a lot it's\neverything you need to get started with\nbash and I think it's probably enough\nfor like a junior Cloud admin skill set\num so it's going to be a great great\nresource for that first step of uh\nreally becoming comfortable with a cloud\nenvironment so once it's out I will make\nsure to keep everyone updated but we're\nabout halfway there nowjust wanted to put out there that the\nnewest edition of the Python crash\ncourse was polished a week ago oh nice\nnice nice nice nice nice niceum\nthat is a fan that's a book right I can\nremember that one alongside the python\nwhat's it called python for no it's not\npython for beginners that's the\nMicrosoft series\npython\noh my goodness what's the other book The\nreally popular python book\nit's python crash course and I can't\nremember the other one\numso when are we getting Kevin on for\nanother set of Ms demos Kevin\nbicep Kevin I shouldn't call him bicep\ncabin but we did bicep stuff together\nuh I don't know I'll have to ask what's\nhe what's he's up to\nthe first episode aired and was really\ngood apparently I'll have to check it\noutsome games doesn't work for keyword yep\nexactly\nneed that aim assistuh hey Daryl Thanks For Shame and infos\nwhat's up what's going on\nwhat game mode do you play on FIFA I\ndon't know the middle one what is that\nPro\nI can't remember what it is automate the\nboring that's the book I'm talking about\nyes automate the boring this is the\nother book\nuh\nbut I don't have the latest FIFA I have\nlike\n22.\n20 that's 23 is the latest one I don't\nhave the latest one\nand I don't play online because I don't\nwant to get owned by 12 year olds I just\nplay like\nclassic matches well it's kind of fun\nthough I used to play with olive and\nRichard we haven't done that in a while\nGPS your medical keep doing what you do\nthank you appreciate thatuh\nthe automated Python the Hard Way that's\none too but it's the one I'm thinking\nabout is automate the boring stuff\nbecause they're both by\num\nwhat is the yellow books publisher\ncalleduh I can't remember but that's the one\nI'm talking abouthey Glenn I just wondering for myself\nI'm doing some RCA and Incident\nManagement stuff recently was wanting to\nknow how well that translates to\nsomething like a cloud engineering\nposition\nIncident Management stuff I don't know\nwhat RCA is\nbecause someone told me about RC I could\nGoogle like this what is RCAuh root cause analysis okay cool recalls\nanalysis\nuh I want to know what that translate to\nsomething like Cloud engineer position\nand Incident Management stuff\nwhat part\nwhat part of a Houston Cloud engineerhow much what's your current experience\nwith what you do now like a couple yearsI could see it like maybe in like a\nniche\nMaybeuh maybe admin type stuff maybe maybe\neven security related type stuff depends\non what your current skill set is\nwhat update yeah automate the boring\nthat's the one I'm talking about\nyes no search Press thank you day they\nthey're the ones that make the yellow\nones the yellow books it's uh also the\num\nwhat's that Linux book that I love so\nmuch Linux basic for hackers I love that\nbook so much it's also by Northstar\npress\nI feel like they they have just like\nsuch quality books and pretty affordable\nas well\nhighly recommend\nno no not the dummies not the dummies no\nstarch no starch\nthe dummies ones are not always yellow\nright I think there's different colors\nfor that one or are they always yellow\nbut I'm talking about no search pressGPS working on Microsoft yep still at\nMicrosoft year and a half I mean I\nhaven't gotten a layoff notice today so\nas of right now\nas of right now I still work here yeah\nyeah yeah yeah so I don't know we'll man\nI don't know when I'll be able to like\nlet go of like let go sorry relief and\nbe like I'm not laid off but I know that\nI can feel that way today until I start\nwork tomorrow\nso there's that but yeah sell Microsoft\na year root cause analysis a year\num is that like can you tell me a little\nbit of like tools that you use I'm not\nvery familiar with it but if you let me\nknow what kind of like\nuh\nServices tools that you can deal with in\nthis role I can probably give you a\nbetter idea\num but I want to lean into saying like\nit might be something security or\nidentity based which is good\nyeah yeah Cloud sec I'm leaning it's a\npotentially Cloud SEC but not on\nuh stuff like uh what is it\nazure\nSentinel uh there's this other one I'm\nthinking I can't remember what it's\ncalled\ntype service\nI did RC engine management as the cloud\nUPS team so it depends company to\ncompany yeah\nthey're always yellow idiot's guide is\norange oh I didn't know the rose yellow\nI agree currently reading how Linux\nWorks Linux basic for hackers next\nhowlinx works is a great book as well\num if you want to have a better\nunderstanding of the operating system\nthe kernel\nsolid book I need to reread it for a\ncouple of streams that I'm doing in\nFebruarydated dog oh damn you should talk today\nis a data dog uh a data dogger\nsorry today Bay is a security engineer\nat oh no detection engineer a data dog\nuh so if your skill is to use datadog\nMicrosoft Defender yes that is what I'm\ntalking about Microsoft Defender\nuh but yeah you could probably get into\nsomething like Cloud security\nuh Microsoft Defender and Sentinel were\nthe services that I was talking about\nI think what you're I mean datadog is\nvery cloud-based uh yeah that skill set\nyou could I mean unless you don't want\nto get into securityuh I'm a data dog yeah day is a data\ndogger he has a YouTube channel if you\ngo to day cyber walks on YouTube You'll\nFind all this information and all his uhvideos and whatnot on on cloud security\nbut I have a feeling do you not want to\nget into security\nis that why you're trying to get into\nCloud engineering if you know your way\naround so observability is a big thing\nright\nso I'm assuming if you use something\nlike datadog you have some skill set\nwith understanding monitoring and\nobservability\nwhich is a big part of successful cloud\narchitecturesumso you would have to couple that with\nwhatever any other thing you want what I\nmean what Niche you want to get into so\nyou need to couple that it's like a big\npart of it but not\ndo you have any like programming skillsyeah we're mostly in the cloud all right\nso I feel like you're on a wayuh other data dog EPM traces are crucial\nfor fixing a broken app\ndays man check them out yeahcheck them out my background is mostly\nsecond networking okay so you have\nnetworking you have observability\nprobably need some if you have some\nscripting experience you have some\nprogramming experience if you have that\nand you are familiar do you have you\nworked inside of a cloud platform like\nhave you used something like AWS Azure\nbefore you might have everything you\nneed you just need to probably like\nmaybe get a project or two so you can\nfurther understand that skill set tailor\ntheir resume and cover letter you're\nprobably good plus you have experience\nthat's the hardest thing for people to\nget\num\nlearning react and JavaScript a bunch\nOkay soyou don't need react in JavaScript\nunless you want to be a web developer uh\nin the cloud you don't really need it\nlike unless you want to be a cloud\ndeveloper but even then they're so more\nfocused on making like Cloud native\napplications and a lot of that is like\nback-end stuff uh which probably isn't\nreacting JavaScript I mean I know you\ncan use these both front-end and back\nend but they're not really primarily\nmade for that\numso you might want to look into something\nlike python or\ngo or dot net\nlike that\nwhat a chat we're about to hit 60. do me\na favor hit a like let's hit I still\nwant to hit 100. I have big goals people\nI have big goals and Big Dreams uh so\nyeahwhat up Ethan how you doingwell I got an emailI'm on high alert chatcurious if you're consider doing update\nversion average Cloud resume.net through\nwas retired in December so following\nyour God it's a bit tricky on my GitHub\nI have updated version I've done it six\nI don't know if I've done it seven I've\ndone it six so the.net version I have an\nupdated uh my guide my repo itself is\nusing.net sex\num\nI unfortunately don't have the ability\nto edit like the blog post or the\nYouTube video or on the cloud resume but\nthe.net code has been updated in my\nrepos if you check it outum\nI don't think I would do an update like\na whole version of it thoughhumble bone bill has great Book Sales I\nthink I once saw the combo of the Linux\ncommand line uh Linux basic for hackers\nand how Linux works that there's three\nthat is like the trio that you need for\nLinux uh I saw that once on sale but I\nhad the books already before so I had to\nbuy it but I share that to everyone this\nwas a couple months ago so there's no\nway that it's a thing anymore but those\nthree books honestly if you pick those I\nmean I think individually they're like\n20 to 25 dollars recommend so much it's\nbeen those time like times going through\nall those books you'll have such a solid\nknowledge with bash and Linux highly\nrecommendsuper Niche thing making an Azure devops\nUA space extension nowadays in react but\nthat's super Niche skill set yeah super\nnicheuh super super Niche I feel like\nI I could see that beinga helpful\nbut also I don't knowI haven't heard of any company like\ntrying like the need for thatbut then again\nI also worked on like a portal that was\nsort of like a UI for SQL\nso and then some people would be like\nwhy you don't need a UI for that but\nthey needed it in this case so it was\nmadeshould web developers learn Cloud yeah\n100 because where do your web apps end\nup\nin some kind of cloud technology\ndoesn't have to be AWS Azure gcp but\nit'd have to be somewhere right\nso just understanding like you know what\nis a successful Cloud app look like it's\nimportant you don't necessarily have to\nbe like certified though it would help I\nthinkit's trying to move from service desk to\nAzure still trying to figure out my path\nbit by bit path bit path but\nyour videos are really helpful thank you\nappreciate thatnetwork engineer with some sprinkle of\nsecurity too I want to move to cloud and\nmaybe even devops for remote work\nespecially working from oversea like\nEurope\num or Southern East Asia possibleokay so I mentioned this at the\nbeginning but\nuh hold on let me just text me\nyou can come get it if you need toso I mentioned the remote aspect of any\nrole has nothing to do with the role\nitself it's more or the industry itself\nit's more company company you can work\nin the tech industry which is remote\nfriendly but work at a company that\ndoesn't allow you to work remotely\nthat's more a team thing organization\nteam thing company thing it's not\nspecific to the role itself Cloud roles\ncan be done remotely but not are not all\nare done by that there's going to be a\nbunch of reasons why a company would or\nwould not want to be a remote uh some of\nthem make sense some of them might not\nsome of them may be fair some of they\nmight not I'm not here to\njudge that but it's more so like\nyou know when you're applying to a role\nask that question or maybe it's in the\ndescription or maybe you can find other\npeople talking about that role or\nsomething like thatit was very helpful for when people\nfolks are trying to do git flow across\n15 repos like it was asafe delivery train or something needed\nto create branches appear as a\ncoordinate anyway each time I made that\nthat's cool\nsounds like umum\nI know like GitHub has a pretty good UI\nfor that\nso pretty interestingsad news to all those have been affected\nyou will get through this yeah I mean we\nneed to send positive vibes\none thing I will say is that if I do get\nlaid off I'll definitely stream\nbut I don't expect me to be like I can't\nbelieve I got laid off this is BS no\num you're never going to see that kind\nof emotion out of me publicly privately\nperhaps but that's between\nthe people that I know in person and\nprivately but on stream no but I I feel\nlike if I'm\ndoing a live stream\nwhen it hasn't happened to me but sort\nof like having some space for other\npeople to talk and if it does happen to\nme I should do it as well it's like when\nI failed my certificate like Linus\ncertification like I was\nupset but I felt like sharing it was\nalso as important as sharing the failure\nwas\nfeeling the bad news was as important as\nsharing the good newsthey just sub nice\nlook at youbetween you and your cat yeah the cat\nthe cat knows all the secrets the cat\ncat my partner are the ones who always\nfind out oh my emotions firstI gotta get a click bait laid off from\nMicrosoft yeah you're gonna see me being\nlike it's gonna say like I was laid off\nfrom Microsoft and it's gonna be me and\nlike I don't know like a pose like like\nthis or like maybe there's like a\nteardrop or something like that\nforeign\nsomething like that\nsometimes I do think of like oh what\nwould I do if I got laid off\num would be an interesting uh scenario\nfor sure it's not like I'm hoping it\nhappens or I look forward to it\ndefinitely not but\nI like to believe that I have the type\nof character that will\nalways figure whatever happens out so\nif anything it's just another experience\nrightyeah red arrows everywhere like\nI don't know like the Microsoft logo and\nlike an X or like a thumbs down\nsomething like thatbest way to learn git GitHub\num\npersonal projects like\neven if you are the only person working\non a project like you should have good\ngood practices using branches and things\nlike that committing your code uh no\nmatter what you should have it in some\nsort of git Repository\nonline get request sorry\nwell there are a bunch of resources out\nthere too yeah\nuh free code Camp has a good video John\nsays that Daryl says mosh has a good\nGitHub video too\na lot of programming books will teach\nyou git as well like I know the python\ncrash course and automate the boring I\nhave some git lessons in them\nuh so yeah\nif you do the cloud resume you\ndefinitely need to have get in GitHub\nuh skill set there\nso there's that\nI earlier on I went through a bunch of\nquestionsyou have some so you have some AWS\nexperience just go back to Austin some\nAWS experience some programming\nexperience some\nobservability experience you kind of\nevery little piece I think you probably\nhave to couple that with a little bit\nmore of like other areas Cloud so\num like understanding different compute\noptions maybe do like do the cloud\nresume that'll give you a good feel for\nuh different types of services in the\ncloud uh should be good thereuh maybe a project or two would be good\njust watched your CSA video with Kathy\ndo you know anyone on the technical CSA\nnetworking not a certain engineer CSA\nthat you could interview as well\nyou know anyone on the technical CSA not\nsoftware Engineers you say that you can\ninterview as well\nyou like someone who does networking as\na CSAprobably I'll ask Kathy to tell me one\nof her colleagues who I can interview\nso\nI think her whole team is software\nEngineers though\nso that might not be the right\nand then I would have to go poke around\nto see csas that are not sales\nthat implement but do networking\num I would have to go see or may she\nmight have\nmembers on her team that\nhave a strength in networking but\nthey're all software engineersdid you mention Consulting as possible\noption A while back if you were laid off\nyou could do that too maybe in your\nfreelance yeah maybeput I don't know\nI'm at an interesting point in my career\nwhere it's like I don't know what the\nnext step is regardless ofum\nregardless of layoff happening or not so\nI've been in my role like a year almost\nan hour a year anda year and six months uh\nand around this time is where I\nhistorically have been like okay what's\nthe next moveum so yeah I don't really know part of\nme wants to go back to like a cloud\nengineer gig\npart of me wants to try something new\nlike a cloud social architect role I\njust don't want to do anything with\nsales so that's a little tricky finding\nthose kinds of roles part of me wants to\nstay in advocacy and just move up the\nranks there\numpart of me wants to take a break\nI would lie if I if I didn't mention\nthat\num\nyeah I don't know I don't know what's\nnext I really really don't\num\nI guess that's why it's great and it's\nalso to be in a it's a better position\nto be in where like you're trying to\nfigure that out now\num with while being employed\num then trying to figure it out when you\nyou're not employed definitely\num yeah I don't know\nbecause something sounds interesting\num\nbut it's just not I don't know we'll\nhave to seeyou will be you'll be excellent at sales\nMaybe\nmy um\nmy mom told me the other day that I\ncould sell salt salt to a slug which I\nfind an interesting thing to say about\nme butI don't know it's just not something\nthat I'm very much interested in I\nbut it could be so I don't know\na bunch of Auto knows today\nI like I I think I would love to be on\nsomething similar to what Kathy does\nlike this\nit was really loud bike outside and my\nwindows open\num like a class solution architect that\nis implementing an engineering not doing\nsales because we're hitting quotas is\njust something that I don't want to doit's just don't\nthat's just nothing I don't want to\nworry about especially with the maybe\nwhen the economy is great maybe\ncool but no I just\nnot something\nit says about building relationship\nrelationship building and you're doing\nit here yeah that's what I'm saying I'm\nalready doing it here I don't want to do\nit for workyeahuh let's seetaking a look at what I skipped hereumI think I got all of these questions I\nthink earlier on I might have skipped\nbecause I was like flying through them\nall right I'm gonna go back\nyeah it was very stressful and someone\nover to control which is the sucky part\nyeahbut then there's the flip side of that\nif you make one sale that hits your\nquota then you're like goodright\num\nwhich I guess if you're really good at\nthen it could be something beneficial\nbut\nit's not something I\nlook forward to it's not something that\nI wake up like oh I want to do that\nversus like going back to Cloud\nengineering or going into\num software engineer type CSA like those\nthings I look forward to but maybe it's\nbecause I'm familiar with those things\nmaybe it's because it's the unknown that\nI'm like oh I don't know\nI'll be like my I feel like that my\nlong-term goal is to be open\nis to open my own kind of development\ncompany I would love to open\nI would I mean honestly dream dream\nwould be to turn learn to Cloud into\nsomething that somehow makes money\num without\nclosing the the educational material\nI don't know what that looks like\num\nlike I wanted to be free for people to\nlearn but it somehow makes money but I\ndon't know what that looks like uh\nyeah so I don't know we'll seedo you need to learn scripting before\ntaking any cloud training\nthe murder the majority of people in\ncourse makers will probably tell you no\nbut I think yes\nI think knowing bash for cloud is\nessential absolutely essential which is\nwhy I'm making a bash course which will\nbe free so I'm not trying to sell you\nanything\nit's going to be on YouTube\nquota meeting stress is real yeah\nespecially like at the last like what if\nyou don't hit it and you're like the\nlast week then you're like gonna end up\ntrying to sell anything\nthoughts on this being an I.T is like\nplaying through an RPG as one class\nbuild soldier for example and realizing\nlater that you should have been a wizardyeah oh my goodnessand then you can and then like your\nplayer can be killed off for no reason\nkilled because it's the analogy of a\nvideo game but in this context I mean\nlike late being laid off as in like you\nremoved from your career for whatever\nreasonit's kind of crazy like this is like the\nstuff that we put ourselves because\nlayoffs are not anything new right\nlayout stuff's always happened but it's\nkind of crazy that we like\nthere are periods where this is just\nhappens like it's like a part\nof the the jobit looks like millions of pop-up ads oh\nmy goodnessWildscripting is including the cloud pilot\nis super useful plus it'll make learning\nprogramming easier because program it is\nprobably yeah scripting is programming\nbecause you have variables functions\nLoops uh conditions which is all the\nbasics of programming then you have to\nput something like well I guess depends\non the type of programming but the most\none of the most popular ones object\noriented programming which you can learn\nwith something with like little language\nafter bash but even being able to do\nsimple like redirection or pipelines or\nso putting commands together it's very\nuseful in the context of like a cloud\nCLI\nso yeah there's that\nhow do you learn new things at this\nlevel when you're career factoring and\nthe fear of the unknown I don't know I\nfeel like a lot of what I learned now is\nmore so a lot very much aligned with\nwhat I'm doing currently but at the same\ntime it's stuff that I would I could\npotentially see myself doing long term\nlike for example it's like a lot like\nthis this month with bash like upgrading\nmy bash skills um\nand then next month is a lot of like\noperating system Linux type stuff uh so\nhow Linux runs in Azure how Linux works\nand like an overview of WSL like that's\nkind of like the focus for this month of\nnext month but I also think those skills\nare something that I'm going to be able\nto use no matter what I do next like if\nI want to be uh in advocacy but specific\nto open source and Linux then this will\nbe uh important for that like if you all\nsaw the interview that I did today with\nKathy Lee like she mentioned that bash\nis something she used every single day\nas a class solution architect so me\nupskilling there is great as well I\ndefinitely want to do some more\ncontainers and kubernetes stuff because\nshe also mentioned that kubernetes is\njust something that she sees and the\nmajority of her in customer engagements\nso I'm definitely upskilling in that but\nI like to think of like I guess that's a\ngood thing about my current role is the\nflexibility to kind of upskill whatever\nI want\num but then that's also like you have\nthe what's what is it called the Paradox\nof choice where you can choose anything\nso it makes it more difficult\nyeah\num\nI guess that's how I do itoh hold on what was this I think it's\njust keeping up keeping up emerging\nTechnologies somewhat I did this video\nabout habits\nthat I set my goal for what I want to\nlearn so like I mentioned bash this\nmonth\noperating system Linux next month\num and then I stick to that if if like a\nnew like the new ladies and greatest\nCloud thing comes out next week like\nI'll read about it like I'll I listen to\npodcasts like I listen to the cloud cast\nand a couple other podcasts that kind of\nkeep me informed but I don't go in\nRussian do tutorials on them because I\nfind that once the hype is down and then\nyou go and revisit these topics it makes\na lot\nit's a lot more sense and oftentimes you\nrealize like it wasn't really worth\ninvesting that much time into that\nso I like to have like a plan decided in\nlike three months in advance or three\nmonths at a time\num\nthat way I'm not pulling a billion other\ndirections all the time\nI don't work at Cloud at all but from\nwhat I research I believe you're\nthinking Pi Than A bash need for\nautomation I think that gets used yep\n100.\nto maximum employees know if they have\nbeen laid off yet and if so which roles\nare hit the most I don't know\nI I don't know\nuh are we getting I know some people\nknow and that they've and I not only\nknow that because they've been sharing\non like social media\nare we getting to a point though where\nAI will start to become a serious threat\nyeah\nthat's so I mean yeah I I think right\nnow the immediate kind of opportunity is\npeople understanding how to leverage it\num but you know there's no avoiding\nthat's going to automate some kind of\nroles I don't know what but it\ndefinitely willread income while keeping content free\nDr Chuck\nand his python for everyone of course\nhas managed to do that you can pay for\nthe course on Coursera I'll watch it\nminus a few things on YouTube\nyeah that's\nthat's an interesting play I don't want\nto make courses thoughyeah that's the thing I don't I don't\nhave much interest in making courses\neven though everyone tells me make a\ncourse make a course even my partner the\nother day was like make a course\nshould make a course\nI don't want to make a course\nI'm making this bash course\nbut I don't I don't want my course to be\nmy\nincome or my profession because then\nit's like\nthat's what I have to spend my time\ndoing like updating my course like like\nor my courses or whatever like that's\nnot what I want to do not now at least\nsometime in the future maybe but not nowI'm going to hurt clashing your job\nshould I put previous offer to build\njobs Myers my one thousand percent\nI have four years experience in Cloud\nengineer\nwait what\nyou're already a cloud engineer you're\ngoing for a college in your job\nI'm a little confused thereto me and I have four years experience\nin a software engineer job\nwell I worked at helpless I was already\nseeing things like Microsoft autopilot\nbeing rolled out the only jobs to worry\nabout repetitive ones\nalways be upskilling do Azure service\nrun at the Linux\ndo Azure servers Run online Linux oh\nlike what makes up of azure like\nwhat Azure runs on yeah most likely like\nthings like um\nAKs after kubernetes service runs on\nLinux runs on our own Dish show it's\ncalled\num\nwhat's called Mariner something like\nthat I'm probably not pronouncing it\ncorrectly\num\nyeah so that runs on that in AKs is a\nbig part of azure I'm sure there's a lot\nmore and I know there's a lot of Linux\nworkloads like over 50 of of compute in\nAzure that is deployed on Azure is Linux\nand this was something that I saw back\nfrom back from 2020 so three years now\nthat's definitely way up there I don't\nknow maybe 60 65 percentcan I get an email notifications of your\nLive Events yeah you have to hit the\nlittle like on my channel you can put\nnotifications and then you put all\nnotifications and then that'll give an\nemail whenever I go livethat being said help desk will not be\nfully replaced to certain aspects of it\nallowing to promise to downside their\napartmentyes correctuh\nwhat up Kev\nmake a course one of us no I don't want\nto make a course not now later maybe\nmaybe next year or something I don't\nknow\nhow come Microsoft doesn't create its\nown limit we do have our own Linux\nposition it's called let me let me look\nat it Microsoft MarinerCBL Mariner\nhere it is\nthis is what powers AKsboomyou mentioned not going to content\ncreation full time in a previous live\nstream but you also talked about being\nan educator which you already are would\nyou ever consider doing that\nuh yeah teaching maybe but then I feel\nlike that goes back to like\nmaking a course\nuh I don't think I'd ever be like a\ntraditional teacher just because I would\nhave to go to school I would have to\nlike\nget a bachelor's and then get like\ncontinue like a Masters or something to\nteach at like certain schools\numso if anything maybe it'd be like a\nfull-time YouTuber but I don't really\nhave any interest in that either\nhonestly if I were to if I were not to\ndo the roles that I mentioned already\nbeing interested in I would love to like\nlive off Investments or live off or go\nto a farm and live there or something\nlike thatwhat search should I get before I try to\nget my Azure shirt\nuh Linux Essentialsand the Azure do the 104 so you get some\nnetworking experience too that's the\nLinux to showthat powers Azure kubernetes serviceuh let's seeQuinn if sitting for an interview for an\nentry-level Cloud role an interview\nlooks at credentials in your opinion\nwhich you think would be more impressive\na plus a Linux\nall day lfcs is a hard one I failed that\none\nI didn't pass and then I went for the\nessentials because the essentials is\nmore than enough for like basic Cloud\nrole\nheck yeah a plus\nalso isn't CompTIA like raising their\nprices also we hit 70 live viewers\nappreciate y'all let's go 30 more to 100\nlet's go\nokay like hit me with a like on the\nStream\nlet's try to hit 100 we're at 70 right\nnowLinux Foundation certified system\nadministrator that's what that stands\nfor right\nsolid solidification\none thousand percent more useful than a\nplus also a plus is Raising its prices I\nsaw that I think Kev Tech shared that\ncrazy it's already pretty expensive\nI don't see this is a hot take don't\nhate me but I do not see how any of the\nconcierge are worth it for cloud for\nother roles potentially for cloud I just\ndon't see it\nI just don't see it I don't think I\ncould do teaching as I worry about\ngrowing out of touch of the industry yes\noh my goodness thank you this is why I\ndon't want to be a full-time YouTuber or\ndedicate my time to making courses all\nthe time because\nif I can't get Hands-On firsthand\nexperience with customers or Solutions\nor production\nhow am I supposed to stay in\nstay updated with stuff right now what\nI'm trying to do and what I'm actually\ndoing now is\nmaking learn a cloud a full Cloud native\nin production application and it's\nalready\nbut let's take a look here hold on let\nme show you my screenuh learn to Cloudwait I was gonna go to the portal hold\nonuh\npresent share screen share screen\nthis yearall right so learn to cloud in the last\nthis is five minutes has 807 sight hits\nand let's take a look at the resource\nGroup\nand let's take a look at the cost\nanalysisso so far\nwe havecome on third oh no it's gonna hit forty\ndollars so rishab was right he said that\nthis is this number is going to be\ncloser to 50 by the end of the\nthe end of the month I said around I\nthink I said around 30 sorry my\nestimation is already done so far it's\ncalled 7.19 to have this deployed in\nAzure uh learn the cloud but anyway my\ngoal my goal is\nto build learn to Cloud into a full\nCloud native in production it's already\nin production but it's not it's like\nit's not 100 implemented everything that\nI want uh that way when I do\nsort of do more like educational things\nthat I'm building them off and in\nproduction app that I maintain that I\nbuild I'm essentially the cloud engineer\nfor this project and that way I will\nalways have sort of an in production app\nto work with to work on because that is\nmy one issue like if I ever want to\nbecome like a YouTuber full-time or\neveryone to become a content creator of\nthe full-time something like that like\nwhat will I work with in production\nso that's what I'm trying towork on now for the future kind of thinguh where did I movethe concierge price hacks is what's\nmaking me reconsider\ncrazy I think I mean they're already too\nexpensive I think computers only worth\nif you're trying to break into specific\nareas without formal education since\nthey are so well known I remember they\nsaid you should get it they told me that\nI should get a help desk to get helpless\ndog health desk job I needed a plus and\nI bought the a plus book and it was like\nthis massive book and then the first\ncouple chapters are like what is a mouse\nwhat is a USB port and I was like F this\nand then I just applied to a bunch of\nhelpless jobs\nthe thing about me is that I've always\nbeen really good at interviewing so I\nlanded a role but I don't know I just\ncould not put myself through studying\nthat not saying there's anything wrong\nwith the certification just saying like\nit's just something that I couldn't do\nbut I could see it being helpful for\nsureuh is a CompTIA Linux plus an awsaa\nenough to get a job uh Cloud job if I do\nHands-On Labs her experiences coming\nfrom non-technical background uh maybe\nuh why don't you want to do something\nlike a support role for like a year you\ndo a support role and you couple that\nwith projects and the certifications I\nthink you have a pretty solid chance\nbut coming completely from scratch is\nyou know you're up you're up with a lot\nof people who are trying to transition\ninto clouds people who have other types\nof technical experience so it's it's\ntough right\nthe problem with con tip is that it's a\nmonopoly every company asks for CompTIA\na plus and the IT support I hope that's\nGary you can still get you can still get\nhired with home labs yeah I mean it's\njust been around longer\nactually it's funny just before I left\nmy old job at an MSP my college\nprofessor started working there on a\ntenure so he doesn't get out of touch\nbut my college brother started working\nthere on a tenure so he does yeah see\nI feel like it's tough to like not kind\nof get out of touch if you're fully\ndedicated to\ncreating technical content\nyeahDaryl 100 Kevinborderline scam CompTIA man I also that\nwas the I I tell people the story all\nthe time I had negative 200 I remember\nit so vividly I remember opening up my\nBank of America app on my phone\nso vividly seeing negative two hundred\ndollars and around this time was also\nwhen I needed to pay for that Conti\nassert because I didn't have a job and\nand obviously no one would pay for it\nand I was like there's no way I can\nafford this\nno way\nuh yeah keeping up with industry is a\nfull-time YouTuber might be a big tricky\nI'm still figuring out what up tag with\nLucy shout out Tech with Lucy I know\nthis is something that you're working on\nnow yeah\num just one of the reasons why I don't I\ndon't want to do it I I I I also really\ndo love the fact that I get to be on\nkind of like random engineering projects\nat Microsoft\num and it's cool you get to work with\ndifferent Engineers\num in terms of like you know leveling\nyour skill set up it's always great you\nget to meet new people fantastic I just\nfeel likeI would isolate myself from a lot of\nwhat I really do enjoy if I did content\nfull-time so\nit's just not something for me now yeah\nI was lucky to get my first help this\njob without it I mainly got it because\neveryone I would I would be working with\nwas trained under the same guyI Got A Plus network plus server plus\nbut when I read through job description\nI feel like I don't know anything\nsorry that was funny because because\nit's like one of the realest comments\never it's like you go and you study for\ncertifications and then you realize like\noh they're asking for something\ncompletely differentyeah that's why I constantly tell people\nlike certifications and I I\ncertifications are not the answer they\njust they just are not\nthey're not the answer to Landing a job\nno their lands they're they're an answer\nfor some people to learn one thousand\npercent but I feel like since there's\nthis whole there's this hole now\num industry around certifications uh\nwhether that be courses whether that be\nboot camps whether that be like the\ncertification interesting in in it of\nitself like people make money off of\nthis so the push to like get certified\nget service get certified is because it\nmakes other people money now it also is\nvery useful for people who need like\nvery structured like an outline and I've\nused certifications before 100 but I\njust feel like because it's like\nlet's call it Big certification is\npushing you to go get more and more more\nyou spend less time really studying for\none deeply and mindfully where you end\nup just memorizing and then when it goes\nto kind of showcase your skill set you\ndon't really know\nmuch because it's like oh you only like\nstudied in a quick fashionwhat I will say is if you have this\nframework like the other day I posted on\non my community tab or it's like if you\ndo like like let's say you do like a\nfundamental certification then you go\nand do a project that builds off what\nyou learned there and then you go do a\ncertification like an associate level\ncertification that builds off that\nprevious project and then you go to a\nproject that builds off the associate\ncertification I think that is a\nfantastic framework but that is\nsomething that you cannot get done in\nlike a month or two months and another\nissue is like you constantly see\nYouTubers talking about like top paying\ncertifications you constantly see\nLinkedIn posts it's like oh I just got\ncertified in every new week every week\nthey have a canoe certification a bunch\nof stuff like that right\nlike it's like and\nsort of the mindset we have around them\nis like oh I need to do more and more\nmore where it's like no what you need to\ndo is couple them with other things\nprojects certifications awesome great\nway better for your resume but alone\nthey really don't do much\nI think I spent my first AWS\ncertification like it's my only AWS\ncertification which is my AWS certified\ndeveloper associate I took six months\nlike hold on let me show you guys this\nlet me show you that let me find this\nfirst\num six months and I oh my goodness I\nremember passing that certification and\nbecause it had taken me so long I\nremember walking out I remember that I\nremember the the the place that I took\nit was in like I don't know why it felt\nlike it was in the middle of this Forest\nbut Connecticut Everything feels like\nit's in the middle of a forest the\nparking lot it was so empty because I\ntook it later because they took it after\nmy help desk gig it was like six o'clock\nand I remember running out of my car I\nwas like yeah my life is about to\nchange\num mainly because I like suffered a lot\num to study it but then again I don't\nthink you ever hear of someone saying\nlike oh I took six months to study of\nher class certification now it's like\nunheard of hold on I need to find this\nI'm going to show you my notes\noh here we go I'm gonna show you so you\ncan see how long it took me to to study\nbecause I'm not I'm not I'm not here to\nlie to y'all\num\nokay hold on\nwe're at 80 80 live years let's hit 100\npeople please\ndo me a favor and hit a like on that uh\nstream oh hold on let me minimize this\nI will do this we'll do this\nall right take a look these are my AWS\nCSA and I guess at some point I know CDA\nand at some point I'd start\num\nsetting for the CSA uh and I guess I\nheard that there's like a lot of overlap\nright\nso yeah this took me six months to put\ntogether it's like an entire PDF let's\ngo to the bottom I don't remember how\nmany pages is in here 61 Pages y'all 61\npages of all my notes of just studying\nfor this darn certification I'm a big\nNote Taker uh I've been using notion\nsince\nit came out pretty much so I have this\navailable I have like even diagrams in\nherewhere is it\nlike oh look at this I don't even\nremember where I got this from I don't\nremember where I took this from but\num\nlike it took me for I just remember\nstudying every single day two hours\nafter the darn help desk gig after\ndriving an hour\ncommuting because he obviously helped us\nbecause not really well that helped us\ngig wasn't really remote uh remote\nfriendlyI remember this also studying for the\ncertification was the first time that I\ndid stuff with like AWS Lambda and I was\nlike this is so cool\nso I guess my serverless uh my\nenthusiasm for serverless was even back\nthen later on I got like a bunch of\nexperience with Azure functions which is\ngreat\num oh my goodnesssix six months y'all I signal is a notes\nright here\ncan you imagine if I if I was worried\nabout making LinkedIn posts all the time\nabout studying I would have never been\nable to put something like this together\nI've never I don't I mean I probably\nwould have passed but\nI feel like the social aspect of this\nupskillings cloud is is this is a lot of\npressure on that to like make daily make\ndaily updates make daily daily videos\nmake oh like daily LinkedIn posts and\nthings like that and I just I'm so glad\nthat that wasn't what I had I had put\nmyself through when I was learning\nbecause it would have just had me so\ndistracted don't get me wrong in my\ncloud study plan let me find that too\nmade made by oh my goodness I can't top\nmy own made by GPS\nsix months Cloud study pan I do highly\nrecommend that you do a where is it I\nfactored in three days for each facial\ndocumentation purposes use them but\nthat's after spending uh like in this\ncase two weeks on like your bash skill\nset and then spending three days making\na video or making a blog post for the\nnetworking Parts after spending two\nweeks like it's not like every day uh\nafter python spending five weeks after\nCloud platform spending six weeks after\nterraform spending two weeks after\nDocker spending two weeks like\nI factored in into this plan three days\nat each phase to go and you do something\nthat synthesizes the information but\nlike doing it every day would have been\nway too distracting way way too\ndistracting\nuh let's see here\noh my goodness I talk so much that I\nmissed so many questions here\nwhat up Nicholas how you doingI don't want to push CompTIA hate but I\njust have such a sour taste for that\ncertification because\nI couldn't afford it\ngetting out of the army I was told\ndefinitely get SEC Plus for that special\nshirt requirement DOD okay that's fair\ncertain government roles absolutely\nrequire\nuh certain certifications\nbut I I've never had any interest of\nworking on the government and especially\nafter talking to Kathy and she talks\nabout working for the government because\nshe's worked for the government and the\ninterview that it's on my YouTube\nchannel I'm like especially don't want\nto work for the government after that\nthough\nI could see why people love the\nstability and kind of like will put up\nwith whatever the role requires for the\nstability 100 is just something I have\nno interest doing\ndid you get any type of four-year\ncollege degree before working at Cloud\nnope I am a College Dropout I did two\nsemesters of systems engineering in\nEcuador because I was living in Ecuador\nat that time and then I dropped out and\nthen I moved back here to the USwhenever I feel I'm feeling lazy I watch\nyour videos for motivation oh well I'm\nglad to be a source of motivation for\nyou\nwe're 16 away from 100 y'all do me a\nfavor hit a like on that let's get to\n100.\nI remember I don't know if anyone here\nused to was subbed into my channel\nreally early on when I used to do live\nstreams and like two people would watch\ntwo people three people would watch so\nnow the fact that I could potentially\nreach 100 people watching while I'm just\nsitting here talking about\nstuff that I've been through when it\ncomes to this class stuff is insane but\nI really do appreciate it so it's\nfreaking awesome guess on a day where\ni'm like worried about being laid off\nit's nice to have this kind of uh\nsupport from such an awesome Community\nI'm just checking my email again because\nI just got a notification but it's not\nmy work email it's my personal email so\nawesomesee I did a support role internship for\nonly two months and I've been working on\nlots of projects and such I hope I can\nbreak into Cloud scene\nyou got to be comfortable you gotta be\nso comfortable with the rejection\nI I did a video on the roles I rejected\non and I and after I did it and like\nuploaded it I remember a bunch of other\nroles that I forgot to add like the\nGoogle one\nbut at some point when you when you stop\nmaking the rejections personal you can\nreally learn a lot from them but more\nimportantly the patience in the\nperseverance that you get from it\nlike 100 such a valuable lesson um but\njust also understand thatit's just\neveryone goes through it some people\nwill go through it more some people have\nconnections that help them land that\nfirst role uh and whatever but yeah we\nall go through it so if that helps you\nfeel a little less worse about it\nhopefully\ndidn't know that competeers I didn't\nknow that about comptia's Linux plus how\ndoes that compare to lfcs is that is\nthat like Network Plus versus czna in\nterms of renown\nI don't know how the Linux plus compares\nto lfcs but I feel like the Linux\nFoundation One do you get like a retake\nI think you might get a retake on that\nfor the price\num again because my mindset with\ncertifications is it's not for having it\non my resume it's for which one is going\nto teach me the the better like the\nbetter stuff that's where I come fromwhat is a mouse or an essay yeah I\ncouldn't go through those questions I\ncould notclose is one of the Linux institution\nshirts only also get you the Linux plus\nsince they are the same thing I didn't\nknow that\ndid not know that\ngot my net plus proportion points and\nthen SEC Plus for job applications and\nwent to get hired at a repair shop and\nthey said kick Rock whatwhat there's got to be some conspiracy\ntheory here with CompTIA\nthat's crazy how so you have sec plus\nand net plus but because you don't have\na plus which I'm pretty sure SEC plus\nand Netflix are way harder than a plus\nyou can't go for itI'm working in security and my team's\ntransitioning to Cloud what sir would\nyou recommend getting and working in\nsecurity transitioning Cloud security\nwise the clouds the cloud cloud security\ncertifications right\num\ngo to day's Channel day cyber walks day\nif you're in here drop your YouTube\nchannel\num\nthere he has certifications that he\nrecommends for people going in security\nbut if you're already in cloud and\nmoving into Cloud security probably one\nof the specializations like there's like\nthe SC 900s sc200s for Azure I don't\nknow what the equivalents are in the\nother clouds uh that will probably be of\nbetter benefit to you\nthis is from someone from a military I.T\nbackground if the organization is going\nto cover the cause it's well worth the\nCompTIA effect as it made each of my\ninterviewers see that I'm a solid CIS\nadmin ah interesting\nif you can get it paid for might be\nworth it but if you can get other\ncertifications paid forit's always likeyeah that's all I guess that's a tough\nthing too is that I can recommend\nsomething but it's not Universal it's\nall my opinion\nuh but if you think they're worth it and\nyou want to get them\nsee if someone else can pay for them\nbig facts there\nstarted stacking with no skills is no\nbueno factsuh\n[Music]can't remember the last time I had to\npay for a certification where I didn't\nget it paid back gotta start summer butt\ngrateful for this Pacers even my help\ndesk gig paid for certifications\none thousand percent which is I feel\nlike I'll there's a bunch of help desk\ngigs out there that are very aware that\nthey are\nroles like stepping stone rolls for\npeople so they do their best to treat\ntheir people good and like pay them like\nthey helped us gig I think it was like a\nthousand dollars a year that you can use\non books and courses and certifications\nwhich is great so I use that to pay for\nmy AWS one\nuh but yeah ask ask if you can get this\nas a benefit also my sis admin gig\num I could I got Linux Academy paid by\nmy employer like they put it on their\ncredit card but they didn't have like an\nofficial way of asking for this or like\nsubmitting it somewhere\num so if you could just ask it's worth\nit like\nthat the like very least what are you\ngonna get like a no\nwhat up Mike uh what are your favorite\nprogramming languages\nI mean I know the most csharp.net\nso I guess that's my favoritea mouse is something Tom chases in ssds\nisyeah they're paying for it so I'm\nlooking to Choose Wisely facts do your\nresearch do your research\nI would say\ngo for very targeted certifications for\nsure\ndon't just go and get the ones that\npeople are like top 10 paying\ncertifications now do the ones that are\nbest gonna make most sense for you in\nyour career rightuh I got my SEC plus from the Air Force\noh thank you for your service uh the\nother person who mentioned they were in\nthe military as well\num\nfor you too and the a plus Netflix from\ngoing with oh going with for my\nbachelor's at WGU I work as a semi now\nbut I like to work at solution learning\nAWS or linuxb best Bash one thousand\npercent no matter which Cloud you end up\nlearning but you had a bachelor's that's\ngreat\nand you have this Adam experience\nfantastic do you have do you do any do\nyou do any Powershell as a sysadmin\nor bash as a CIS admin\nbut yeah I usually recommend so to kind\nof be like\nuh have a solid foundation for a cloud\nskill set it's it's bash networking\nscripting oh wait no batch of scripting\nbash networking programming Cloud\nplatform DeVos fundamentals that will\ngive you a well-rounded curriculum to go\nand Conquer your first Cloud admin role\nCloud engineer role\num entry level cloud role whatever they\ncall them againwhich is why that's why I learned a\ncloud is is divided up in that so if you\nall are not familiar let me share my\nscreen again\nI feel like the majority of people are\nprobably familiar with it in the first\nplace but uh\nswitch here switch here\nthis is not learning cloud\nlearn to Cloud this is learn to Cloud\nthis is the open source Guide to the\nfundamentals of cloud computing uh\npowered by Azure now\nshout out to my current employer\nsomeone asked me the other day like if\nyou worked for AWS or gcp would you end\nup moving learn to Cloud to them and\nhonestly probably because I would get\nfree credits and then I wouldn't have to\npay for it so\nwe'll see but anyway learn to cloud is\nexactly what it says here it's a guide\nuh in the goal is to provide an outline\nof skills you will need to learn to get\ninto cloud computing so that's why the\nphases are if you're starting from\nabsolutely no Tech experience here or\ntech knowledge\num\nabout networking programming Club\nplatform Davison rentals Cloud security\nfundamentals uh learn to cloud.guide is\nthe website and then this will tell you\neverything you need to know so for\nexample phase one how why does it why\ndoes this skill set matter to Cloud\num how you can break this down any\nresources that I found useful and\nprojects that I find useful and things\nthat you should be familiar with the end\nof the space certain commands that you\nshould be familiar with networking\nConcepts\num bash scripting Concepts and then any\ncertifications you might want to look\ninto and it's the same kind of outline\nwhy it's relevant resources projects\nbreakdown Concepts you should be\nfamiliar with certifications for every\nsingle phase so programming so\nprogramming Cloud platform double\nsettlements Cloud security shout out day\nuh day is the person who wrote phase\nfive\nand talks about like an introduction to\nCloud security here as well\nso be sure to check that outall right let's do this last ones I'm\ngettingtiredoh my goodness I\nhey takealusian Joy shout out Tech with\nLucy killing it\num big fans we're big fans of tackle\nLucy herelooks a lot like I looks a lot or it\nlooks a lot organized in my nose I\ncrammed on my 104 notes into single note\nnotepad plus plus come on\nwell how great is no pad plus plus for\nformatting I feel like I don't need\nsuper fancy formatting for my notes I\nknow some people make them like super\naesthetic which is awesome I can't do\nthat but I need to have at least titles\nand stuff like that\nwhat degree track were you in at WGU\nshout out WGU\nevery time when I think like I should go\nback and finish school the only school\nthat I would do is WGU like their cloud\ncomputing track but I'm also at a point\nwhere like it just won't make a\ndifference in my career it's only going\nto be something that I do for the\nexperience of going back to school and\nsomething that's going to cost me money\num I there's I don't think there's any\nway that it would make a bachelor's\nwould make an impact in my career now\nI'll ask\nI don't think WGU even has my I.T\nsecurity track anymore did it for CCNA\nSEC because I didn't they did some\nrearranging to their to their curriculum\nas well to their tracks right so I know\nlike the cloud one now has an Azure and\nan AWS oneclock being switching from Venus sus\nName by the wayso it's slash self study plus projects\nplus networks yeah there you go perfect\nalso another thing that I feel like a\nlot of people are getting messed up on\nis and I blame Tech influencers\nincluding myself is that I feel like a\nlot of people are too quick to want to\ngo and build a brand but remember the\nBest Brands like self brands are the\nones that are made without the intention\nto make a brand so for example when I\nstarted YouTube I literally started\nmaking videos about stuff that I was\ndoing at work like if you look at my\nearlier videos they're all really Niche\nAzure functions type of things and\nbecause people could pick up like oh\nthis is just someone who's actually just\nsharing stuff that she's doing like I\nfelt like that helped now it's turned\nmore into like career advice and it's\nlike random Cloud stuff that I know\nand now I'm more so on a schedule of\nlike yeah I'd like to upload a video\nevery like once a week\num but if you go into making like your\npersonal brand with like oh I need to\nmake a personal brand it never works out\nwell make it like a byproduct right your\ngoal is not to build not to be a\npersonal brand expert your goal is to\nget into the field or the job you want\nto get to and the personal brand is just\nsomething on the side that works\num I I think I covered some of that inyeah it plus can kick rocks uh and and\nlike a video that I uploaded recently\nhow to build an online presence I did a\nvideo on that recently too\ncertain devs also require undergrad or\neven Masters is this for teachingrequires claims too if you go to\ngovernment oh oh uh government stuff\nyeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah\nuh Kathy told me about this like she got\nsecurity clearance and then all that\nkind of stuff and now like going from\nyou start off as a contractor always and\nthen\num you're always kind of like hoping to\nget that full-time kind of thing but\nlike you're always on like on the edge\nbecause you might get cut contractors\nget caught all the time\nso yeah very interesting interesting uh\ndynamic or environment to work in the\ngovernmentbig brain move is to go to college just\nto drop out to increase\nI'm just gonna go to college to drop out\nagain right\nlike And subscribe for the YouTube\nalgorithm thank you Lucy\nremember those five to seven people on\nshame yeah man but I also remember those\ndays and I'm like I didn't care about\nanything now I'm like so metric driven\nwhich I don't really enjoy\nwhich is why I've been making like a\nbunch of random Youtube videos that I\nknow are not going to do well but\nthey're just topics that I want to cover\num but there was time like last year\nwhere I was just so focused on like oh\nevery single video has to be a hit has\nto be a success\num but the fun is streams earlier those\nin from like all the streams that I've\ndone these are cool because now we're at\na place where like people just come and\nask questions I love but for a long time\nit wasn't like that\num but those early streams where I was\nplaying like video games remember I was\nplaying like I wasn't playing FIFA I was\nplaying like Tony Hawk and skater XL on\nstream those were the best\nit was like a venting session for mewhile I was in the army they skipped\npaying us for two weeks because folks\nwere grandstanding less space sector\nsince it's usually so gov dependent went\nback to CV Tech Center\nwhat is grandstanding love space Hector\nsince it's usually so gov dependentfascinatingI've been sharing your learner Cloud\nboot camp to people in Camp's Discord\nlately who want to get into space great\nappreciate you Mike\nreally appreciate it\numhold on\nthanks mine all right Ben shout out Ben\nthank you for liking\nlfcs re deaf retake from what I remember\nit had that waiver as part of their boot\ncamp I got so busy I let it expire\nI I think if I were to do a\ncertification it would either be one of\nthe sort of the Azure ones\nlike maybe 204 I feel like I get the 204\neasily\nlike part of me wants to get the 204\nwithout studying\nbut I'm scared because last time I did\nthat I did take the 900 without studying\nand I barely passed and that was with\ntwo years of experience\nwell I have just so much Azure developer\nexperience now that I feel like I can\ntake the 204 without studying and barely\npass which is I don't care to have the\nbest grade on a certification if I pass\nI pass that's all but if it would be the\ntwo it would be the 204 maybe the\nsolution Architects one\num or one of the Linux Foundation onesuh\nlet's see Gwen and rishab never\nconsidered cka setting for it now and it\nseems really beneficial in terms of road\nmap for saying for kubernetesafter my conversation with Kathy I\ndefinitely have more of like a sense of\nurgency to learn kubernetes because she\nwas like the one thing that I see and\nevery single customer engagement is\nkubernetes like I can't avoid that damn\nkubernetes logo so now I'm understanding\nlike okay if I want to move into a Cloud\nsolution architect role I definitely\nneed to know kubernetes well the ones\nthat I'm targeting like these roles are\ndifferent everywhere the ones that I'm\nsorry I definitely know kubernetes which\nfirst means I need to understand better\ncontainers in docker\nso maybe this sir would make more sense\nin that case\num so maybe after I'm done with like my\nbash and my Linux Focus I'll shift into\ncontainers andum container orchestration right\num so maybe like let's say January so\nMarch April May and June could be all\ncontainers and kubernetes stuff would be\ncool\ndefinitely\nGwen oh it's no worries I used to fun\nfact I used to abbreviate my name Gwen\nand then someone was like that's not how\nyou should abbreviate it should be Gwyn\nbecause your name is gwi and eth and I\nwas like all right sure\nI don't really care about that\ndo you have a video on your sysadmin\njourney currently looking to go versus\nAdmiral some I have a video of how I\nwent from help desk to success admin\ncheck it out\nuh I don't have anything specific I mean\nI guess that's a specific ass I can getdo you have a day in the life as a CL\nyeah I do I do have a couple daylight\nvideos on my channel I have like two or\nthree\nbut they're not like day in a life\naesthetic videos like oh here's the\nsuper fancy coffee machine at the\nMicrosoft Office I don't have I tried to\nmake them as realistic as possible\num\nespecially the one from like June I\nthink I did them in June oh my gosh that\nday was so long but I tried to make it\nrealistic so go check that out if you're\ninterested\nuh\nuh you're acting like I formatted them I\ncan't I can't have notes that I don't\nformat like okay let me show you my\nother notes hold on\nlet me show you\nuh share screen share screen\nboom all right these are my like these\nare my book notes so I'm currently\nreading this book the school of life and\nI just can't I need to have like I need\nto be able to like do bold stuff and\nlike add pictures and things like that\nso I could never use something that uh\nis probably too small\nI could never use something that\nwouldn't allow me to easily like notion\nis great the only thing I don't like\nabout notion has like no offline\noffline support but I need something\nthat I'd be able to do to be able to do\num\nformatting on uh where are my study\nnotes here's some study notes that I\nhave like Cloud native learning from\nlast year where to go hereuh here so oh I was starting to learn\ncontainers oh my goodness did I learn\nall did I do all this last year\nuh introduction to bash ah yes I\nremember this\nI did this live introduction to Docker I\nremember this\nuh so yeah anyway you get the idea of\nlike my my notes like I need to be able\nto format them pretty in like in a\nprogram that does it easily\nuh what else I feel like I did like\nintroduction to AKsI should have turned all of these into\nvideos and blog posts but I just did notthe thing is I have notes to to\nlater when I need to continue learninguh\nyou're at let's see yeahoh hold on where are we where where'd I\ngo here we go\njust pass the Linux Essentials on my way\nto the Azure shirt let's go Alex\ncongratulations the Linux essential is\nmy absolute favorite certification\nfavorite certification of all time I\ndon't have many certifications though so\nthat my opinion is very biased\ngrandstanding Congress is fighting and\nthings shut down budget wise and troops\nstop getting paid said nope no more good\njob for me ah\nI guess that's the flip side of the\nstability like maybe you're pretty safe\nfrom like recession type things but when\nthis type of stuff happens thenother schools are either way overpriced\nor a bit of scam what wsu's solid other\nthan the a plus cert and the degree plan\nCompTIA makes their way into everything\numit's pretty uh I don't know that's in\nresponse to somebody's practice exams\nhelp a lot monk mode monk mode baby oh\nit's because you probably see the left\nside monk mode I have a lot of stuff in\nthere I have like my career journal here\nlike I tell y'all like always keep\num\nuh sinks that you have with your manager\nI have like my Dev journal in here I\nhave some syncs with peers in here too\nuh and some advice that people have\ngiven me in here just write that stuff\ndown y'all write this stuff down because\nwhen people are going to ask you why do\nyou server I I 100 percent\nguarantee that if I ask one of you why\nthese are a promotion you're gonna give\nme some generic generic answer like oh\nbecause I do great work but no people\nwhen people ask you that you should be\nable to give detailed and informed\nresponses\nand you can't keep all that information\nin your brain because your brain is\nmeant to be processing it's meant to be\nRam it's not meant to be storage so\nwrite it down\nquick quick half an hour at the end of\neach week just type in what you did\nthrow it in anything you want to throw\nit into write it on\num\npaper journals like I use paper journals\na lot like I use this one is almost done\num\nlike right write stuff down like this\nthis one is yeah this one's pretty much\nalmost done like\nsome days it's just like a just like a\nline like this or sometimes it's going\nto be full paragraphs and Pages like\nthis like write stuff down do yourself a\nfavor written step down\num all right enough of my soapbox\nthing there toouh shout out to the old Cloud Expressway\nvideo I cried inside when I saw that\nAzure logo was different in vs code I\nlove things different back then okay but\nto be fair to help with that\nhold on\nlet's go to my GitHubI wish I could update that\numI mean I don't have an update a way to\nupdate that video or anything like that\nbut if you go to my resume challenge\nmy Azure resume azureAzure resume challengeAzure is it this one yeah I think this\nis one\nyou're gonna mine and if you go to back\nend you will have the code for d.net APS\nso the API button at six hold on let me\nremove this\nthere\nyou have it all I updated this 4.6 a\ncouple months ago and\nthe done it three is also in here too\nbut down at six is here too I don't have\na way to update the the old video or the\nblog post or anything like that but uh I\nhave it on mine made by GPS forward\nslash Azure Dash resume and you'll have\nthat working there\nI don't knowhow many visits do I have on my\nAzure resumeI checked the other day oh my goodness\ncome on I checked it the other day\num\nand it costs 12 a year to run my as a\nresume I have 10 000 10 000 views in\nmine fascinating\num\nyeah\nso for people who are worried about\nspending money to run projects like I\nthink twelve dollars a year or something\nmost people can affordit's 1am here always having times my bad\nmy bad I tried to do this one earlier I\ndid I started at five\nit's about to be two hours I gotta stop\nall right y'all thank you so much for\nhanging out I'm gonna be back sometime\nkeep your notifications on we almost hit\n100 we're at 84.\num really really appreciate y'all\nhanging out it was very therapeutic and\na very hectic day a lot of layoff nose a\nlot of like not knowing what the future\nof you know your career my career uh\nhappening so hopping on and having a\ncommunity to just hang out with answer\nquestions just chat really cool\num as always I'll try to be as\ntransparent as I can so if I do get laid\noff there's doubt you can bet your\nbottom dollar that I'm gonna have a\nclick baby video on my channel I just\ngot laid off for Microsoft if I do get\nlaid off but I didn't get laid off today\num I laugh because it's my way of\nhandling handling pain I guess\num\nbut thank you so much peace out everyone",
