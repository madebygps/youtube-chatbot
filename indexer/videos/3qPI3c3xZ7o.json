  "transcript": "I interviewed for the third time at\nMicrosoft in April of 2021 in May I\nreceived an offer and in June I joined\nfull-time I was hired as a level 61\nCloud developer Advocate I was based in\nConnecticut at the time and the role was\nand still is remote\nstarting base salary was around a\nhundred and forty thousand USD\nMay of 2022 I got a promotion to a level\n62. I'm currently now based in New York\nand with my promotion and my annual\nsalary increase that was awarded to me\nin September I am now around 175\n000 USD again base salary\nin my opinion reflecting on my promotion\nthere were definitely three key factors\nthat stand out to me the first one is\nbalancing ownership and partnership the\nsecond one is making it easier for my\nmanager and the third one is just\ndocumenting absolutely everything if\nthat is all you care about then see you\nlater if not hi I'm GPS I do Cloud\nthings at Microsoft and here on YouTube\ndon't forget to like And subscribe\nbecause it really does help out and\nwelcome to a new video let's first talk\na little bit about what a cloud\ndeveloper Advocate actually is and does\nadvocacy at Microsoft is all about\nbuilding Community around Microsoft\nTechnologies and related so for example\nwe didn't create or invent the\nprogramming language rust but we have\nAdvocate kits that are dedicated to\nbuilding support for rust on Microsoft\nand overall nurturing that Community\nsame goes for JavaScript python Cloud\nnative Linux\netc etc the way I like to divide the\nresponsibilities is sort of like into\npillars the first one being delivering\nand creating technical content courses\nspeaking at conferences meetups\nworkshops demos official documentation\netc etc and the second one being product\nwork and or feedback so perhaps you\ninteract with the customer and they've\ngiven you feedback then you can go back\nto the engineering teams and provide\nthat feedback to them or actually help\nthem Implement that feedback you can\nalso be actually working on Microsoft\nproducts Services\netc etc right depending on the role that\nyou're in the team and the level that\nyou're at the percentage of time that\nyou spent on both of these will be\ndifferent\nuh this role is still very very\ntechnical and I think I've gotten way\nmore experience with Azure in this role\nthan I did as a cloud engineer or as a\nCIS admin so if you're someone who likes\nto be Technical and likes to be public\nabout the things that you're working on\nadvocacy might actually be a great fit\nfor you so check it out\nnow let's talk a little bit about those\nthree key factors that I mentioned at\nthe beginning\nthe first one is balancing ownership and\npartnership one of the best things in my\nopinion about working in a large company\nis that there's going to be a subject\nmatter expert in anything that you could\nthink of so in my experience this has\nenabled me to focus on the areas and the\nskills that I really enjoy the most have\nthe most experience in as well and I\ndon't have to worry about becoming an\nexpert in multiple things and I can just\nbring my best to the table and\ncontribute to the success of others this\nis actually a really big part of\nMicrosoft culture and it's all about\nsort of teaming up on the right project\nwith the right people with the right\ngoals because that's going to be able to\nmake way more impact than I could ever\ndo on my own if I was doing my own thing\ndon't get me wrong there's plenty of\nspace for you to also just kind of like\nupskill in something new work on\nsomething new kind of do your own thing\nif you wanted to but really it's all\nabout that balance and it's working\nsmarter not harder and meeting new\ncolleagues in different teams different\nareas organizations along the way the\nsecond one is making it easier for my\nmanager so every week I have a meeting\nwith my manager where I really just get\nto talk about anything that I need that\nI'm stuck on or that I want and if\nyou've watched my how I organize my day\nvideo I'll have it linked somewhere here\nyou know that I really really value\norganization and systems so before these\nweekly meetings I would always spend\nabout 30 minutes a week sort of writing\ndown a list of things that I needed to\naddress in this conversation with my\nmanager so even though it only took me\n30 minutes a week to do this the impact\nhas been just amazing so this makes sure\nthat out of these conversations I always\ngot the most value possible I always got\nto dress anything that I need to get a\ndress and then all the work about\noutlining that conversation was put on\nme and that responsibility not on my\nmanager and then he can just focus on\nproviding whatever it is that I needed\nit also helps me communicate to him the\nwork that I was doing and any progress\nor really anything thing about my work\nso he was informed but it didn't have\nfelt like he had to put in the work to\nsee what I was doing which I think is\nvery important the third thing is\ndocument absolutely everything so at\nMicrosoft we have this tool called a\nconnect and we use it twice a year it's\nreally a way of us to showcase our\nimpact and our work concisely so\nquestions that you fill out are of the\nnature of like you know what were your\ngoals what work did you do and what\nimpact did that work have on those goals\nwhat would you have done differently\nwhat are you focused on the next couple\nof months Etc et cetera and the first\ntime I wrote a connect I was just\noverwhelmed because I could not remember\neverything that I did\nuh so since then I now keep a monthly\nJournal where I just read out the work\nthat I did so connect time comes around\nnow and I can fill it out with ease\ndefinitely leaning into metrics and data\nto further explain the impact\nand also like a really good thing about\nsort of partnering up and working on the\nright projects with the right people is\nbeing able to then ask for their\nperspectives and their feedback and\ntheir opinions on the work that I have\ndone coupling you know the connect the\ndata the metrics colleagues opinions and\nfeedback putting it all together really\nmakes for a better story on all the work\nthat I've done and it's a lot easier for\nmy manager and the leadership to come in\nand just intake all that information\nthat is that it is in the connect uh and\nyou know put me up for a promotion\nthat's pretty much it I'm going to\ncontinue putting these things into place\nbecause I'm trying to go for senior\nwhich would be the next level uh in 2023\nand when that does hop in I'll make sure\nto do another video and see what else I\ncan reflect on if you have any tips and\nadvice on getting promoted please leave\nthem in the comments that way we can all\nhelp each other out and that's it I will\nsee you in the next video",
