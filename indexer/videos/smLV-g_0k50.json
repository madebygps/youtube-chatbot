  "title": "Why and How I'm learning Linux",
  "transcript": "let me ask you a question that you might\nactually get at a technical interview\nuh not this specific question but maybe\nsomething along the lines of\ni have a file and it has multiple lines\nand each line has\nthis specific word that occurs multiple\ntimes\nhow would you go about replacing only\nthe second\nor the nth occurrence of the\nword second third fourth whatever it is\nif you asked me this a couple of months\nago i probably would have said something\nalong the lines of i would create a\nconsole application that would\nparse the content of the file and then\nmanipulate it that way\nbut now after discovering the power of\nthe command line\ni would say that i would use the stream\neditor command or the sed command\nor the sed command some the thing about\nlinux is everything has like multiple\npronunciations and they're all correct\nsomehow like butter fs or better file\nsystem or\nbetter fs yeah um i'll\nshow you how to use that command and to\naccomplish that task at the end of this\nvideo with that being said hi i'm gps\nand welcome to a new videolet me start with the why like most of\nus we learn things\nbecause it'll make us better at work or\nit's required for work or whatever work\nyou know let's just say work i knew when\ni started my role at acg\ni was going to be working on linux\nrelated projects and i simply didn't\nfeel comfortable enough\nwith my at that time skill set\nof linux to work on any of the projects\nso\nsat down with my manager and we flushed\nit out\nand i decided that i'm going to take a\ncertification within\na certain amount of time the first\nattempt at certification i actually\nfailed i made a video on that\num and then i took it a second time and\ni passed\ni always felt reluctant to learn linux\nbecause for some reason\nout of everything in tech it's that one\nspace where i feel like i definitely\ndon't belong\ni don't know why it is maybe it's\nbecause of my lack of experience or i\ndon't know the right tools or\nor i'm not sure what it is and now that\ni've actually\ndipped my toes in in the space i've\nrealized that it's a foolish mindset to\nhave um i'm quite\nintrigued and slightly in a healthy way\nobsessed\nwith uh the linux and and i actually\nhave\npopo s which is an ubuntu base\ndistribution\non my desktop and i've been using it as\nmy main operating system\nfor a couple of weeks now and i know\npeople are going to hop in the comments\nnow and say you should be using this\ndistro or you should be using that\ndistro\nhey i'm going to give a bunch of distros\na try just not right now i'm trying to\njust get comfortable right now\nbut yeah in this open source space and\nme\nhaving the mission to make you know\ntechnology and\ntechnical education more accessible and\nless daunting to everyone\nbecoming more familiar and learning\nabout things like linux and open source\nseems right up my alley\nso i'm glad i'm doing it now let me talk\nabout the how\ni have no shame in saying that when i'm\nlearning something new i need\na variety and lots of\nlearning material and that's videos\nthat's text\nthat could be like books or i don't know\nsome documentation\nand obviously hands-on disclaimer\nas most of you probably know by now i\nwork at a club guru\nso that means i have full access to our\nentire catalog and we have\nmultiple linux courses so that helped me\na lot\ni watched the linux essentials course\nand the lpi 101 which is\nsort of a step above it but what i like\nis that i can\ngrab some kind of lesson and if i\nneed like another type of explanation or\ni want to watch\na different explanation on it i can go\nto another course and see if it covers\nthat topic\nsometimes with certifications they have\noverlap\nand you know topics will be covered in\nboth of them but they might be explained\nin different ways or different contexts\nso i like that in terms of books i have\ntwo this one is the command\nline well the linux command line it's\nsort of like\nevery command well not every but the\nmajority of commands that you could\npossibly need to use is probably in this\nbook\nand what's great about it is it gives\nyou\nthe explanation and it gives you like\nmost popular arguments\nthat you could use and it also gives you\nkind of like a\nan exercise to do or like a playground\nexercise i think that's what they call\nit\nyeah so i just go in here so i'll watch\na lesson and then whatever command the\nlesson is on or whatever kind of task\nthe lesson is doing\ni'll hop into this book and i'll find it\nright and then i'll\ndo literally copy out the\nsamples and then just run through\nso by then i'll have like multiple\nexamples because i'll do the examples\nfrom the course\nthen i'll do the examples from this book\nand then i'll keep going\nanother book that i use is this one\ncalled\nlinux basics for hackers by no means do\ni want to become a hacker\nthough security is a very interesting\ntopic and also something that i'd like\nto explore but maybe next year\nbecause i'm just overwhelmed this year\nbut this is great because it teaches you\na lot of\ndifferent tasks but it gives you it\nteaches you those tasks in like\nthe context of a hacker\nso it's very hands-on like for example\nyou use\nthings like or you learn things like\nusing and abusing services and\ni know there's uh like chapter on bash\nscripting\nand uh one that i really really enjoyed\nthat\num i got a lot of benefit was this\ncontrolling file and directory\npermissions\npermissions was something that i had to\ngo over many many times like watch the\nvideos again\nread the linux command line book again\nand then read the security book again\nuntil it finally got in here i was able\nto get hands-on enough\nto really explore the commands that\nyou're expected to know for the linux\nessentials certification\nluckily the command line is something\nthat's pretty easy to get hands-on\nbecause it's not like hey you need a\nwebsite to play around with or to deploy\nin azure to\nplay around with some service you really\njust need a command and some kind of\ntask\nwhether that's editing or modifying\npermissions or\nyou know bash scripting or moving files\naround renaming all that kind of stuff\nright\ni just summarized what i learned i'd\nspend an hour in the morning just kind\nof going through the theory\nand watching the different material and\nthen i would let the day go like get my\nwork done\nand towards the end of the day i spent\nanother hour\ngetting hands-on and then writing the\nnotes so by no means\nam i a linux expert but i'm like\nfive percent ahead of where i was before\nand that's progress\nright next steps for me i'm studying for\nmy next cert\nwhich is the linux foundation certified\nsysadmin\nand here's when people are going to come\nin why aren't you studying for the red\nhat cert\nlook the red hat is great i simply don't\nneed the recognition\nthat the red hat cert gives you and i\nlike the fact that the linux foundation\none is distro agnostic\nplus they have a lot of overlap so if i\nstudy for one i probably just have to\nfill in the gaps\nand i'll be able to take the other one\nalongside that i'm doing a lot more\nhands-on things\nlike i deployed a ghost block to an\nubuntu server on azure\nthe next thing i want to do is deploy a\nnext cloud server\nalso probably an azure and azure because\ni'm most comfortable and i have a lot of\ncredits there\num yeah if you're not familiar with\nnexcloud it's an open source alternative\nto something like g suite or\noffice 3605 and like i mentioned at the\nbeginning this world of open source\nhas so many things going on um\ni'm also in the process of finding all\nthe tools that i use in my workflow and\nand finding open source alternatives\nfor them because it looks like open\nsource projects tend to respect\nprivacy a lot more right and i'm willing\nto\nsupport something like that even if i\nhave to pay for it\nbecause i think those things matter yeah\nso overall\ni feel a lot more comfortable in the\ncommand line and i think that's a win\nespecially in any kind of technical role\nit's just crucial to understand what's\ngoing on the command line yeah and\nthat's it for this video\ni do want to give a shout out to a\ncouple of friends of mine elf\nrichard and parveen they joined me on a\nstream last thursday and we just talked\nabout\nanything anything really um we all\nhappen to work in cloud related roles so\nit was kind of nice to just sit down and\ntalk to friends about\nyou know working in cloud i want to do\nthose more often\ni'm still trying to figure out what's\nthe best time i did put a poll in the\ncommunity tab\nso go check that out if you're\ninterested in that and i'd love to have\nlike a bunch of\ndifferent friends and and maybe even\nstrangers as long as you're respectful\nto hop on stream and then we can just\nchat yes\nand all right now this is the end of the\nvideo\ni will see in the next video but if you\nmade it this far i'm going to show you\nhow to use that command\nalrighty so let's display the file it's\na\ntext file and you see we have gwen gps\ngwen gps gps\ngoing gps gps gps alrighty so how can we\nonly replace the second occurrence of\ngps with gwyneth\non every single line well let's use the\nstream editor command\nso it'll be said and then s for\nsubstitute\nand then we'll first type in the word\nthat we're looking for gps then we're\ntyping in what we're going to replace it\nwith\nand then we're going to tell the command\nwhich occurrence we want to\nreplace so by putting 2 we're telling it\nhey we want to replace the second\noccurrence\nnow we tell it from what file just say\ntextfile.txt\nand i'm going to tell it to send\nthe replace text to a sample file\nsample.txt there we go so now if we take\na look at\nthe sample file you can see that we have\nvery similar output except\nthe second occurrence of gps has been\nreplaced with gwyneth you see here\ngps gps it's now gweneth first second\noccurrence here it's now going\nyou notice that that first one hasn't\nbeen replaced right but say now we\nwanted to replace the second occurrence\nin only the third line\nwell we could preface the s\ncommand the substitute command with a\nnumber to indicate that so we can say\nsomething like\nsaid three s\nand then the rest is pretty similar so\ngps\ngwyneth and then the second occurrence\nfrom the text file and let's create a\nsample.2oh i forgot theredirect there alrighty so now if i do\ncat\nsample two we'll see here that the first\nline\nis the same the second line is the same\nand then the third line the second\noccurrence of gps was replaced\nand that's a little crush course on the\nset command",
