this\nwhat upoh wait myall right just need to check sure your\nvolume is good good good good good good\nlet me close this close this what up\neveryone do my favorite hit a like on\nthat stream let's get some people to\njoin let's hang out let's work on some\nstuff let's answer some questions\noverall let's let's use let's make\nSaturday productive Let's uh let's get\nsome stuff done I have a project\num that I gotta build some\ninfrastructure as code files for but\nI want to try to use terraform\nbut the kicker here is I want to use I\ndon't know any terraform I'm like a\nMicrosoft purist\nI got no bicep I know.net Azure right\numbut\num\nI want to take the opportunity to to do\nsomething in terraform like the best way\nto actually learn something is Hands-On\nright\nso yeah\nBut be sure to ask me questions all that\nkind of stuff good stuff we'll see\nbut it's snap 30.\nwhatit's what does that mean\nBig JJ what up Jason how you doingnumerical\nhow you doing what's up everybodyforeign\nI feel like I got bit by a mosquito or\nsomethinghow's everyone doing todayoh nap timeall rightbe sure to ask me some questions while I\nuh\nfigure this stuff out okay so we could\nprobably switch the screen one second\nlet me\nuh or lower that downdo you work more with Cloud console or\nautomated I use the CLI pretty much for\neverything\npretty much for everything\num hold on so let's switch to I got this\nnew layout here so let's do this all\nright yes y'all can see that\nso this is WSL see I'm back on Windows\ntoday y'all I'm back on Windows today\nand like I know I keep getting comments\nlike oh my goodness did you switch to\nMac are you back on Windows oh now\nyou're back on Mac surprise you never\nknow what I'm gonna be using\nis gonna be a surprise okay\nall right so w sale\nI actually don't remember\nwhat I call thisReturn of the Mackuh I think it's this timestamper API\nI don't remember what I\ncalled it I think it's this\nuh\nokaydo a programming video it's been a whileI don't code anymore AI is going to\nreplace all that stuff I don't need to\ndo it anymore just kidding\nI caught a lot I just don't do videos on\nit because the real the reality is that\nthose videos don't do well and if you're\ntrying to build like an audience on\nYouTube\nthey don't do they don't do well magic\nwise but I code every single day like\nlook at my um hold on let me show you\nmy contribution graph on GitHub uh where\nis it\nlike I've been trying to be consistent\nevery single day build up that skill set\nyou knowum\nhold on I gotta find this\nso is everything good screen quality\ngood audio quality good video quality\ngood all that good stuff\nlet me know before I like start\nwell I want to show you my graph but\nit's not loading herethere we go\nall right look at that look at that\ngraph\nyou see it\nso for the last 20-ish days right there\nI've been pretty consistent I've been\npretty good\num\nI've been pretty good with uhwith with coding every single day right\nI could yeah I learned code every day\nit's like part of the job you know\nyou're you're so fast navigating the\nterminal I'm telling you I'm very\nefficient with the terminal\nI know how to move around quick I know\nhow where to get to I know how to filter\nall that kind of stuff I have a course\nbachelorbeginners AKA dot ms4 slash bash\nbeginners if you want to become\ncomfortable using command and stuff like\nthat too when it comes to Cloud when it\ncomes to anything like engineering\nrelated if you don't have terminal skill\nsets you're doing yourself a deserves\nall rightso we'll probably make this a little\nbigger here so anyway this is what I got\nhere but this code is this code is\ndisgusting this code is just filthy this\ncode is just not organized this code is\njust not it's not it's it's good code\nthis it's a lot of potential in this\ncode but there's just too much going on\nlike there's no dependency injection\num everything is literally living inside\nof hold on where is it\nuh\n[Music]\nuh why don't I see\nthe oh here oh my goodness everything\nliterally lives in this one file for the\nAPI is doing too much like we need we\nneed a layer in between those two\nso yeah\nbut anyway what this does is I'll show\nyou all in a second sosometimes you got to take your content\nwith where the money is\nyeah\nI don't know we'll see what we'll see\nwhat ends up happening\nhold on a second let me open this up\nhere\nhere open this up do me a favor y'all\nyeah hit that like uh button on the\nstream that way we can get some more\npeople hanging out\nasking questions all that good stuff\nall right cool\nwhat's your vs code settings what what\ndo you mean oh you know what I gotta do\nyou know what you know what I gotta\nenable for sure\nI gotta enable co-pilot let's reload\nthisthe co-pilot is just\nbeautiful love it love it I'm gonna use\nit to\nI'm going to use it to uh create my\ninfrastructure okay so what I'm going to\ndo here is create actually let's do it\nthis way\nuhdear infra\nuh and then justhold on\nI don't even know what's the what's the\nextension for terraformall right one second y'all let's do this\nwe're gonna go to\ndeploy and Azure function with terraform\nwe're going to start we're going to\nstart with that so I'm gonna use a mix\nof\nuh hold on\nso I'm going to use a mix ofuh chat GPT and go\nco-pilot toto\num\nhold on a secondto to teach me how to do this stuff\nall right\nBinghow to deploy an Azure Azure function to\nAzure with terraform\nI want so and I want to approach this\nhow I would any engineeringum\nfirst by like finding like documentation\nstuff and then once I have like very\nspecific questions I'll use tea you know\nwhat let's chat GPT login let's log in\nfirst\nso I play for GPT GPT plus whatever it's\ncalled cheap chat gbt Plus\numweren't you daily driving Mac OS I daily\nDrive everything see I told y'all\nsomeone was going to comment about it I\ntold you at the beginning of Stream So I\nwas going to comment I daily Drive\nanything I daily drive Linux I daily\nDrive windows I generally Drive\num Mac\nwe're gonna switch this to four\nokay cool\nso y'all will never know I'm just like a\nlittle surprise\nthe only bad thing that sucks about this\nis\ngbd4 currently has a cap of 25 messages\nevery three hours I feel like they\nchange that though I feel like yesterday\nwas like this was set to four hours\nbut yeah\num so the Mac is just terrible for\nstreaming that's just the reality like I\nwould need to do I would need to have a\nsetup where my Mac is being like it's\nsending its output to another computer\nfor it to stream so like offload the\nvideo uh the like the live streaming of\nthe video to another machine and that's\njust like too much work\nthat is too much work Okay so\nalso I think I have a\na button here I don't know there's like\na button that so I can like curse but it\nlike covers it like bleeps it let me see\none second\nlet's see I know I had it not that I\ncurse a lot butis that bleeping out the words people\ntell me\nokay cool anyway so gpt4 let's ask how\ncan I deploy an Azure function to azure\non a Linux consumption plan with\nterraform\nlet's see what it says here oh I should\nI should have put\nI should have put that it's dot net\nbecause this is that's probably going to\nbe\nthere's gonna be a problem\nconfigure Azure CLI\nmake sure you have terraform install\ntheir machine created terraform\nconfiguration so I know I know bicep so\nI'm gonna try to leverage my bicep skill\nsets\nit's like whenever I tell you all the\nassociation the the association\nuh pattern that I use I did a video on\nthis like two three videos ago\nAssociation pattern so whenever I\nlearned something new in cloud or in\nTech in general I never learn it from\nscratch\num and I think the more you learn Cloud\nthe less you're gonna have to learn\nstuff from scratch so right now the\nassociation pattern is I know Cloud I\nknow bicep I know Azure functions I know\nwhat I fully deployed function has to\nlook like when it's in Azure so the\nmissing part is terraform so okay using\nall that how do I grab terraform and\nlike implement it right\nlook at this y'all\nhold on did it finishall right so while it keeps finishing it\nsays in solid terraform make sure you\nhave terraform installing machine you\ncould download the let's go hereuh Linux\ncan I just copy all of this\nlovely open this up clear\nCDs nah CDs Claire\nand I wonder if it'll do it all\nin one shot\nvoice changer is sending methis guy let me get up and hop back on\nthis Docker upskilling project flavor of\nthe day\ntoday I'm just feeling like Windows\ny'all I'm just feeling like using\nWindows today maybe that's it right I\nwish I could play music but then this\nstream will not be monetized and that\nkind of sucks in terms of like a\nlongevity standpoint also\num\nI just feel like the music that I listen\nto when I'm working is really weird and\nit's probably going to be a little\noff-putting to some people because it's\nkind of just like very\nuh very like not monotone but there's\nnot like lyrics or stuff like that uh I\nlike a lot of like Daft Punk's Daft Punk\nstuff\nyeah so we'll let this go\nwhat's your vs code settings my vs code\ntheme is deep material deep dark uh I\nlove this this is literally I never\nchange it unless deep dark material\ntheme unless I'm doing hold on let me do\na zoom right here here you go deep dark\nmaterial theme you can see that yeah\num\nI never change it unless I'm doing some\nkind of demo and for accessibility\npurposes I need to do\na white like a wider or lighter theme\nthen I'll do something else okay\nwhat is up with this\nwhy is this taking so long oh\noh you said ask for my password No it\ndidn'tI think that's my passwordI don't actually remember all my WSL\npassword is\nbut yeah while we wait for this to\ninstall how's everyone doingterraform Dash version or is it Dash\nDash\nnice okay\nwhat up everybody should show her she's\nso harsh that coding do nothing it's my\nown coat so I could be very umvery harsh about it okay cool so we got\nterraform\nso it told us\nuh make sure you have terraform assault\non your machine you can download the\nlatest version blah blah configure Azure\nCLI ensure you have the Azure CLI\ninstalled in your machine\noh yeah I have that and that you are\nsigned into your Azure account by\nrunning I'm pretty sure I'm I'm pretty\nsure\neasy account show Dash Dash\nquery\nI think it's just name\nOkay cool so I'm set to the right one\nthere what else I gotta do\nuh create a terraform configuration file\ncreate a new directory for your\nterraform configuration files and\nnavigate to it create a new file name\nmain.tf all right that's it that's first\nstep right there\nlet's go into here uh\nwhere are we here\nuh CD infra and then we'll do\nuh Tut no code main.tfhere we goextension has search Marketplace let's\nsee what extensions they have yeplet's let's do this\ndo me a favor if you just if you just\ngot here here like uh we only have we\nhave 17 likes we got 22 people watching\nhit a like on that stream\nalso just to preface everything I I have\nnever used terraform ever so this like\nI'm gonna make a lot of mistakes but I\nwant to embrace\nthat and show more of it so okay so we\ngot thiswe'll close this here we'll close this\nhere okay cool so where is it here\noh my goodness here we go\nhere is a sample terraform configuration\nto deploy an Azure function on a Linux\nconsumption plan provider Azure IM\nfeature should I just copy it and then\nwe'll just look through it as we go and\nVia his code\nso I'm I'm okay so bicep looks very\nsimilar to this which is great\nah hold on okay so I need to I need to\nchange this so what I need to do is\nokay hold on\ncan I write this here uh how can I\ndeploy an Azure function on Lexus\ncountry plan no and Azure eight so we\ncan put here dot net oh come on dot net\nseven\nout of process Azure function let's be\nmore will be more specific there okaydeploy a DOT Net 7 out of pro because\nfor for functions you have in process\nand isolated when it comes to.net out of\nprocess or isolated are the ones like\nthat should be the default one that\nyou're using anyway\nso okay we got everything I think I got\nI think I'm on done at seven yeah I\ngotta be\nyeah and then this project is done at\nseven two I'm pretty sureyeah cool\nback\nall right\nso\nokayuh Creator publisher\nokay here we go\ncreate a terraform configuration file so\nwe're back hereand I'm probably gonna copy paste and\nbut edit it before we actually run it\nbecause\nas bad is is bad practice to just copy\ncode that uh GPT generates for you\nlook at me I'm gonna be a devops\nengineer in no timeit's so crazy where this technology is\nat like\npeople who are like I was I was speaking\nabout this earlier but you know like\nyesterday but people who are on the\nextreme of like oh we have nothing to\nworry about\nand the uh or with like AI will never\nreplace us and then we have the Other\nExtreme where it's like we're all doomed\nthere's no hope for us AI is going to\nreplace us are missing the immediate\nopportunity where I who have like I\nsomeone who has never ever used\nterraform before can pretty much use an\nassociation pattern which is what I'm\ndoing now it's like okay I know where I\nneed to get I kind of have an idea how\nto get there I just don't know how to\nuse this specific tool but I can go ask\nspecific questions to this thing and it\ncan guide me alongthis is probably not right\nalso this is this doesn't seem like it's\ndone it like stopped it's like stopped\ngenerating\nbut for now we can copy copy this code\nhereso we're gonna.net ice I know so I know\nfor a fact this needs to be done and\nisolated\njust I know that because I've deployed\nthis so many times with umwith other tools I feel like when\nsilence changing into being productive\non my Saturday also let's switch my\ncamera over here\noh come on\ncome onoh wait wait wait wait wait I'm looking\nat the wrong one I'll do this one\nno sorry sorry I keep\nI keep uh\noh no I didn't include the chat in this\none one second y'allsorry I keep moving itsorry I'm the worst\nokay there's chat we'll put the chat\nover here because it's a little easier\nto see\nokay cool\nalrighty so let's look through this\nlet's look through this\nlet's look through what it generated us\nokay provider Azure RM I know a\nterraform uses providers\nas in like that's where it gets gonna\nget deployed\nrightI don't want to use up my tokens for\ngpt4 so let's go to Bing\nlet's go to Bing chat\nit's only available in Edge come onuh bing.com that's crazy all right what\nis a provider in Terror form\nokay\nno chat chat chat me up what is a\nprovider and tear okay you're you're\ngonna respond to meuh\nuh in terraform a provider is a plug-in\nthat allows users to manage an external\nAPI okay it acts as a translation layer\nthat allows terraform to communicate\nwith many different Cloud providers\ndatabases and services all right so it's\nlike sinceriform is cloud agnostic you\ngot to kind of tell it what to work what\nto work with right cool cool\nuh Hey Gwen hello GPS hi everyone\nwelcome so cool so I guess if we're\nreason something else we'd use the AWS\nthere so it makes sure it makes sense to\nuse azure\nuh also people do me a favor if you ever\nhear like some crackling in the audio or\nlike the video starts freezing just let\nme know in the chat all right I'm using\nlike a new setup so I need to make sure\neverything's smooth and crispy for y'all\nokay so we're gonna leave Edge open in\nthe background\nso that makes sense resource uh Azure RM\nunderscore Resource Group okay so this\nis\nexample\nresource\nuh resource okay so okay okay\nso we're creating a resource of type\nAzure RM Resource Group and I'm assuming\nthis is the name but we're going to call\nthis uh\ntimestamper API Dash resource actually\nno hold on\nusually and I'm sure this needs to be\nabstracted into some kind of variable or\nper parameters or something like that\nbut for right now we're just gonna leave\nhere uh the my preference is to always\ndo RG Dash so For Recess groups some\npeople do RG at the end but I do RG at\nthe beginning because that's just what\nworks for me okay\nand I don't want West Europe as my\nlocation I want east east\nus2 name hold on no\nexample name what's the difference\nbetween this\nand this or are these the same this here\nokay okay okay okay hold on no I get it\nI get it now\nI get it\nthis name is the name within the\nterraform file right the referencing yes\nso if I need to reference it in the rest\nof the file that's the name this name is\nactually what is going to be set as the\nname in Azure all right so this needs to\nbe RG so in this case and I can probably\njust call this\nResource Group name or maybe just a\nresource Group\nthat's fine okay cool\nnow what we're creating is a storage\naccount I'm going to set this we should\nhave like I know in this best practices\nto kind of like a prefix and like a\nrandom generated ID but we'll get to\nthat maybe in another stream or\nsomething like thatuh I have a question if you don't mind\nask if you don't mind me asking do you\nthink anime and gaming are just a waste\nof time while learning clouds or just in\ngeneral\nlovely question thank you for asking no\nI just finished playing this video game\ncalled breath of the Wild\nand I loved it it was such a level game\nsuch a lovely experience but most\nimportantly it is so crucial and\nimportant to have hobbies outside of\nyour career that you can spend doing a\nlittle bit every day or whenever you\njust need a break whenever you just need\na breather now the key here is\nmoderation of course if you're doing it\ntoo much it's consuming your life or\nwhatever it is or you feel like you're\nyou're not doing the things that matter\nto progress your career then you me you\nmay need to re like reconsider what\nyou're spending your time but you don't\nwant to you don't want to be at either\nextremes like waste too much time doing\nlike things that are not productive and\nthen having absolutely no life or no\npersonality out outside of your career\nbecause those two like extremes are not\ngood\nbut having a balance like you know\nsometimes I play like maybe 30 minutes a\nday sometimes I ended up playing like\nthree hours a day right but as long as\nit's not every single day is completely\nfine okay\nI would I would recommend having\nactivities that you can stimulate\num different parts of like\nnot just like uh like uh like so a video\ngame can stimulate you I guess mentally\nand and like it's exciting it can be\nsomewhat creative because you can\nessentially put yourself in a different\nworld right but also have hobbies that\nmaybe are like like a different type of\nuh like physical like if there's a sport\nyou like or you like going to the gym\nlike personally I've been like walking\nand running a lot more\num trying to get healthy that's the goal\nfor the summer y'all let's all get\nhealthy\num other other types of hobbies include\nmaybe like learning an instrument like I\ngot my guitar back here\num and every morning I've been trying to\nspend like 25 minutes just practicing\nagain I used to play guitar as a kid and\nthen I stopped playing because I I\nneeded to focus on my career but now\nit's brought me so much joy to kind of\njust have it next to me whenever I need\na break to do that so different types of\nhobbies spend different amounts of time\ndepending on like what your schedule\nworks like but yeah it's important to\nhave things outside of work because you\nknow you're a human being you need to\nhave a personality and that type of\nstuff right\nall right cool\nuh another one let's do one more before\nI dive into this again have you ever\nfelt like you were thrown into the deep\nend of the pool how did you learn from\nthis and how do you feel about your\nperformance during this time yeah all\nthe time\nthe the last like significant time that\nI felt like that was when I was\nbeginning The Bash beginning The Bash\nfor beginners course that I released a\nmonth ago I was and that feeling had\nhappened in November of last year\nbecause that's when essentially the\nwhole process started and I was like I\nhave I really have no idea how I'm gonna\nput this all together like I because\nbecause essentially when you're working\nlike a bit well maybe I'm not going to\ngeneralize it but when you work at\nMicrosoft you have the ability to work\nwith whoever you want and however you\nwant but you really have to come up with\na plan from scratch and you have to go\nand recruit the team you have to go and\nsay like we want we could do this we\ncould accomplish this this is why this\nis worth investing time in\num\nso you know me having only like a year\nor so of experience there I was kind of\nintimidated but I I draw out a plan and\nthen I just went and I executed it\nI learned so first of all I met like a\nbunch of new people which is awesome I\nlearned that it's like kind of like\nShark Tank like every time you got a\npicture project and and you learn how to\ncreate like great one-pagers you learn\nhow to like collaborate and stuff like\nthat and that was fantastic\num but I the the biggest thing is like\nwhenever you have that feeling lean into\nit like trust your gut it's like so\nintimidating especially at the beginning\nwhen you don't when you feel like you\nhave no idea how you're gonna accomplish\nit but in a couple of months or a couple\nof days or a couple weeks or however\nlong it takes you you're gonna be able\nto look back and like and like be like\nman I figured that out and the trust\nwith your own with yourself and your own\nskill set is only going to increase all\nright cool\nuh no question I love questions that's\nthe point of this like we're kind of\nworking on something but we're also\nanswering questions and stuff like that\ntoo okay so next we have here I'm just\ngonna call this first of all storage\naccount\nstorage account because we already know\nthis is a reference name right Azure RM\nsearch account name we're going to call\nthis\ntimestamper API store that might be a\nlittle too long Resource Group name uh\nthis is not example anymore this is\nResource Group oops\nResource Group\ndot name\nand then location would be Resource\nGroup\nuh location oh no this is wrong hold on\nwait Resource Group name restrict\nlocation ECS okay cool account to your\nstandard lrs perfectresource uh Azure RM app service plan\nokay we'll call this app service plan\nand we're going to call this timestamper\nStamper APIplan there I don't know if hyphens are\nallowed in plan names so we'll just\nleave it like that for now\nthe location would be\nresearch group\nDash no come on\nResource Group Resource Group name which\nis Group location kind function app\nuh Reserve true okay so also skus so\nagain remember I mentioned it's going to\nbe easier for me\nit's going to be easier for me to\nto learn something like terraform given\nthat I already have the context of what\nlike what a deployed function looks like\nhow to deploy a function to Azure using\nother Technologies like bicep right so\nin this case it's telling us okay what\nSKU do we need here\nwell I know it has to be dynamic and of\ntype y1 because in bicep you also have\nto Define it this way as well right so\nboom cool\nthis is lovely like GPT generated all of\nthis now it's gonna work that's another\nquestion but we're walking through this\nstep by step okay\nokay resource the actual function app\nand we're going to call this function\napp and then we're going to call this\ntime Stamper API app\nokay there we go\nlocation needs to be resourced\ngroup Dash location we're just going to\nreplace This research group name\nResource Group name app service plan ID\nwhich would be app service we could\nactually we're just going to call this\nplan\nshorter there\nplan Source account name is going to be\nstorage account dot name\nuh\nwhat up nards right now we are creating\ninfrastructure as code files\nfor this so okay you know what let me\ntake a second here to show y'all what\nI'm gonna end up deploying\nme oh come on\nmade by GPSslash time Stamper API\nokay so oh I have a pull request and an\nissue\nokay cool I gotta take a look at that in\na second so\nuh I don't know if y'all I shared this\non my Community page but what we're\ndoing is I have this this application\nhere that will I provided a YouTube URL\nand it provides me time stamps you can\nsee on the left side here it has like\ntime stamps and like a little summary of\nwhat happens during that time\nbut it's just code the code's kind of\nmessy and ideally when you're creating a\ncloud project you want to include CI CD\nyou want include a restrictions code you\nwant to test it if possible you want to\ncreate like some documentation so the\ncode and people in the ways people can\nuse it locally is here but there's more\nstuff I can add now I thought there\nwould be a fantastic opportunity for me\nto learn something new like terraform\nand leverage my existing skill set with\nbicep and I actually be like okay how do\nI use styrofoam to deploy this and then\nI'll have a project using terraform boom\nokay but I'm not learning from scratch\nAssociation pattern my friends Okay cool\nso that's what I'm doing okay if\nanyone's interested in checking out this\nAPI I'll send it here\nuh all right cool go back here and we're\nback in here okay so let's look at the\nactual function app resource\nuh awesome also thanks I was able to get\na devops offer two months ago coming\nfrom software engineer background\nbecause of your videos that is so\nawesome I am so proud of you thank you\nfor letting me know that\num I'm always super happy to hear when\npeople land the jobs that they want uh\nmake the moves that they want to make\num so I trust I try so hard to like keep\ncreating and keep making this stuff free\nbecause you never know who it's gonna\nhelp so that's awesome\nreally proud of you I hope you\nI hope you celebrated yourself\num you know\nhowever it is that you do that\num and yeah like welcome to the lovely\nworld of of devops and Cloudall right let's keep going\nlocation app service plan search account\nsearch account access key\nstorage account access key where the\nheck is that\nstorage account\nlike that not primary access key where\nis it getting this is this like a secret\nthing waitAuthority cam maybe it's able to\nretrieve it\nas like a return like an output we'll\nsee\nokay cool\nuh site config isolated.net isolated\nlovely Azure beam example\nslot staging\nokay as location\nthis I know I'm gonna have to I know I'm\ngonna have to change but I'm I'm gonna\nhave to like find a tutorial on this\nthough but we'll see location Azure\nResource Group Dash\nResource Group\nthe location Resource Group dot name\nfunction app is\nfunction app dot name\nplan Dotplan dot ID\nstorage account is storage account dot\nname perfect\nis storage account dot primary access\nkey lovely okay cool\nuh all right so now what\nit says there's an error somewherewhat is the error herethere is no clue where where\ntwo three four\nuh\noh here here there there we go lovely\nlovely all right so what does it say we\ndo now\nwhere's chat GPToh wait no it did\nso I config\noh there's more on this hold on no wait\nno there's not more in this\nso I can figure resource\n[Music]this is a slotplan okay hold onit's good\nso how do I deploy thislet's do terraform Dash helpit says prepare your working directory\nfor other commands well check where the\nconfiguration is valid all right let's\ndo that right tarot form terraform\nvalidate oh no no it's not validate it's\nyeah\nthe configuration requires provider\nregistry but that product is available\nyou may be able to install automatic\nterraforming all right terraform init\nterraforming it y'allterraform has successfully been\ninitialized okay\nterraform validate does it work now no\nsomething's up\noh hold on okay\nit says here\nreference to Undeclared resourceAzure I am Dash underscore app\nunderscore service plan has has been\nsuperseded by Azure RM service plan\nokay but also I have an error here that\nsayswhat does it say reference to Undeclared\nresource on line 48 it's probably like\nsome naming thing that I did wrongforty forty forty forty forty eight uh\nso this should be plan\ndepends on plan that's good\nbut this is saying that we need to\nreplace this with just\nlike that\nbecause there's a new version all right\nlet's try it again\nterraform validate\nno there's lots there's so much wrong\nnow\nthe the\nthe on May 19\nthe OS type is required can I just say\nLinuxcan I just say Linux uhkind function appLynn wait hold on yes okay\ncopilot man co-pilot knows what to do\nall right let's do telephone valid again\nall right it looks like we got less\nerrors which is good\nskew name is required but the excuse\nright hereblocks of the type skew are not expected\nhere okay\nhold on let's see let's see let's see\nlet's see let's see\nQ name\niswhat is the skew name\noh maybe like\ndynamic\nis this it Dynamic y1 yes oh my goodness\nplease be that\nall right Claireuh okay okay with Azure RM service plan\non 23\nline 23 here\ncan't cut okay so I guess this is not it\nI feel like I don't know I feel like\nwe're making too many changes now\nvalue for unconfigure I shouldn't plan\nso you know what before we make so many\nchanges what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\ngo into good oldterraformokay\ngive me an exampleabstract plan OS type skew name\nokay cool\nnow let's go back here so that means we\ndon't need\nwe don't need thisall right let's try that nowuh excuse namebiwa oh okay so it's not Dynamic it's\njust y1now we have an issue inline 31 app service plan is this here we\njust need to rename that and then a 45\nuh we need to rename this to and then\nlet's do it nowcheap PT okay so you know how everyone's\nlike GPT is going to replace all of us\nit's giving very buggy code which is\ngreat because it's a great startup point\nright but you can see how all this stuff\nis so outdated so there's many changes\nthat we have to do\nokaythe Azure RM function episode has been\nsuited by Azure okay okay so this is\nwhat we got\nit here\nand we got to replace this and let me\nsee if I can find an example of this\nand then our jobs are safe for now\npeopleAzure\nhere we gosearch a cow service plan\nbut you know what you can feed it\nyou can feed it documentation and then\nit can give you an answer which I think\nis cool\nAzure RM Linux function app example we\ncan copy this here\nAzure arm service plan\nall right so let's go here let's go back\nhereand let's justuh\nI guess I could just\nremove this boomall right\nremove thatand have our Resource Group name\nResource Group\nlocation Source account name is storage\nname storage\nthere we go service plan is planned\nplan\ndot ID\nI don't know if we need this version\nlet's seelet's validate once moreokay version is not expected here\nand then I gotta go toreference to Undeclared resourceshow much scripting should a freshly know\nto launch a career in devops or sysadmin\nyou need to know you need to be able to\ndo all the things that you can do\nin the console\nin the console if you haven't noticed I\nhave not once touched\nI have not once touched a UI or anything\nlike that you need to be able to learn\nlearn something like bash or something\nlike Powershell and take it a step\nfurther and Learn Python okay\nuh but hold on let me see\nversion line 53 line 53 line 53 what's\nwrong here Oh No 53 okay Azure oh\nthere's no app here that's why\nuh function app\n[Music]\n53 here\nI think it's just\nall rightuh Linux effect version with Azure Ram\nfunction app in the resource\nLinux effects version here\nsite config\nall right says it doesn't need itline 48\nfunction app name is uh what is it now\nAzure RM Linux\nLinux function lit Nix okay cool\nlet's go return from validate\ninsufficient site config blocksat least one second food blocks are\nrequired\nokay hold on let's go back to the\ndocumentation and see what it says here\nokay it asks this here\nlet's go\nto site config for\ndo I need this I don't know if I'll need\nthis but we'll take a look in a second\napp settings I think it's here\nboomclear\nvalidateoh there's another one the Azure RM\nfunction app slot resources bins okay so\nwe gotta we gotta replace this toookay so we'll go down here see I had to\nupdate all this GPT code\nso our jobs are safe for now people\nthat's the good news\nthere's probably gonna be a lot here\nthat I gotta fix tooon line 46function app ID is required okay\nlocation function app name\nfunction app name function app ID is\nit's probably I don't know I'm just\ngonna take a guess here\nfunctionab Dot dot ID I'm gonna it's\nprobably gonna be something like that\nright there coolglaretelephone validate we have online 48it says in Azure shuffling example\nlocation is Groove\nlocation is not expected here really\nyou don't need to know the location all\nright fineall right last one says 49 Resource\nGroup\nit doesn't need to know the research\ngroup either all right fine how do you\nknow what are you just using the plan\nhow do you know where touh okay 48function app name is not and then it\nalso says ID okay so what is it what\ndoes it need\nis it just using the plan\nokay it's also not accepted no there's\nall right so this is not right we're\ngonna go back to the terraform\ndocumentation\nand look it up hereyep agreed with the answer perhaps\nansible should have some validation too\nyeah all right cool so Azure Azure of\nservice plan function app slot literally\njust needs to name function app and\nfunction app ID and storage account name\nname function app ID and storage account\nname cool\nname\nfunction app ID\nthis function app name Now function\nfunction app ID equals like there we go\nperfect oh man you gotta love get GitHub\nCopilot\nI need to configure this alone\nformat document lovely\nand what did it say okay it doesn't need\nthe storage account name\nhow how is your Mac experience anybody\nthat's from Unix native system I'm back\non Windows I was literally telling\npeople at the beginning like I one day\non Windows one day I'm back one day I'm\nLinux like\nit's like I roll a dice in the morning\nwhatever lands on that's what I do\nterraform validateuh\nline the slot example can't configure\nvalue for\nso I don't\n52 all right so I guess it doesn't need\nthis here\nI don't know I feel like this is not\ngonna work but we'll see\noh my goodness y'all\nlook at thisso how do we deploy this terraform help\nwe'll see can I do just Dash h\na terraform laga provider refresh show\ntest unique workspace\nuh\nuh plan plan show changes required by\nthe current configuration okay\nCreator update infrastructure knit\nvalidate okay so next one is to do\nterraform plan\nand we'll see what it doesI guess this is going to take a while\nso while that happens oh no let me open\nuh\nwhat we're gonna do is do AZ group AZ\ngroup list and we'll do an output table\nand we'll see what groups I have just to\nmake sure I do have a Time Stamper group\nbut I don't have a time Stamper what am\nI calling it here I want to make sure\nokay we're going to call it timestamper\nAPI okay\nsoit should deploy timestamper API if it's\ncorrect\nokay\nlet's take a look here\nso it says terraform will perform the\nfollowing actions terraform function app\nwill be created\nresource\nknown after known after no no blah blah\nblah\nAzure function Linux function app slot\nexample will be created lovelysite config\nall right Azure RM research group will\nbe created\nall right okay cool let's just do it f\nit\nuh eight wait what was it what was the\nterraform Dash help what was the thing\nto deploy apply\nterraform apply\nterraform apply wait how does it know my\nsubscription how does it know where to\napply it to how does it know where to\ndeploy I don't think I ever set that up\nunless it uses the context of the Azure\nCLI which would be nice\nlet's see what happens thoughdo you want to perform these actions\nterraform will perform these action\ndescribed okay so okay so does a does\napply does apply run plan as well that's\ncool if it does do the desk cooluh should take from EnV that's awesome\nthat's cool\nthat's cool that's cool so let I know\nall right okay stops getting created\ny'all let's take a lookthere we go\nnow if it's gonna create successfully I\ndon't know but we'll take a look here\nlet's do easy AZ uh easy function\napp listwhatdo thatwe have some but we don't haveoh hold on\nDash query dash dash query because I\ncan't see this name\nmaybe it might need to be uppercase\nthere\nname like this\nI don't know\noh my goodness I hate when this happens\nall right so let's do this firstis it lowercase n n a m n a m ewait no it was hereI just need the name of each function\napp deploy that's it why are you not\nquerying for mewhere is itwhy does it say that blowfish\nthat's funny\nuhokay\nwe'll just do we'll just do this we'll\njust we'll just output it to the table\nfor now I guess fineokay look at that we got now a function\napp under the Reese the res the RG\ntimestamper API that's cool that's good\nlet's see\nit completed all right so let's go to\nAzure nowwhat do you think about security jobs as\nyour future career as my future career\nor whose future career\nwho like what do you what do you mean\ntimestamp API\nI'm gonna open these two because I I\nknow I have them deployed\noh wait no\nyes sweet sweet credits okay so this is\nthe one I deployed manually like a while\nago\nand this is the one I deployed just nowokay so right away what looks different\nAh signalr that's fine because I didn't\nDefine that entire form so let's open\nboth functions and let's see what's\ndifferent\nyours your future career I don't have\nany interest in security that's just me\nthough I'm not saying there's anything\nwrong with it it's just not something\nI'm interested in wait no I opened the\nwrong onethis needs to be this year they have\nsuch similar icons\nokay Linux Linux app service plan y1 y1\nokay so far so good\nactually you know what let's do this\nno like that I'll put this one hereuh\nfour one six six okay so like the real\nkey the real kicker\nthe real kick is going to be in\nconfiguration\nconfiguration\nso\nthis\nfunction extensions version needs to be\nfour\nfour nice work at run time worker run\ntime work it run time nice\nlovely weren't open a I key okay cool\nwe got it we got our infrastructures\ncode\nbut to be fair we're still missing\nwe're still missing signal R soum\nwait where'd it go\nso we're still missing a\noh waittime super API\nso we have a storage Account app Service\nPlan app service slot and function app\napp service plans storage account\nfunction app there's no slot in here so\nmaybe I didn't need in the first place\nI'm not really using key Vault but I\nneed signal R oh I need a static web app\nfor my front end okay and then app\ninsights for monitoring lovely but it's\nget it's working out it's working out\nwell y'all this is cool this is cool so\nwhat I'm going to do right now is just\ndo a little a little clear this up here\nand then I'm gonna do a git add\nand then I'm gonna do a git commit\nand I'm gonna say\ncreated\ninfra files okay then I'm gonna do a\nlittle get pushy\nget push get get push lovely\nand then I'm gonna go to my I'm going to\nclose Bing I'll need you BingI'm gonna go to my GitHub\nscroll upokay we're gonna go my GitHub\nand wait what happened did it not work\noh I forgot to do a get pull no wait no\nwhat happenedoh hold onokay I need a I need to get ignore I\nneed to add\nso okay one secondI need to add in the git ignore to\nignore the proper files from terraform\nso obviously I only need main TF right\num\nsomeone said terraform destroy okay\nwe'll do terraform destroy because\nthat'll take that'll take down the\ninfrastructure rightwait no hold on that was not right CD\ninfra\nterraform destroy here\nbut I also need I need to get ignore\nwhat do I need to add to get ignore for\nterraform\nlet's ask chat gbtuh what what\ndo I need to add to my git ignore it it\nget get ignore file when I'm using\nterraform terraform okay\ntell me the truth when you when using\nterraform you should have certain file\nthe director should get in our file to\nkeep up blah blah\nokay so the entire terraform fileTF state\ntfvars\nso I'm assuming at some point I have to\nto abstract like the parameters and the\nvariables two different file right I\nthink it's like a params filehold on one second y'allokay\nso\nso okay\nI'm gonna copy thisand we're gonna go in here and we're\ngonna go to my ignoreuh the other stock is starting to turn\nfrom say okay hold on Telephone will\ndestroy all your management structures\nshown before yes let's do that\nand let's do that and let's add it to\nthe bottom\nhonestly it's probably better examples\nof what I added terraform but for now\nI'm not going to paste all I mean I\npaste all of it in but where where to go\nI just added this they're from directory\nno dash\nthey should do it because this is like\nliterally any file without terraform\ninfra\nuh but we could probably do like infra\ndot terraform okay\nState file surfarm\nprobably need to do thisinfra this because it's inside of this\nfile folder crash log\nagain inside of here and\nthe solution says anywhere but\nI don't want you to be from anywhereignore override as far as they can taste\nsensitive information\n[Music]uh\nterraforms ignores CLI configuration\nfiles okay this thisoh no there's a terraform State here why\nthat's not\nI'm just going to manually delete this\nwell once it finishes because I think\nthat's because I ran it's because I ran\nthe the command at the wrong directory\nat the wrong pointsomeone said how to get into Cloud\nwithout a degree\ndoing this stuff go online and teach\nyourself all this stuff\nthat's how you do it but to be fair like\nthe other day\nso when asking this question and the\nreality is like the importance of your\ndegree matters more so on where you live\nthan the field right because like I have\nthe privilege of living in the U.S\nbut in the U.S the the\nbias or the requirement of having a\ndegree is a is a lot more lenient than\nperhaps other countries\nso if I give you the advice of like oh\nyou can do this on a degree don't go to\nschool then I'm not taking into\nconsideration where you live and all\nthat kind of stuff right so for example\nI used to live in Ecuador and like you\ncouldn't get a cashier job there without\na degree I don't know how it is now so\nthat's why I ended up moving back to the\nUS\nso what I'm trying to tell you is like\nyou kind of have to go and upskill\nyourself and like I was making the\nanalogy of a video game you're the\ncharacter and you got to go like power\nyourself up to get the best option best\nchance to land a role and if for\nwherever you are having a degree is\nwhat's going to do it then you're gonna\nhave to do it that's just a reality\nright but if you're in an area where\nit's like oh I don't really need a\ndegree I'm totally fine then go learn\nthe basics of\nuh bash python networking uh Cloud\nplatform pick any of the big three\ndevops on mentals and then in like six\nmonths you got two projects two certs\nand then get a year of like support a\ntechnical support experience you bundle\nall that in like a year year and a half\nyou have everything you need and then\nyou can go start applying to your Cloud\nroles\nokay well I'm not using jetbrains and\nthis is already here so I don't need\nthisokay\nso I'm not I'm gonna delete this\nokay I know I'm probably I'm probably\nmessed some stuff up okay get out\neverything no it's like what does it get\nremove\nDash\ncached\nI think it's this\nnow we're moving okay hold on hold on\nokaylike that that yeah yeah there we go\nokay so now I think I can do git add\nboom get commit\nadded infra files and updated get ignore\nI don't know if it's gonna work let's\nsee\nI hate having get error so I really hope\nthat this doesn't work I mean this\ndoesn't give me an errorno we're gonna get an error why though\nwe put that\nit says fivepercent you may\nit's still trying to grab the uh hold on\nfrom where though terraform\nuh file Dash terraform but if you you\nwere told to ignore this file\nto ignore this folder\nDash terraform\ninfrayou were told to ignore this\nthe history[Music]\nlet me see\nyou were told to know ignore this F\ndirectory why are you not ignoring itpushing his care you know\nwhat is yourand you oh my goodness\nhow okay hold on how much does the data\nstructures and algorithms has in your\nsuccess in mine none and yours it could\nbe a totally different story\nyep agreed here in the Philippines for\nTech roles Tech related degrees are\nstill highly regarded depends on a lot\nwhere you live or plan to work at yeah\nthat's why I don't like Tech influencers\nout here being like get a job in Tech in\nsix months you can do this I did this\nanyone could do this like that is just\nnot reality anyone can do it yeah but\nlike what worked for one person might\nnot work for another person for a bunch\nof good reasons Landing a job is 50 in\ncontrol and 50 luck so in that within\nthat 50 of what can you control like\nit's not the same for you and for me\nright I'm just trying to be honest with\ny'allmaybe Dash Dash\nDash Dashdo you use QE forget like no I don't I\nalso do Camilla stuff so I need to\nreference this folder here\nand I'm pretty sure I've done this\nsummer so we'll take a look at what's\nwrong hereinfrahow\nto reference a folder okay let's do it\nthis way let's do it this way okay I\nhave hold on all right I have a folder\ncalled\ninfra and in it are terraform files\nhow can I ignore\nignore this direct this folder this\nfolder in my git ignore\nfile\nwait\nactually let's just do this I have a\nfolder called infra\nhow can I ignore\nin in my root in my root directory\ndirectory how can I ignore this folder\nin my git ignore file all right let's\nsee if this workswhat is your preferred language for\nscripting in Azure Bash bastion.net\noh look at I think we missed this y'all\nlet's seelet's seeokay\nget remove that recursively\nDash cached all of itokay get add everything get commit\nthe same message that I did Above This\nget pushnope still failingwhat What DOT terraform\nin front\ninfra dot tariff why this I feel like\nthis should be so simple but why has is\nthis not working let me thinkinfra it's in this folder and in this\nfolder that is another why is this not\ncommit just get ignored maybe ahhold onbut it's cached alreadyokay get\na move because it's cached\nget commit\nremoved cached files\nget push\nwait did I addnooh I forgot to addtry the asterisk asterisk at the front\nOkay let's seeI feel like I've done this before though\nso I gotta I just gotta find it I feel\nlike I did this in this projectsee like this worksyou know what I'm saying y'allinfra right herein infra we have dot terraformso this should workeverything that is cached[Music]\nyou probably need to commitno nookay let's figure this out\nget removed\nfilespreviously added\nadded git ignore\ngit ignore get ignore something like\nthat\nokay here we go how do I make git forget\nabout a file that was tracked but now\nget ignore okay so it says\nto stop track of file we must remove it\nfrom the index to remove a folder\non the kit remove dash R dash dash\ncached yeah that's what I didwhere are we okay\nget removed dash dash cash boom\nit did not match any files ahthere we go so it's notremoving API removing\ninfrared at terraform okay here we go\nand for DOT terraform.lock and for okay\nokay okay here we go we need you to not\ncopy\nokay\nliterally everything in terraform like\nit says to do everythingso hold onactually let me uh I wanna I don't know\nwhy it's not tell me it just says\nproviders\nterraformwell it's not supposed to remove this[Laughter]\noh hold on we don't need these any\neithert\nokay\nhold on let's do that again\nwe'll just do get add and then get\nremoved cached\nand it says it's gonna remove\nthat terraform.lock but it doesn't say\nit's gonna remove this onethis is the folder I need you to notget statusI should be\nhold on get infra Dashall right hold on\nit is it in Gray and vs that is ignored\nyeah it isn't gray it's gray this is\ngrayed outbut the lock is not grayed out why is\nthat not that great out\nlet's see\nuh\ndot terraformDot Lock\ndo you push y'all do you push the\nlock.hcl to get\nI don't think so rightor you dowhat was the error though what was the\nerror saying whatyeah this is great it's not gonna go\nit's not gonna go andOkay cool so then let's add that\nhold on a second where's the terraform\nstuffthat infra\ndot terraform Dash\n[Music]\ndot Turf tear form\nthe luckall right\nthis this thingy this all right so now\nwe do this right now Duke's status wait\nno no\nget\nthere we go okay now it's grayed out\nI think so\nhold on\nI'm confused againokay\nuh added edit ratings\nadded infra files and get ignore\nI swear I'm going to lose my mind y'allno it's not gonna work whatit says maybe we have large files in\nbefore ignoring commit yeah but that's\nwhat the cash that's what the cash\ncommand is doing the cache command like\nremove cache is supposed to remove us\nfrom us right\nfile name for that telephone pressure\nsure iswe want to try get large fileget\nokay you know what hold on get removed\ncached\nremove dash dash\nokay hold on a second okay\ninfra Dash Terror Forum terraform\nthere okayoh waitget removed do I have to how do I do\ndirectory\noh recursively right I think it's Gotta\nBe Like That\ninfra\ndash dash dot terraform no this is not\ngonna work I can tell already because\nit's not autocompleting\nget removed\nuh\ninfrawhat is going on with my terminal hold\nonwhat is going on exceed limit for cash\ncash removed only from stage so when it\nfails maybe we have large file the cash\nremoved only from stage see I had to be\ncareful the other day I assumed because\nof line Innings I made it using\nand where I made the file through the ID\nand it worked search for error you will\nfind solution oh my gosh dude thank you\nso muchI really do I need to search for the air\nto find the solution come on man\nwe're trying to we're trying to we're\ntrying to challenge ourselves here okay\nso\nwhy is this folder first of all it's\ngrayed out\nright it's great out rightso\nwe're probably you guys are right we're\nprobably pushingoh but then I have to re reset the head\nback to maybe that's the thing\numwhere whyare you saying thatoh my goodness okayuh\nokay so we'll do this terraform git\nignorelet's do thislocal terraform directoriesokay we'll add this someone did say to\naddto add the dash dash the dot the\nasterisk double asterisk at the\nbeginning sowait did Istill gonna failbut it's all gray now\nso that's goodcheck commits history yeah I know I'm\ngonna have to do that now\nuh sothis is probably like this too rightand all the recipesactually let me look at what is saying\nhereI should have just stuck to thisshould I be Dougie he's a great uh\nCommunity member in the open source\nspace so we're just gonna do thisdouble deerget\nget where\nget removed recursively\nuh Dash cached\ncashed in here get add\ngit commituh get pushadd your ignored first by itself and\ncommit thatdelete everything push it no this is I\ndon't know why it's still tracking this\nit's literally right here it's and it's\ngrayed out[Music]all right check commit history yeah yeah\nyeah yeah\noh let's see what this is hereget removed previously files I think\nthis was itwait noI did this to remove a foldermm-hmmwe must follow it from the index\nwe must remove it from the index that is\nwhat we're doing\nall right we'll do this specifically the\ninfra folder okay\nsay infra infra boom\nokay\nadd everything\nI think that's the culprit get commit\nwhat's am no just m adding in for\nfilesokay yeah this is what we gotta remove\nthis we're gonna get push\nwe got uh edityeah this is gonna failokayget edit commit historychange most recent no I don't want to\nhit the choose commit files\nremember father for safety but we did\nthe commit yeah yeah yeah yeah but I\nthought I thought commit uh remove cash\nwould do it but I guess not\nwhat's the command to\nthis this this get reflog let's\nthere and see if it's not gonna get easy\nrecordkick mid to change your latest log\nmessage get commitment to make obviously\nis the most recent commit get rebase\ncommit and modify history of Branch Gary\ngives much more fine-grained control\nover it\nI think it's this I think I've used this\nbeforebut let's do it get\nremove commit from history there we goyeah I know it's something like that\nlike with the head thing I just don't\nknow exactly what it is\nthis says remove commit from history I\nenteredI entered a curse word in my code and I\npushed the code on the master branch\nI push the code a few more times after\nthat so people do not pull the bad stuff\nbut I can still find the curse word in\nthe commits history\nall right\nonce you push the reach you don't really\nwant to go changing however if you're\nabsolutely sure that nobody is pulled\nthe first okay you have two options if\nyou want to remove the bad commit\naltogether every commit the camera do a\ngood reset hard assuming\nABC's the hash of the bad commits and if\nyou want just edit commit Pacific\ncommits thank you but how do I get the I\ncan't reset dash dash hard\nsomeone say soft\nget revert to revert I committed from\nhistory if you want to get revert maybe\nthat's what you're looking for get\nrevert okay one second\nif you want to edit that commit and\npursue the commits that came after that\ndo a get rebased much editorget rebased Dash I okay that's what we\nneed for right nowget rebase Dash I\nall rightcreated added infra okay so this is the\none that messed everything up rightpick created info files\nokayso we have that now right oh dude we're\ngoing for a ride\nman who knew that git was the thing that\nwas gonna get me stuck today right\nokay if you want to remove bad commit to\nthe\nis the hashback commit the one you want\nto see is that\npush force or get push okay so git reset\nDash get\nreset\ndash dash hard\nthatokaynowthe one you want to see is a new head of\ncommit a branch then do a good push\nForce but this commit still has the file\nright let's see get rebaseoopshow do I delete this commit all rightrebase pick reword edit squash fix up\nbreak drop label reset so essentially I\nwant yeah I guess I want to delete this\nthis pic viewer squash break drop remove\ncommit okay so if I say\ndrop right and then I do write out boom\nboom exitoh my goodness did I lose everythingI lost where's my terraform file\noh my goshokay\none second y'alluh what was it code me wait no hold on\nuh code infra main.tfyeah there we go\nboom oh my goodness I almost lost\nabsolutely everything\nOkay cool so now\nwhat else did we lose okay so since\nthat removed everything I would have to\ndo\nand apply to generate all the additional\nstuffbut I don't need that because I know it\nworks for now right\nso now where I'm at is\nuh git add wait hold onit's still in the get ignore rightwhere's the stuff hereterraform no it's not here\noh back here here we go okay here we go\nhere we go here we go\nhold on people\nwe're gonna copy this\nand we're gonna paste this in hereand we're gonna paste that in there so I\nhaven't added anything yet\nso now if we do get at everything\nget commit\nadded infra files\ntwo files change\n89 get push\noh my goodness it worked\nall right let's go back hereand we have an infra folder and we have\nthe main.tf let's go we figured it outokay coolumoh my goodness what a pain y'all\nwhat a freaking painall right we're good we're good we're\nfreaking goodI just said I hope that state file is\nsomewhere safe wait get revert to undo a\ncommit git filter\nDash Branch filter index remove dash cat\noh my look at all these I saw you're\nhitting too many dangerous kick commands\ntoo many get filter get filter stop stop\nsending the same comment I hope that is\nthe right version of the TF file Kappa\noh yeah it isbecause hold on watch\nCD infra\nclear unless\nterraform validatetariff oh no terraforming it is gonna\nokay this is a good testthis is a good test because it because\nit generates a folder for us\nright\nwe do get status we haven't added\nanything so\nokay\nterraform lock on track\nshould this folder this should this file\nbe in git\nlet's Google it\nactually it's actually should\nhold onshould be in\nget I guess Version Controlokay it is all right coolwe're good y'all we're good how long\nhave we been streaming one second let me\ncheck\nI feel like we've assume for a minute\nnow\nan hour ten okay that's not that bad we\ngot a lot we got we got to get my work\ndone y'all we we should we struggled we\nsuffered\nbut we we got this done and hold onand most importantly my streak is still\nstrong\nwhere is itcome onit's not loading here let's go over here\nuh uh here herethere we go look at that look at that\ncontribution graph\ndude\nso since\nFebruary 23rd almost a month now I've\nbeen doing something every single day\nI did do something on March 12th but I\nthink it was learn a cloud and then\nRichard ended up having to make some\nchanges there so it removed the\ncontribution from that date and it broke\nbut I know I've been doing this just\nkeeping the street consistent\nokay\nso cool\nthis is like a good movie with drama\ngets like a gets like the villain of the\nmovieum\nall right\nwe got we got a lot of work donemost importantly now I have some\nhands-on experience with terraformhe generated some decent a decent like\nstarter template but in reality if I had\njust gone to the terraform documentation\nI probably would have been like better\noff\nfor sure\nbecause and what I ended up doing was\ncopying the code that it generated but\nthen putting it in and then did\nterraform validate and all that stuff\nwas not necessarily the best\nso I had to update it anyway so anyway\nso cool all right streak is consistent\nuh I love it love it got some good work\ndone today like you know what they say\nlike a little bit of code and Cloud a\nday keeps the doctor away so I'm good\nI'm good for today\nuh let me just make sure everything 's\nhere get statuscommit\nadded terraformoh there you push\ncool all right let me close this\nall right let's answer some questions\nthat I probably missedI just said I hope\nwe're good we're good we're good\nthis is also the beauty ofis also the beauty of um having your own\nprojects where you don't necessarily\ncare what massive mistakes you could\npotentially makewe're just testing prod y'all testing\nprod\ncap fill in thank you so much you helped\nout a lot really appreciate it\nput up Ethanan interactive rebase yeah get oh my\ngoodness getit was a good time it was a good time\ngood time all right sowe killed it today y'all helped meI'm definitely going to keep the\nrecording of the stream don't worry\nit'll be available for people to to\nwatch later all right I'm going to\nto to\nstop streaming in a little bit but let's\nask some questions\nSaturday's project day every day is\nProject day baby but especially Saturday\nbut it's really nice out I wish I could\nshow you all so it's really nice out but\nin the I went out in the morning went\nfor a nice little run beautiful you know\nit's important to keep yourself uh it's\nmore to exercise for the past couple of\nI would say several weeks I've been sort\nof in like depressed is a very strong\nword but like there's been a lot going\non so whenever stuff like that happens\nit's easy for anyone really to kind of\nforget to take care of themselves\nand you know that kind of stuff so kind\nof now just recently in this past week\nor so been getting back into into the\ninto the zone of like taking care of\nmyself and stuff like that so it's also\ngreat that it's starting to get warm\nlike I'm looking outside because I have\nlike a lot of natural light in the in\nthe room and I have like these massive\nwindows so I'm like oh it's gonna be a\ngreat time for the rest of the day uh\njust go out enjoy the day and I don't\nknow maybe get\num go somewhere I want to go go-karting\nbut my girlfriend does a lot of homework\nso she said like she said we can't go\nbut maybe I'll go with myself\n[Music]\num\nyeah enjoy the day I I'm happy that I\ngot like some deep work done today with\nthis stuff with help of y'all\nso that's goodit's 1am in India Shadow Indiaall right\nthat's it big chilling for the rest of\nthe day thank you all for hanging outum I don't know maybe I'll show I'll\nhave to do this again sometime soon this\nis a lot of fun like this is one of the\nfunnest streams I've done in a while\nuh but I'll stream on Friday maybe just\nsome casual Chit Chat\nall right peace out\nhave a great
