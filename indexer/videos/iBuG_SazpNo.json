  "title": "How to become a Cloud Administrator",
  "transcript": "a cloud administrator is the person in\ncharge of maintaining and provisioning\ncertain cloud infrastructure you'll be\nexpected to develop a lot of high level\nskills and not necessarily\ndive into or specialize anything or into\nanything specifically now\ni think this is what makes the cloud\nadmin role\na friendly role for people who don't\nhave much\ntech experience and are looking to break\ninto the cloud computing space but don't\nlet the broadness or the general\nsense of the role scare you away because\nif you come into the role knowing that\nyou want to specialize and go into a\nspecific cloud discipline\nin a cloud admin role\nyou will most likely get exposure to\nthat discipline to some extent\nyou can sort of think of the cloud admin\nrole like\nyour first couple of years at university\nexcept you're going to get paid right\npersonally this is a route i took and\nit's a route that i've seen other people\ntake including colleagues that i have\nnow at microsoft\nlike all cloud roles it really is going\nto depend on the structure of your team\nthe size of your team uh what you end up\nbeing tasked with and of course your own\nperformance but my goal for this video\nis to explain the cloud admin role and\ntasks and skills that are generally\nexpected\nfrom cloud admins and provide you\nresources that you can use to learn\nthose skills\nwith all that being said hi i'm gps and\nwelcome to a new video alright so the\nname of the game for cloud admins is\nprovisioning your goal is to set up the\ninfrastructure\nin the cloud following best practices\nvia something like a cli\nso that's using commands or putting\ncommands together and creating scripts\nwith something like powershell python\nor bash or maybe even taking it a step\nfurther and learning a full-on\nprogramming language if you like it's\nnot usually a full-on requirement to\nknow a programming language for a cloud\nadmin role but it doesn't\nit doesn't not help\nespecially if you want to specialize in\na cloud discipline like cloud developer\ndevops engineer sre learning a\nprogramming language is absolutely going\nto help with that\nbut yeah your goal is to provision\ninfrastructure into your cloud\nenvironment and once it's provisioned\nproviding the correct access to\nwhichever team needs access to it right\nso for example these data science\nvirtual machines right\ni'm going to go provision it to whatever\nspecification i was told that need these\nvirtual machines need and then i need to\nmake sure that the data engineering team\nis like hey data engineering team here\nare your virtual machines here is how\nyou access them right\nnow\nin terms of creating that access\nproperly and securely you're going to\nneed to understand whatever identity\na service your cloud platform uses so\nfor example azure active directory is\nthe one that azure uses so you'll need\nto know how to properly create users how\nto properly assign permissions to users\nand applications you can also see in\nthis diagram we have like a managed\nidentity that would be through something\nlike azure active directory as well\nand i would also tag along to this is\ncost\nmanagement in terms of like\nunderstanding or knowing how to find how\nmuch a service is costing knowing how to\nimplement budgets and alerts i believe\nis also super important for a cloud\nadmin\nright so again the name of the game\nprovisioning\nyou're setting up the infrastructure and\nthen giving the proper access to\nwhichever teams needs access to that it\nmight sound easy\nor relatively straightforward but there\nare a lot of\nsort of high-level areas that you need\nto develop here so for example we have a\nnetworking aspect because look here we\nhave network security group we've got a\nv-net\nwe've got a firewall i need to\nunderstand what these things are before\ni can provision them so having a solid\nnetworking foundation i believe is very\nimportant here\nthere's also a foundation in scripting\nand using commands as well because\nthat's what you're going to use to\nprovision this infrastructure right\ni would also say cloud fundamentals very\nimportant understanding cloud best\npractices like i just mentioned identity\ncost management all these kinds of\nthings very important as well in another\narea i would like to tag on to sort of\nwhat a cloud admin needs to develop is\na good understanding of devops practices\nusually cloud admins cloud developers\nand cloud devops engineers will work\nhand in hand the cloud admin will do the\ninitial setup and then in terms of\nautomating any updates to that\ninfrastructure that was set up by the\ncloud admin the cloud admin will need to\ntalk with a devops engineer and they'll\nbe a back and forth until that pipeline\nis smooth in terms of resources that i\nrecommend to use i've summarized all of\nthis if you go to learn to cloud dot\nguide you'll find it there i've broken\nit down into a couple of phases there's\nfour here\nlinux networking scripting like i\nmentioned programming fundamentals cloud\nplatform fundamentals and devops\nfundamentals\nyou could potentially skip the\nprogramming one if you have no interest\nin going into a discipline with cloud\ndevelopment whatsoever you can skip that\nand then just do one three and four or\nyou can do whichever one you want really\nthis is more so just\nthe way i recommend each phase will tell\nyou why this how this applies to cloud\nhow to break it down some resources some\nprojects and some things that you need\nto be familiar with in terms of every\nphase\nyeah so name of the game for cloud\nadmins is provisioning there's also some\nmaintenance in there too\nfor example if a hard drive is becoming\n[Music]\nfull on a virtual machine and no one\nknows why it might be your job to go in\nand figure out what's going on there if\nthey need some sort of task automated uh\nsomething like a a virtual machine needs\ncertain files to be moved from azure to\nthe virtual machine locally\nyou might be tasked to do that with\nsomething like powershell and a z copy\nor something like bash et cetera et\ncetera right so there's a lot of\nmaintenance things in there too and\nagain when you think about those\nsort of tasks that i just mentioned\nthere's some scripting in there there's\nsome networking in there there is some\num\nlike being able to go into the cloud\nplatform and check the logs and\nmonitoring for oh finding out what's the\nissue with the disk getting full right\nuh again cloud admin high level lots of\nhigh level things not specific in any\none area but that's the beauty of this\nrole is that you'll get exposure to a\nbunch of different areas and who knows\nwhat you might end up liking you just\ngotta keep an open mind\nall right that is it for this video the\nnext one i think i'm gonna do is cloud\ndeveloper and then we'll do cloud devops\nengineer\nbut yeah thanks for watching i'll see\nyou in the next one",
