  "title": "The Solution Architect Role Confuses Me!",
  "transcript": "so I'm about a year and a half into my\ncareer and usually I guess historically\nif you look back at my career\nprogression around this time is where I\nmake a move either in roles in companies\nor in both now I know I want to stick to\nMicrosoft so I don't want to switch\ncompanies so 50 of that decision has\nbeen made so now my focus has been more\nso around okay what's my next move I\nmade the mistake of sort of universally\ntargeting the solution architect role\nand I even tweeted this out I'll add a\nscreenshot here like I'm focusing on\nsugar solution architect or I'm\ntargeting position architect after my\ntime in advocacy got a couple of replies\nand one really stuck out to me and\nreally helped me understand sort of the\nI guess mistakes or confusion that I\nhave around sort of blatantly just\nsaying like oh Target solution architect\num I also posted this on on Instagram\nand I got another reply which also gave\nme good insight into this too and I want\nto kind of share this because I feel\nlike oftentimes beginners or people who\nare trying to make moves into the space\nor move up in the space we tend to\nfixate on roles like devops Engineers\nthe same everywhere Cloud engineer is\nthe same everywhere switching Architects\nis the same everywhere and in reality\nthat's not the truth and given that I\nhave a couple of years in the field I\nstill got Bamboozled well I'm pretty\nsure that could happen to anyone so kind\nof just wanted to share my insight here\nnow the first reply that stuck out to me\nwas by Linda Nichols Linda Nichols is\nsomeone that I have a lot of respect for\nuh he started a career in help desk\nwrote the help desk ticketing system\nsoftware that's how she learned how to\ncode later went on to get a computer\nscience degree was one of the first\nwomen in serverless back in like the\nearly 2010s\num and someone who works as a global\nblack belt in Microsoft meeting has a\ngreat level of knowledge in a technical\ntechnological category and then goes and\nimplements the solutions and helps build\nout Solutions with customers in that\nspace and I even have a full interview\nwith her so check it out just overall\nsomeone that I've known about for a\ncouple of years and someone who also has\ninsight into the work that I do into the\nthings that I enjoy and could\npotentially give like some good advice\ngiven that she has context about me we\nhad a conversation after she replied to\nmy tweet saying like hey I have some\nthoughts let's talk about this we had a\nconversation and overall she just gave\nme a better feel of like a view of of\nhow the shark that could be different\nbased on teams based on organizations\nbased on company days and there are some\nsushaktak roles that are very sales\nbased very pre-sales based very quota\nbased or just something I don't have any\ninterest in and there are some that are\nreally focused on implementing which is\nsomething that I do have interest in but\nmore so just saying like hey I want to\nbe a solution architect might not be the\nbest way to get into things because\nyou're really kind of just not preparing\nfor anything specific and when you want\nto go Target your next role you really\ndo have to be specific because you got\nto know what to upskill in so I really\nappreciated her insight and her advice\nand her mentorship on that and it's just\na good example of how having you know\nthe right people around you give you\nsome good advice and good first-hand\nknowledge to experience can make an\nimpact on you so thank you Linda\nthe the next person that reached out to\nme was someone who's actually a senior\nCloud social architect at Microsoft with\nyears of experience uh they didn't reply\npublicly so I won't disclose any of that\ninformation of course but we ended up\nhaving a conversation we had a\nconversation when I first started at\nMicrosoft\nand after that we ended up having a\nconversation after this reply uh to my\nInstagram story and more so this person\njust gave me insight into what they do\nas a solution architect and I thought\nthis was so cool this is exactly what I\nwant to do and this was obviously a\ndifferent team and what they end up\ndoing is doing customer engagements for\na certain amount of time a couple of\nweeks or something like that you onboard\nyou learn to Tech stack you use that\nTech stack that the customer uses to\nimplement the solution and then you go\non we offboard do the documentation and\nyou go on to your next customer\nengagement and that next customer\nengagement could be completely different\nTech stack now what I love about\nadvocacy which is the space that I'm\ncurrently in is just the dynamic nature\nof it you could be working on something\nfor a month two months and the following\nmonths it could be something completely\ndifferent I like trying new things given\nthat the cloud space has so many\ndifferent fields I just really like\ngetting a little bit of a taste of all\nthe areas and I truly do believe that if\nI was in a role where I had to do the\nsame like use the same stuff for like a\nreally long time work on the same thing\nfor a really long time it's just not\nsomewhere where I could shine\nwhich is why I do like the nature of\narchitecture in general because you're\ngoing to go build out things that are\ndifferent solutions for different\ncustomers which is something that I feel\nlike I really want to do so after\ngetting the inside with this second\ncolleague more so on how their team\nworks and how there's time to upskill to\nlearn the tech stack how you really rely\non your team your team player because\nsomeone might be an expert in something\nyou might be the expert in a different\narea I think that's really cool so then\nI got a few for what that looks like\nwhich I think was very very useful long\nstory short and the device that I have\nhere is reverse engineer right just\nbecause you want to be in a specific\nrole it doesn't mean that you're going\nto have to learn the exact same thing\nfor that role at every single company\nyeah there might be some overlap in\ngeneral knowledge but overall there\nmight be something a little bit\ndifferent that you have to learn so be\nsure to grab the job description reverse\nengineer that too one thing I wanted to\nadd here is this is something that Lou\nfrom open up the cloud brought up in one\nof the videos that he did a couple\nmonths ago and I'll link that in the\ndescription is\nthere's the one of the most popular\ncertifications to get into cloud is the\nAWS certified solution architect\nassociate and I feel like a lot of\npeople who get into these space uh via\nthat certification or sort of that's\ntheir introduction to learning cloud or\nsort of you know the first step that\nthey take into trying to figure out what\nthey want to do is they think that\nbecause solution architect is in the\nname of the certification that that's\nthe role that they have to Target\nand also they feel like the what they're\nstudying in that role is what they're\nexactly going to end up doing and that's\njust not the truth right right so again\nreverse engineer the the role grab the\njob description and then that's pay\nattention to what you're actually going\nto work on versus the title itself I\nneed to take my own advice long story\nshort all right anyway uh let me know\nare you a social architect what do you\ndo day to day is sales a very big part\nof your role uh let me know in the\ncomments um also let me know what kind\nof roles you're targeting I would love\nto know people's career progressions\nI'm still very much trying to figure out\nwhat the next one thing the next thing\nfor me is the I think what is different\nthis time around than other times where\nI've been trying to figure out my next\nrole is I'm very happy my current role\nI'm still very much challenged I'm\ncompensated fairly I have a great team a\ngreat manager so there's not like a lot\nof pressure as to like I'm not it's not\nthat I'm not happy or anything like that\nbut progression is very important to me\nso\nwe'll see we'll see what happens I hope\nyou learn something and I'll see in the\nnext video",
