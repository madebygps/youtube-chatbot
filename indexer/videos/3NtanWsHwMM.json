  "title": "10 Questions You Should Ask During Your Tech Interview",
  "transcript": "have you ever had a conversation with\nsomeone where you're talking to them and\nthey're answering with just like yeah\naha sure sounds good sounds great\nthat is exactly how you don't want your\ninterviews to go let me repeat that is\nexactly how you don't want your\ninterviews I have\ndeveloped some skills when it comes to\ninterviewing\nand today I sat down to write out a list\nof questions that whenever I interview\nnext given the current market this could\nbe something like tomorrow right\nbut yes if I compiled a list of things\nthat I would ask during an interview now\nI will say these questions are very\nrandom I haven't really organized them\nin terms of like what stage of an\ninterview would I ask them in\nbecause\ndifferent companies depending on the\nsize or whatever process they have in\nplace will have different stages you\nhave like a phone slash screening\ninterview maybe you'll have uh one\ninterview on cultural fit another\ninterview on technical interview a panel\na whole bunch of options right\nso I had some more so just questions in\ngeneral that I would ask and you should\nsee fit you should see where these best\nfit along the process that you're going\nto okay so let's switch to the screen\nand the first one is look at that the\nfirst one I put in here is interview\nprocess\nthis is the best place to ask for is\nobviously in your first whether it be in\nlike a phone screen or whatever that\nfirst way of contacting\nuh the or the first the first your first\npoint of contact for the interview is\nright uh how many how many rounds to\nexpect\nand if there is a technical interview\nhow will it be conducted what are\nexamples of\nlike uh things that have been asked\nbefore\noftentimes if the company is large\nenough you can look up\npast examples of interviews questions\nand the technical aspect that having us\nso asked before oftentimes other\ncandidates who have landed jobs or have\nnot landed jobs but who have gone\nthrough the process have shared their\nexperiences online and you know lead\ncode is a very big thing uh because of\nthis right\nbut in the cloud space I would say\nsomething like data structures and\nalgorithms and the whole leak code\nuh thing is not as pronounced as in the\nsoftware deaf\nand there isn't really like\nsomething likely code in the cloud and\ndevops space\nI tend to see a lot more of like\nwhiteboarding\nokay like how would you like whiteboard\nlike diagram the solution out for us oh\nwe have this solution uh what service\nwould you change or which service would\nyou implement to improve the performance\noh we have this solution we're having\nthis error how would you go about\ntroubleshooting it like things like that\nright\nbut anyway these are things you should\nget a feel for in this initial phone\ncall so all about the interview process\neverything else after this is\njust a brain dump and\nagain just see fit where\nwhere uh it's best for you to ask this\nright so the first the second one is ask\nabout team\nand then organization and Company\nstructure the reason I have like all\nthree is because you know depending on\nthe size of the company maybe it's just\na 10 it's like 10 people in the whole\ncompany then they probably don't have\ndifferent organizations they probably\njust have different teams or something\nlike that or maybe it's all one big team\nbut asking about the structure will give\nyou an idea of\nhow many hats you're gonna wear in the\nroll so for example\nmy first role was at a medium-sized\nmedium-sized company no more more maybe\na little larger I think it was a couple\nthousand employees\nand\nbut it wasn't big Tech\num like big Tech size and the role is\nvery defined in coming into it and it\nwas pretty like what was in the\ndescription was very aligned with what I\nwhat I ended up doing later on when I\nmoved into a more startup type company I\nthink they were uh initially 40 30 40\nemployees that was just wearing many\nmany hats but they made that very like\nthey made the person who was applying to\nthe role very aware of that by saying it\nin the description\nif that's a good or bad thing that's\nreally up to you oftentimes being in a\nrole where you have many hats to wear\ncouldn't be a good thing but some people\ndon't like it right but just so\nunderstand the company structure uh to\nget a better feel for that\nnext I have here ask about team\norganized or organization or company\nyeah team or organization\nresponsibilities and focuses again if\nyou ask this on Team level on the\norganization level will depend on the\nsize of the company and you'll get a\nbetter understanding of this by asking\nthat previous question about the\nstructure\nbut yeah understand what your team is\nresponsible for what your team is\nfocused on and sort of what things you\ncan expect to deliver\nin the role that you're in okay\nthis fourth question is one that I have\nnot asked before but is something that I\nam definitely going to ask moving\nforward other departments you'll work\nwith the most especially in advocacy\nuh I the interest of me asking this\nquestion is to get a better feel for\nokay is the advocacy I'm going to be\ndoing more engineering for focused or\nmore marketing focused and I want to\nknow what teams am I going to be working\nwith the most outside of my most\nimmediate team\nso that's why that question is here but\nif you aren't going for a different role\nlike say you're in a cloud role like and\nthey tell you oh you don't really work\nwith a bunch of other teams you kind of\njust stick to your own team that may or\nmay not be a red flag because it you\nknow cloud devops\nDev should all be pretty collaborative\nuh but yeah it's something to to ask\nabout okay then this next question I\nhave here is job training\nhow long are you considered oh there's\nmultiple Parts here how long are you\nconsidered onboarding uh so oftentimes\nthere's like the 30 day time frame 90\nday 60 day time frame 90 day time frame\nyou have like onboarding goals again\ndepending on the structure and the\nprocess of the company that you're\ninterviewing for\nbut they'll have goals set out for you\nlike oh in your first month you should\nbe able to accomplish this and you're\ntoo in your 60 days you should be able\nto accomplish this and your 90 days you\ncan accomplish you should be able to\naccomplish this and oftentimes companies\nwill have like your 90-day period where\nyou're still sort of being tested out as\nan employee and you're also in testing\nout the role keep that in mind it's also\nall for you to for you to understand\nlike oh this is something that I\nactually want to do or not\nuh but yeah ask about how long does that\nonboarding period look like and what\ndoes that process look like for you\nuh also resources provided to learn a\nlot of companies have like training\nsites that you can access for free or\nmaybe they pay for it and it's part of\nlike a benefit uh do they have do they\npay for certifications tuitions is there\nlike a fund like I remember my help this\ngig though it was really early in my\ncareer and and I wasn't really being\npaid much they had a fund I think it was\nlike a thousand dollars or something\nthat you can use every year to buy books\nand certifications or if you wanted to\nput that towards like a class that you\nwere taking at school they would you\nknow that money was for you to use to\nupskill\nso that was awesome so make sure you\nhave these questions answered early on\nbecause that also tells you like are\nthey committed to helping their\nemployees upscale are they committed to\nhelping their employees stay up to date\nwhich says a lot about a team a manager\nand all that kind of stuff too\nthis next question I have here is role\ngrowth\nand this is all about understanding\nlike what umwhat potential growth you can see like\npromotions or maybe is this a role where\nyou can that could lead into a manager\ntype role you know just understanding\nthat type of stuff\nand some additional questions to ask\nhere is\num people who have been in this role\nwhat girl have they seen or maybe what\nroles have they moved up into or maybe\nthey tend to leave the company I don't\nknow there's a lot of potential answers\nthat you could get here and a lot of\npotential Insight that you could get\nhere\nand then this other one is important too\nlike what processes systems are in place\nfor promotion like is there like a buy\nyearly cycle where people are like they\ngo through some sort of process to see\nif they're eligible for promotion\nuh this tends to be something in larger\ncompanies but I've seen like\nmedium-sized small companies have this\nin place too which I think is fantastic\nI don't really think that this should be\nsomething that is just for larger\ncompanies\num but go ahead and ask that I think\nit's really important to note too\nuh this next one is a detailed\nunderstanding of what my day would look\nlike I can see this probably being a\nbetter question to ask the hiring\nmanager or a peer or someone who is more\ninvolved that usually isn't again\ndepending on the size of the company but\nthat usually isn't that initial phone\ncall that phone screening sometimes it\nmight be but just make sure you get a\nfeel for who to ask this question here\nbut just understand what your date looks\nlike and maybe like over a week too like\nwhen our team meetings what's the\nbalance with meetings and focus work\nlike how often do you work with\ncolleagues how often are you working\nwith colleagues that aren't on your\ndirect team I think this is our\nimportant things to know as well\nnumber eight is what are the team's\nobjectives and focuses for the next\nthree months so this is kind of similar\nto that number three which is ask about\nthe team organization responsibilities\num and focuses but this this one here is\nmeant so more so to ask for peers and\nhiring managers because they're the ones\nwho have a better insight into like what\nis the team focused on and what will you\nbe focused on in your role for the next\nthree months oftentimes these things are\nplanned out in that amount of time\nsometimes more like sometimes they'll\nhave stuff lined up for six months so\nit's a good idea for you to get a feel\nfor okay how like how often does like\nokay what are we working for uh get\ndefined and what is the current\nuh like objectives like okrs or\nwere the other ones KP kpis I think\nsomething like that like there's a bunch\nof different systems out there for\npeople to Define their goals and just in\nin companies and teams to Define their\ngoals so get a feel for what that looks\nlike too and this will also get you a\nbetter understanding of what you can\nexpect to work on once you're onboarded\nor maybe you dive straight into work I\ndon't know but a good question yes sir\ntoo number nine what does planning work\nslash projects look like in the team and\nwho's involved okay this is a great one\nbecause this I mean this goes along with\nnumber eight of course understanding\nwhat's planned out and what's the focus\nfor the next three months but also when\nit comes to figuring that stuff out what\ndoes that look like who's involved who\ngets to ask questions who does it get\nrun by uh what's the say that you have\nwith the projects that are getting\nplanned out things like that\nunderstanding sort of your how your\nInsight and your input would be taken\ninto consideration for works as projects\nI think is very important as well\nnumber 10 how fast is a team and Company\ngrowing this is probably more relevant\nfor companies that aren't like very\nsearchable uh maybe smaller companies\nthat aren't like super\nuh like startups that aren't like super\nknown or or something like that uh this\ngets you gets you an idea for you know\nhow you can expect like if you're in a\nsmall team that's growing really fast\nyou might be able to have a way bigger\nimpact than a team that's already like\nkind of established uh so a good idea\nthere obviously uh if you're trying to\ngo work for big Tech then it's easy to\nunderstand to go and find these answers\nuh the answer for this one specifically\nbut uh for lesser-known companies it's a\ngood question I think to ask\nnumber 11 is a big one which is why I\nhave a bunch of sub bullets in here\nbut number 11 is how would my\nperformance in this role be measured\nthis is your opportunity to understand\nwhat metrics are used if you do hit or\nyou you maybe surpass the metrics or the\ngoals that you have to hit is there a\nbonus\num what systems are in place to make\nsure I'm on track to hit these metrics I\ncannot Microsoft we have this thing\ncalled\num connects which are buy yearly and\nthat's an area for us to reflect and get\nfeedback from our managers in a more\nuh I guess a fish not not official but\nit's like in a system it's written\num\nto understand your progress right\nuh and some companies will have\nsomething like this some companies might\nbe a bit more informal it might be not\nas scheduled whatever like but just get\na feel for that\nhow is feedback delivered and asked for\noh before I move on that so see what\nsystems are in place to make sure you\ntrack this metrics those metrics are\nwhat's what gets defined in the answers\nto the questions eight and nine so what\nare you focusing on for the next three\nmonths and how does that work get\nplanned out so you'll get a better\nfeeling for those this this question C\nof number 11 and those ones they fast\nbefore so also about these questions is\nyou know you want to ask questions\nintently right and you don't want to\njust you like say you ask a question\nand you already got an answer and or you\nmaybe got a little bit more insight to\nanother question that you want to ask\nkeep that in mind right like this isn't\nlike oh one two three four ask all of\nthese like your questions might already\nget answered in previous questions so\ndon't ask them again like I said so I'm\ntrying to say okay\nunless you need further clarification\nthen of course by all means ask like hey\ncould you clarify this right but anyway\nsee uh yeah what systems are in place to\nmake sure that you're on track to hit\nthese metrics or not on track the hit\nmetrics that's important to know too D\nis how is feedback delivered and asked\nfor like is this something that's\ninformal is there a system in place for\nthis uh do we have like guidelines for\nthis a bunch of other things that you\ncould ask really to this\num how often does someone in this role\nexpect to check in with their manager\nlike sometimes there are weekly\ncheck-ins I have weekly check-ins with\nmy manager personally that's something\nthat I would really look forward to in a\nnew role maybe it's like bi-weekly maybe\nit's a couple times a week really\ndepends maybe it's not just with\nmanagers maybe you have check-ins with\npeers maybe you have check-ins with\nskips which is your manager's manager\nmaybe you have check-ins with someone on\na different team I don't know just get\ninsight into what that looks like but\nthis is all this question is all about\nunderstanding what is uh\nlike performance how to make sure you're\non track and the role look like at this\npotential new role number 12 is what\nshould a successful new hire be able to\naccomplish in a year this is probably a\nquestion that's better suited for a\nhiring manager\nand who has someone who has direct\nimpact on the new higher success uh so\nthis is kind of going alongside that job\ntraining going how long are you consider\nonboarding the 30 60 90 plan\nand yeah this is the like the answer\nthat you get here gives you an idea of\nlike what does your leader look like and\nyeah it might be kind of silly to think\nabout oh I don't even have this role and\nI'm already thinking about what a\nsuccess would look like for this role in\na year but that gives you an idea of\nlike what you're going to have to\ndedicate yourself to do and to hit and\nto accomplish in a year and if you don't\nwant to do that then maybe this rule is\nfor you right but the Insight here is is\ngreat for you\non this last one how would you describe\nyour management style uh a manager being\nable to describe their management style\nis important obviously what they tell\nyou is important as well but even just\ntheir ability to answer this uh this\nquestion is I think very telling like if\nthey're very like if you if it seems\nlike inauthentic if it seems like they\ndon't have an answer that might be\nsomething for you to to reflect on uh\nbut yeah another thing that I feel like\nis important to answer\nokay\nthis is a massive brain dump again given\nthe times I'm kind of just sitting down\nand figuring out what these types of\nconversations will look like for myself\num so I wanted to share\nall right I'll see you next video",
