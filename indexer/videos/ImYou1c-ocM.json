  "title": "Ace Your Cloud Interview: How to Whiteboard Elasticity vs Scalability!",
  "transcript": "I was in a cloud engineering interview a\ncouple years ago I remember being so\nembarrassed because I felt like this is\na concept I should have understood\nbefore going into the interview but I\nreally didn't I was asked to explain the\ndifference between scalability and\nelasticity and if I could diagram it out\nor anyway to visually represent it and I\ncouldn't I remember answering it just\nsaying a whole bunch of like buzzwords\nor something like that and I remember at\nthe end of my answer I just thought to\nmyself oh boy there's no way I'm getting\nthis job I didn't get the job so yeah\nnow with a couple of years experience\nsince then let me explain it to y'all in\ncase you ever find yourselves in this\nsituation right so let's switch over to\nthe screen on my left side we're gonna\ndisplay scalability on the right side\nwe're going to display elasticity and\nI'm gonna show on my y-axis I have\ntraffic and resources traffic and pink\nresources in blue and on my x-axis I\nhave time we can say this is like 30\nminutes so it's the same time frame on\nboth left side and the right side here\nokay\nso I got my pencil tool here we'll make\nsure we're set to the right color and\nlet's draw some traffic so let's say we\nhave some traffic like this we have a\nlittle bit of a peek goes back down\nand then we have a bigger Peak sustains\nthere goes down\nand then goes back down here okay\nso let's say this is traffic these are\nusers uh these are you have a sale or\nsomething I don't know let's say you\nhave an e-commerce app or something like\nthat and then your resources which we\nare representing in blue\nso the resources you have allocated for\nyour infrastructure just to handle the\ntraffic uh on average you'd probably\nperform around here right\nand these are sort of manual rules\nactually it's probably going to look\nmore so like this hold on let me grab\nthe eraser uh just Ctrl C that\nit's probably going to look something\nmore so like this it's uh probably gonna\nperform like here and then\nno actually oops probably gonna perform\nlike here\nand then go up the hereand then\nprobably something like this okay this\nisn't it 100 accurate like this isn't\nlike a scientific graph or anything like\nthat but\nwhat I'm trying to\nto convey here is that roughly the\nresources will follow the traffic uh via\nsome like generic or some general rules\nlike\nlet me grab this tool here and let's\ngrab another color let's grab like a\ngreen and you see here we have a peak\nhere\nthen we have a peak here\nbut at this point right here\nand then at this point here so what we\nend up having here\nis so these are our peaks in the traffic\nand suddenly this starts to go up\nso here is where the\ninfrastructurelet's make this a little can I make this\nlarger how can I make this larger like\nthis here we go\nso here it could be a rule like when\nabove 50 percent\nCPU\nutilization\nscale out something like that right so\nwe are going to respond to an increase\nin traffic with this scaling rule\nand the same kind of happens up here\nexcept it's the other way around right\nuh\nwe start to notice that actually this\nmight be closer to here we start to\nnotice that the traffic is going down so\nwhen\nbelow\n50 CPU utilization scale down okay right\nso you're gonna get your resources to\neither scale out\num scale up scale in in this case it\nshould be scale\nscale in\nbecause we're doing scale out and\nscaling right\nand we are in this case we can say that\nwe are\nengineering and Engineering for Peaks\nand we can grab this we're going to put\nthis in\na different color here we're engineering\nfor Peaks here nothing wrong with this\nso workloads that work perfectly fine\nwhen you find when you are just\nutilizing this type of scaling\nelasticity is also a type of scaling but\nit's different we're going to see it in\na little bit\nbut right you you have these sort of\nupfront rules that you put into place\nmaybe you've analyzed your traffic\nbefore and you just know that okay\nwhenever we have Peaks our resources\ntend to require this type of scaling\nBehavior so let's put those we'll Define\nthose rules up front\noverall it can seem like a very\nlike you're making like assumptions and\nlike very manual types of rules being in\nplace\nand it works of course uh for different\nworkloads right\nbut in let me copy this exact\nline of traffic here and we're gonna\nmove it over to elasticity actually I'm\ngoing to switch my camera also this way\nwhat it would look like what our\nresources would look like when it comes\nto elasticity is wait no this is pink\nand then I need to grab\nanother one that is blue\nit aregrab this again but I want to do this\nhere okay\nuh resources would closely follow the\ntraffic\nscale out sustain scale in sustain\nscale out sustain\nscale in sustain scale in sustain right\nI'm going to erase this little dot here\nbecause that has something to do with\nanything\nso here you can see that the scaling of\nthe resources is a lot more Dynamic and\nit's a lot more sudden\nand this is heavily based on metrics\nlogs if you're using Azure it's probably\nsomething like Azure monitor application\ninsights those those types of logs and\nmetrics that are available to you if\nyou're using AWS probably cloudwatch you\nmight be using data or New Relic there\nare a bunch of different sources you can\nutilize right\nso here what we end up doing\nengineering for sudden and dynamic scale\nright now this is obviously going to beway more pricier well I guess way more\ndepends on what your scaling situation\nis up over here\nbut generally\nwe'll just put like two something like\nthat generally elasticity can be more\nexpensive than your standard scalability\nnow elasticity is scalability\nyou are scaling but it's more sudden and\ndynamic like I mentioned so it's kind of\nlike a higher level a higher tier\nwhen you think of scalability you're\nthinking maybe things like scale sets\num like virtual machine scale sets when\nyou think elasticity you're probably\nthinking something like a traffic\nmanager uh like a load balancer\num things like that right where you are\nmatching the traffic suddenly and as\nsoon as possible this is a lot more\nautomatic it's more so putting in place\nlike grabbing the right metrics and the\nright logs and putting them into uh\nwhere they're available to your\nresources so your resource like sees\nlike oh I got this\num I got this metric from the virtual\nmachine that says well from the from\nAzure monitor that says our traffic is\nstarting to go up let me scale myself\nout oh I got this new metric that says\nour\nour traffic is going down let me scale\ndown right so there is a\nslight difference and it's important to\nunderstand when you would use one over\nthe other\nyou know for critical workloads probably\nsomething on the right makes more sense\nbut again you always have to keep in\nmind the cost as everything in cloud\nlike you know you have your pros and\ncons and the cost is always going to be\none of them right so yeah I hope this\nbetter explains these two concepts for\nyou I have a couple other ones that I\nremember doing really really bad out\nthat I want to make more videos on I'm\ngoing to export this diagram and put it\nsomewhere for y'all to be able to\nreference if you need to\nbut if there are any other Concepts you\nwant me to cover let me know and that's\nit for this video",
