  "title": "Passion in Tech Doesnâ€™t Matter",
  "transcript": "all right today I want to talk about\nwhy I think passion in Tech\nis BSI don't think you need passion to get\ninto Tech\nlet's start from the perspective of an\nemployer tell me the last time you were\nyour performance was evaluated because\nof your passion level or like on your\nannual performance review there's like a\nlittle box where you got to talk about\nyour passion\nno\nthat doesn't happentell me the last time you applied for a\nrole and there's been a check box there\nit's like do you have a degree check box\ndo you have passion for the role check\nthere that doesn't existlet's talk about employers replacing\nroles and automating roles with AI and\nml\nif passion mattered to them don't you\nthink that they would not do that\nbecause Ai and ml doesn't have passion\nbut you know random person who's at this\nrole is like this person's really\npassionate we should really keep them we\nshouldn't replace automate them they\ndon't think like that\nthe moment that they can automate and\nsave money they will\nso passion doesn't matter from the\nemployer's perspective and I don't think\nit should because business is business\nlike I said in my previous video about\nloyalty at a company\nlet's take a look at it from the\nemployee perspective I feel like the\npeople who push this narrative that you\nneed passion to get into Tech fall into\ntwo categories there are plenty of\npeople who did get into the space\nbecause they're passionate I'm not\ntalking about them I'm talking about the\npeople who push this narrative so hard I\nfeel like they fall into two categories\nthe first category are the people who\nwant to make themselves feel like\nthey're better or they're Superior or\nthat they're special and the reality is\nthat the majority of people are just not\nsuper special\neveryone's unique everyone has their\nthing that's 100 true\nbut just because you have this fake\nNarrative of passion doesn't make you\nbetter than another person who's also\nworking in Tech okay\nso I feel like that's the first category\nthe second category are the people that\nuse passion as an excuse to not do\nsomething because it's too hard like\npeople can say like oh I can't get into\nTech because I'm not passionate about it\nthe reality is like you just don't have\nenough interest or enough motivation or\nenough discipline to see if it's\nactually something that you want to do\npassion is developed over failure and\nsuccess and repeating that Circle many\ntimes and your ability to put up with\nthat\nso if you're passionate about something\nyou'd be willing to do it without being\npaid like you would be willing to do it\nfor free\nand I'm 100 sure that everyone who is\nlike oh I'm passionate about this this\nrole in Tech if they were like hey your\nsalary tomorrow zero dollars you would\nbe out you'd go look for a job\nASAP\nso that's why I think from the employee\nstamp\nit's like this standpoint of an employee\nit's also BS now the narrative about\nneeding passion to sustain a career in\nTech is interesting\nBut ultimately I really do think that\nyou just need balances you need\nboundaries and you need to work hard to\nhave a fulfilling career\nbecause ultimately what your career\nprovides you is yes you can get\nchallenges you can get growth and all\nthat stuff but at the if you abstract it\nto the highest level it is a business\ntransaction you are out doing some sort\nof job and a business is paying you for\nthat money and that money is what\nprovides you life uh your lifestyle your\nrent your mortgage the things that you\nwant to buy for yourself providing for\nyour family and people can have passion\nfor all those things outside of the role\nand then the money the salary the\npayment it just is just an ends to meet\nthose things right\nso I I don't think you need it to\nsustain a successful career I know\nplenty of people who have even in just\nother fields like I feel like in we we\nwant to make ourselves in Tech feel like\nwe're unique or special because I don't\nknow maybe because of the high salaries\nbut there are plenty people who work\nother careers for like 20 30 years\nthey're not passionate about it yeah I\nwould say this is what I will say if you\ndon't have at least an interest then\nyou're going to be extremely bored and\nyou're gonna not feel challenged and\nthen that's just gonna make you\nmiserable for sure\nso definitely go into a career with some\nsort of interest because you know you\nhave the Curiosity to go and learn new\nthings and then that will help you\neasily get more promotions because\nyou're upskilling stuff like that for\nsure like don't get into Tech\nand if you try it and then he's like oh\nI really don't like this like don't\nstick to it either no if yeah all you\nneed is just some interest right\nand a lot of hard work for sure\num\nbut like I was saying like there's\nplenty of people who are passionate\nabout a bunch of other things and then\nTech just enables them to fulfill those\ntypes of things\nI don't think I've ever been passionate\nabout any role that I've had in my I\nstarted working when I was in in 2014 so\nabout nine years\nup until\nthis last role that I'm in with my\ncurrent role as a cloud developer\nadvocate in Microsoft\nI had a lot of interest and I felt very\nchallenged in certain aspects of other\nroles that I've been and especially the\ncloud engineer one\nwhich made me continue wanting to pursue\nthis cloud computing field\nbut it's not like\nI felt like oh my goodness this is my\nlife calling or this is my purpose like\nI was meant for this like this is what I\nwould do even if I wasn't being paid\nlike no absolutely not\nI have a nice sense of fulfillment and\num there's a lot of overlap between the\nthings that I am passionate about and\nthe work that I do day to day for sure\nI think the thing that I'm most\npassionate about life and that I've\nalways had of like a very soft spot for\nmyself is helping people because of my\nmother my mother is someone who gives\nevery ounce of her to anyone who needs\nit and her phrase that she has instilled\nin me since I was very little was to\ngive with no expectationand as I grew up I was like I want to\nhow do I do this like I have this very\nimportant sort of sense of self\nto help\nbut as a kid you don't really know what\nthat means as a teenager you I was a\nteenager I thought I was going to be a\nmusician like I loved playing guitar I\nloved singing I loved writing songs uh I\ngrew up a little bit more and I learned\nhow to like produce music and use\nAbleton and use midi controllers and\nstuff like that but ultimately when it\ncame down to pricking a profession\nactually starting like picking a major\nin college\nI sat down and I was very real with\nmyself like how am I going to make money\nI had taken some electives that I was\npretty decent at in in high school of\nprogramming\nso I went into systems engineering\nbut I loved\nmusic I loved communication I loved like\ntalking to people and and just overall\nbeing creative I just didn't have like\nthe full image of what that would look\nlike as\nyou know an adult or as maybe a career\nso I went into systems engineering\nbecause I didn't want to be a bum and I\ndidn't want to be poor I dropped out\nobviously after after two semesters and\nthey worked my way up uh into where I'm\nat now but it wasn't until this role now\nwhere I sort of find some overlap\nbetween you know creating technical\ncontent where I get to help others\nbecause I'm teaching something and I get\nto communicate and I get to be creative\nwith the you know because videos making\nvideos and has is a very creative\nEndeavor but that took me you know\n2014 I joined Microsoft in 2021 six\nyearsbut I will also say that this what I do\nnow isn't tied to this role or to this\ncompany like if there was another role\nin another company that enabled me to do\nthis better\nI would go pursue thatand also I could continue to teach and\ncommunicate without having a role that\nhas any overlap with it whatsoever\nyeah I feel like I'm ranting now I'm\ndoing like a brained up now but anyway\nyou don't need passion to get into Tech\nyou just need to work really really hard\nyour ability to work really really hard\nis depends on a lot of things I would\nsay you do need to have an interest and\nyou do need to have a lot of discipline\nbut a lot of that comes from other\nthings in life\nlike for me earlier on I was like I just\nreally don't want to be poor I really\ndon't want to be a bum I really got to\nwork hard in this I really got to work\nmy way up for some people that might be\ntheir family for some people that might\nbe\num I don't know it could be anything you\nmight have a cat that you need to\nprovide for something like that\nall right\nthat's it for this video and for those\npeople who are saying that you need\npassion to get into Tech your\ngatekeeping that's just it",
