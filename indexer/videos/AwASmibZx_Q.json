backactually let me get let me send this\nthis outone sec\nforeignhow we doing\nhappy FridayI'm headed home in a little bit so I\nwanted to stream beforeI leavelet me get this link out too\nall right what up\nwild wild week\nI just heard uh some layoffs happening\nwithin my org within my team and stuff\nlike that sointeresting and difficult week Bachelor\nbeginners is almost oh Josh is here let\nme add Josh\nhey Josh hey how's it going your camera\nsetup is like a little different I'm\ndigging it yeah and we're here now\nI haven't seen this angle of your of\nyour room everyone this is Josh Josh is\na colleague of mine at Microsoft but\nbefore being at Microsoft what did you\ndo I was an S3 at stack Overflow for a\nlittle bit and then before that I was a\ndevops lead\nwow\nthat's impressive how'd you get into it\noh good story oh yeah I could tell the\nPowershell story\num so I was one of those like the the\nblack sheep of the devops movement where\nI was a Windows admin and a Powershell\nperson Powershell scripter so it kind of\nstarted I wanted to go to school for\ncomputer design I don't know how much\ntime we have flux right I'll cut it\nshort but I wanted to go be a game\ndeveloper like anybody\nsaw the six figure price tag decided to\ngo to community college for computer\nnetworking because that was the closest\nthing to that\nuh and then I went up on the help desk I\nworked myself up to system administrator\nnetwork administrator kind of like a\none-man shop jack of all trades rack and\nservers doing all that stuff doing Zen\nserver and Zen app and all that goodness\nthen I landed my cell phone a big\nservice desk where I couldn't just use\nGUI tools and kind of fell into\nPowershell scripting and then\ngot a hold of now my teammate Steve\nmarowski and followed him and he was uh\nhe was at stack before I was a number of\nyears before\nand I kind of wanted to make that my\ncareer path and so I dove into\nAutomation and and devops and\ninfrastructure as code eventually landed\nat stack and then you know right after\nlaying in my dream job that I've been\nworking for for like seven years got the\nopportunity to join Microsoft and I was\nlike well\nI don't know if I can turn that down and\nso then I joined during Microsoft I've\nbeen here about two years now so that's\nthe last 13 years of my life and like a\nminute that was\nvery concise I appreciate I appreciate\nthat\num Josh is also my my co-host for our\nBachelor beginners course coming out\nnext week we were like finishing up last\nminute things today doing last minute\nedits and stuff like that and I'm not\ngonna lie I I really didn't have an idea\nof how it was gonna look like come\ntogether because I haven't well I mean\nwe haven't really spoken about it but\nwe really came we came up with idea we\nonly kind of like talked via like Word\ndocuments and teams but we never really\nhad any practice runs or anything like\nthat but I knew that you would be like\ngreat fit for it because I've seen\nuh your style of delivery and and I\nthink in a way we're pretty similar\nbecause you like to be concise you like\nto be straightforward and it like meshes\nvery well with mine so when I saw it\nlike yesterday and today like the final\nlike versions I was like oh my goodness\nit's it's really really good so I'm\nexcited I decided for it to come out\nthank you for doing for doing that um\nabsolutely my pleasure with me that was\ngreat but yeah I think uh everyone is\nexcited for for that uh\nfor that series it's gonna be great I\nthink uh bash is Bash Powershell\nscripting is such a massive pillar that\nI feel like a lot of people like get\ninto their career and then they end up\ngoing back to learning those Basics and\nthen they can like take steps\nfurther or like all it just unlocks so\nmuch potential even for\nprogramming right or or\nanything that you do now that has a CLI\nit's all like you you go from oh I'm\njust doing these commands without\nknowing what I'm doing to like oh and\nnow I really know how to leverage these\ncommands so I think it really doesn't\nlock kind of like a like a superpower I\nthink maybe people think it's like\ntoo basic or maybe intimidating or\nsomething like that or probably from\neither side it could be balls I think\nI've seen people that are you know\nprincipal level developers that can't\nmove around a terminal and they see it\nbeneath them uh and then people that are\nkind of like more used to GUI tools and\nthey're intimidated by it because it it\nlooks like programming\num so I've seen both but uh my favorite\nstory with with how powerful scripting\ncan be was a couple jobs ago when a\ndevops lead and we had a security\nincident and I was on call and I got a\npage and my manager called me and he's\nlike hey this is a really big deal I\nneed your help and they had deployed uh\nsome software out to everything some\nsecurity software that broke everything\nwe've all kind of been there if we've\nbeen on a help desk security software\nhas that tendency but I was able to pull\nup uh you know a Powershell\nand within a couple minutes just write a\nscript that went and cleaned out the the\ninstallation and then I ran it and\nscaled it with you know Powershell\nremoting across thousands of servers uh\nand saved the day so I mean that's kind\nof the power of it where I didn't have\nto write a program and compile it and\ndeploy the binary everywhere and then\nrun it I just wrote a script and I was\nable to remotely execute that everywhere\nso it's it is a superpower I think a lot\nof people don't realize that like a lot\nof these commands are also\nthemselves almost complete programs like\nthink of correct\nright like how capable there's like\nentire books on just grip the single the\nsingle Command right so I don't know\nit's it's I'm excited uh it's gonna be\ngreat I didn't know you also had maybe I\ndid her but I forgot that you have a\nhelp desk background how long did you do\nthat how like how did that what so what\nwhat came after that and like talked\nabout uh talk to me about that impact\nsure so the the help desk was like\nstraight out of college I joined a small\nengineering firm\num there were like maybe 300 people or\nsomething like that and I was you know\nmy first project was migrating everybody\nI'm dating myself now migrating\neverybody to Windows 7. uh it's because\nit just just came out and so they're all\non XP and so that's where it started I\nwas on the help desk for about two years\nand then I\num moved into a network admin role which\nwas really assist admin\na network basically a one-man shop so I\nran uh all the it for a small bank so I\nwas on the help desk for two years then\nI went to network and I still had to do\nthe help desk because I was a one-man\nshop I was both the help desk a network\nadmin you know running cables across the\nthe campus and the buildings and stuff\nlike that there's actually this remote\noffice in a small town out in Nebraska\nwhere I had to run like a 100 no about\n200 foot cable just down the street to\nthe other building to connect them\nbecause they didn't want to pay for two\nendpoints uh so I did that but then I\nwent and joined another like a large\nEnterprise help desk which is a totally\ndifferent Beast yeah um instead of like\ngetting to know everybody and like here\nI'm gonna install office for you it was\nall remote and it was for a large\nconstruction company and so I'd have\npeople call me\nfrom like these job sites and they're\ntrying to like this the wireless isn't\nworking in my trailer I'm like well\nwhere's your trailer it's like some\nremote place in Alaska and I'm remotely\ndebugging all this stuff um so I in\ntotal I probably did it for about three\nthree years or so before I moved into a\nsystems engineer role it sounds like it\nwas they were like pretty Hands-Onit's like this title\ntitle thinks uh maybe there's like\na little bit of a with like a reputation\nto it or something but you really don't\nknow what you're gonna get out of it\nlike you could you could end up\nscripting you could end up learning how\nto code you could end up like doing some\nCloud stuff like there's a lot of like\nactive directory stuff and identity\nstuff that I see with help desk related\nroles too and I mean it does suck that\nthey're notoriously underpaid but a lot\nof them also have\nlike uh uh like upskilling uh funds or\nlike maybe they'll pay for your shirts\nor they'll pay for your books or things\nlike that because I think a lot of\ncompanies that I've seen are pretty\nself-aware that they help this role is\none that people don't aspire to stay in\ntheir entire career uh and they like\nencourage people to like you know learn\nand upskill and get certification things\nlike that speak about certs do you have\nany have you taken any oh yeah I've\ntaken I've taken I mean I actually have\na good post uh search don't matter but\nthey absolutely do matter it's one of\nthem I think I saw that I think favorite\nquotes this was a while ago though yeah\nlike three years ago yeah\nhaven't been as consistent with blog\nyeah so I I don't know what I hold now\nI've let some of them expire but I you\nknow way back so I actually do have my a\nplus and N plus and I got grandfathered\nin so I have n Plus for life I don't\nhave to renew I took it the December\nthat they changed the policy where you\nhad to renew\num I passed my CCNA in 2013 I let that\nexpire a long time ago but that was\nthat was like horribly difficult for me\nI failed it three times uh finally made\nit through and then I've done some I've\ndid the AWS Cloud practitioner I've done\nuh the Azure sysadmin one and then the\ndevops 104 104 yeah uh and then the\ndevops one the 400 I think yeah that's a\ntough one when'd you take that\ntwo years ago so it's probably still\nvalid for a little while\nand you're and your time at Microsoft\ndid you oh my cat's here have you taken\nany nope\ndo you have any ones that you want to\ntake anytime soon I'm looking at the the\nGitHub once those seem like a really\ngood way yeah yeah stop why did this\nhappen like with workflows and actions\nlike probably a couple years ago I think\nnow\num but just to round out those skills\nthose those have been on my radar[Music]that would be a good one yeah given like\neverything that's going on oh come on\num\nyeah how do you feel about the a plus\nwas it was it useful it was so like my\nwhole degree program and computer\nnetworking was really to get me past\nthat certification so it was all set up\nfor it just gave me a really good\nfoundation\nI mean I even had a class on printers\nwhich I despised but I I had to work\nwith printers on the help desk so it was\nuseful\ndid um\nyou did a full four-year degree or was\nlike a just a two year yeah two years\nAssociates yep we uh we were talking\nabout school well because I tweeted\nabout wanting to go back to school and\nthen you mentioned like you had\nsimilar thoughts and I was curious to\nsee what like what do you think about it\nI've been touring with it ever since I\njoined Microsoft\num just to go back for computer science\nand finish it out so I got the two-year\ndegree and then I went and got a you\nknow got a job on the help desk and I\nstarted going to school and I finished\nabout I think I finished a year and a\nhalf like uh roughly uh a four-year\ndegree and then I just it became too\nmuch you know I was working two jobs and\ngoing to school and so something had to\ngive and school gave and it didn't\nreally have a negative impact on my\ncareer at that point\num but now like I'm seeing that there's\nsome holes that I could definitely fill\nespecially because I have a different\nmindset with school now than I did back\nthen where I think I would absorb a lot\nmore information and process it too\num but again the workload versus\nmy biggest contention with it is I'm\npretty sure I can learn faster without\nthe traditional track but I think I\nprobably learned it at a deeper level in\nthe traditional track knowing\nknowing what I know now about learning\num so that's my dilemma is but then all\nmy side stuff is going to suffer a\nlittle bit if I take on more workload\nfor school so I'm stalling the fence I'm\nnot decided but those are my that's my\nthought process yeah it's exactly I mean\nSuper similar where I'm like now I'm in\na position where I can afford it I I\ncould find the time if I wanted to and\nmost importantly I have the mindset and\nI don't have like because I feel like\nback when I was in school originally I\nwas just trying to figure out like what\nto do with my life like I gotta try all\nthese different things like how am I\ngonna like all that so all that kind of\ngets in your way and clouds it uh the\ndecision or like your ability to be in\nschool so now you know that I have kind\nof everything lined up and you know we\nget a pretty nice tuition reimbursement\nat Microsoft to I think I also I think\nmost importantly I have a maturity as\nwell to do something like school that I\ndidn't have back then right so but my\nproblems are the same and I'm like I'm\ngonna get bored I'm gonna like sit down\nin this English 101 thing because I\ndon't have any of the basics clear like\nI'm assuming like with your\nto your program you might have some of\nlike you know you have like writing or\ncommunication I had to do that actually\num when that first 18 months that I\ntalked about before\num that's when I had to do like\ncomposition and calculus so they just\nswitched the computer like the program\nto have not the teacher grade your math\nthe computer grade your math and I was\nlike this isn't fair like this my my\nwork doesn't matter like I just correct\nanswers\nso no that burned me out pretty quick\nbut I totally get it I wanna before we\nanswer questions on the checks I don't\nknow if you've seen these streams I\nusually just hang out and answer\nquestions that people give us in the\nchat I want to ask you about the SRE\nrole because I feel like it's it's\nsimilar to devops it has just like so\nmuch confusion around it it's like what\ndo you what do you actually do what do\nyou need to learn to get into it and is\nit like an entry-level friendly role so\ncurious about your thoughts on on that\nit's I would say it's definitely not an\nentry level role because depending on\nand it's going to be different depending\non the organization because it's very\nvery devopsy in the sense that the\nimplementation of esri is dependent on\nthat that company uh and so I can speak\nto my uh experience at stack and I think\nthey did a really good job implementing\nSRE but it's not entry level because it\nit's a inter it's a multi-discipline\nprofession or role where you need to\nknow about systems and infrastructure\nyou have to have at least a good\nscripting background and\na lot of like a lot of system\nadministration too and monitoring so\nlike like they have the whole teams\naround these different facets you know\nlike a couple jobs ago that we had a\nmonitoring team we had a Linux team we\nhad the windows team and SRE kind of\nexpects you to have a good\ngood amount of knowledge in a lot of\nthose\num what's really interesting about the\nSRE role though if you can if you can\nland one is everyone on the team is\ngoing to have a different t-shaped\nknowledge so like I had a really good\ninfrastructure as code background\nanother person had a really good\nmonitoring background but we all could\nkind of code and stuff like that\num\nyeah I guess what else would you like to\nknow about Test free role infrastructure\nas code\nand for you it was I think you're like a\nbig ansible guy right started with DSE\nand then it moved to like an official so\nI I actually started with CSE and\nPowershell because I was a purist with\nPowershell uh and then I wrote I wrote\nmy own\num DSC rapper and config management tool\nusing octopus deploy and then I wrote a\ncustom Powershell module called invoke\nDSC that abstracted DSE to Json\num and then I learned that there's value\nin a config management tool because I\njust tried to write it myself and I was\nlike I'm ever going to get underneath\nthis if this takes off of this company\nlike this is all I'm going to do is\nmanage this tool I created and I was\nlike we should just use an open source\ntool like ansible and that's how that\ncame to be so start with DSC but then\nansible on terraform yeah that sounds\nlike the mostinstead of like leveraging yeah it was a\nmistake I learned a lot but it was\ndefinitely a mistake\nso let's grab some comments from the\nchat now it's the last area you expect\nit is the last area you expect layoffs\nit's not a good indicator for the\neconomy curious if you have any thoughts\non layoffs and things like that I I so\nmy personal opinion is I think a lot of\npeople in the Panic through all\ncompanies off and it was a really weird\neconomic State and a lot of people over\nhired\num that's just my kind of observation\nwith it\num and I think it's also like we're in\nthis really interesting flux where we\nhaven't really seen this since like\nCloud came out where a lot of people are\npivoting the resources into this AI\nspace\num and I think those are the two biggest\nfactors for layoffs in my opinion but\nI'm I'm not in senior leadership and\nmanagement role in any capacity and I'm\nnot an economist so yeah you know take\nit with a grain of salt I think on top\nof that there's also like you know when\nyou have like the big companies doing it\nthen all the smaller the companies that\nare smaller compared to the large ones\nkind of have the cover like all right\nthey're doing it and then I can use the\nsame reasoning that they do even if the\nreasoning doesn't align\num so you're going to see a lot of\npeople take advantage of that because\nultimately business is business it sucks\nfor the people that you know get\naffected like all of us right because\nyou know even if we aren't laid off we\nlose team members or we lose people\npeople that we've worked with or stuff\nlike that and it sucks and it also like\nyou could be working on a project and\nthen the next day it's like oh you got\nto figure a bunch of new things out\nbecause everything kind of like shuffled\naround or something like that so there's\na lot more to like to it than\nthan what is just like publicly put out\nthere\num\nhold on here we go here's a good one is\nit true if you learn one cloud like gcp\nand other clouds like aw other clouds\nlike AWS and Azure are similar do you\nhave any other Cloud experience outside\nof azure AWS yeah okay was it\ndid you pick up azure\nfaster because you had AWS knowledge I I\nactually picked up Azure faster because\nI had Microsoft knowledge and it was\nbuilt in microsofty\num so what I will say though is it does\ngive you um it starts to build your\nmental model so I just finished right\nhere I just finished reading Peak\nand so it's a book about deliberate\npractice and one of the biggest\ntakeaways that I got from that book was\nthe importance of mental representation\nor mental models and understanding what\nthat is and so learning One Cloud will\nmake learning the other ones easy\nbecause you'll have context at least\nsome context and that they have\ndifferent names and you deploy them\ndifferently and they have different\nportals but essentially at the end of\nthe day if you learn them at a at even a\nsurface level you'll be able to connect\nmore dots because you have knowledge in\none area\nI agree I agree it's like a programming\nlanguage\nsomething like that let's see uh here we\ngo which area has more growth software\ndevelopment or Cloud admingood question yeah I think\nI don't necessarily think it's a\nquestion about growth it's more so I\nthink a lot of roles\nare going to significantly change and\nadapt because you know what AWS and\nAzure did to Data Centers and cloud is\nessentially what the technology is like\nopen AI uh oh Liam's here open Ai and\nhold on let me just add Liam before\nhey Liam\nhello\nJosh Leo I don't think so Liam no I\ndon't think so\nHello nice to meet you Liam is on my\nimmediate team so we're all we're\nRegional Advocates and Josh is on cloud\nwait what's your their Cloud native team\nCloud native open source yeahuh Steve morowski and Paul you and Aaron\nwhistling and George\nuh blanking on George's last name but\nGeorge but George cool\nis basically UK Liam do you want to do\nlike quick intro yeah so I'm based in UK\num at the Microsoft reactor like Ben\nsaid media colleagues so uh worked\nworked together it's brilliant Focus\nmostly on devops and go so I do a lot of\nmy stuff around there\num yeah this is pretty awesome actually\nit's got a really good team yeah Liam's\na big girl guy\ndon't talk anymorecome over and help support me so I'm the\ngo person on on our team but I'm\nsurrounded by Russ\nEngineers so\nbrilliant you guys need to connect for\nsure because Liam is doing a lot on\nefforts with like go on azure yeah so\nkeep me in mind yeah I definitely need a\nchat oh my Godwhat we were asking which area has more\ngrowth software development or cloud\ncloud admin Liam you got any thoughts\nhere oh\nI reckon Cloud admins growing quite\nquite quickly at the moment uh software\ndevelopment always finds quite saturated\nin terms of everyone's wanting to learn\neveryone's wanting to get into the tech\nindustry so it's like they immediately\ngo straight down by the software Dev\nroute not many people think about Cloud\nadmin and a lot of uh like the other\nroles that make up Tech\numI think um like to finish off my point\nit was saying like with what technology\nis like open AI and over Google\nlike that are just gonna bring in an\nabstraction to all that type of\ntechnology and obviously the easiest\nintegration is with Cloud so you have a\ncloud skill set it's kind of like you're\nalready closer to to integrating with\nall those types of apis so I think\nthere's there's a lot of potential there\nuh in my opinion\nLiam do you have a do you have a degree\ncollege degree I do I do it's in\ncomputer systems and networks so I don't\nactually use any of it in my day job I\nthink the closest I came to using it\num as a software engineer or as an\nadvocate was actually when when we did a\nseries back in almost probably about a\nyear ago now wasn't it the Azure v-net\nseries I think that was like the closest\nit came to actually using my degreeVMS you name it yeah that was good fun I\ndid like all the Cisco stuff so ccla one\ntwo three and four\num so they have like it's kind of like\nthe Azure certifications but Cisco ones\nuh it was it was hard it was it was\nreally hard because it was like physical\nswitches and I didn't really get to\ngrips with it never really\nloved it to begin with I just kind of\ndid it to get a degree open the door\nthat I needed to to get into what I was\ndoing at the time\ndo you have a any active certifications\nnow\nuh at the moment I've got oh God I think\nI don't think I've got any Azure ones\nactually I think I have I'm gonna say\nAWS ones\ndoes IBM have certs yeah I do uh well\nthey did yeah yeah I've got the IBM\nprofessional Cloud developer\ncertification I think I've got Google\ndigital marketing like sort of games\nlike a free thing I did which is pretty\nawesome uh yeah I've been got quite a\nfew that through\num\nit's not a claim there's another one\nthat there's like another certification\nboard\nclose to a claim\num so you can get them through\ncool do you have any any idea or like\nany any certs on your wishlist how do\nyou feel about certifications\noh it's a good question good question uh\nI think it is a double-edged sword\nbecause\nI I think on one hand they're really\nuseful to show that you can do your\nhomework and that you can learn stuff\nand answer some questions on it on the\nother hand I find it bad because it's\nit's so saturated in terms of there's so\nmany certifications you can do\nand they don't really amount to much in\nmy mind which is why I kind of stopped\npushing them really heavily and didn't\nreally do them myself I felt like I\ncould be much more rounded if I went\nthrough learn modules or learned like a\nproper tutorial to learn a proper\ntechnology as opposed to going down like\nthis siled here's everything to know\nlike everything you need to learn to\nknow this one thing and then just kind\nof embrace the whole Tech stack\num more so openly if that made sense\nyeah more a fan of like Hands-On\nHands-On yeah I get you I think this is\nrelated to let's see when debating on a\ndegree we're taking the same\ncertifications that cover the topic from\nTraditional School hold the same value\nno piece of paper but the same knowledge\nis gained thoughts\noh but it's that it's\nit's unfortunately that piece of paper\nthat holds the value right\nlike I mean that's the benefit of going\nto school yeah I I think having my\ndegree was the only thing that opened\nthe door to getting a graduate job\num at the time so what about four ish\nyears ago when I started well when I\ngraduated in 2018 most of the jobs that\nI applying for for grad schemes what\nwhat you needed to have a degree piece\nof paper in your hand and it had to be\nof a certain level and in the UK I'm not\nsure what it's like in the US but over\nin the UK we obviously have first or\nupper class up a second and then lower\nsecond and a third and they they always\nask for nothing less than a 2-1 which is\nanother second class you'd get the odd\none which was like a two two so a lower\nsecond class but most of me just opened\nthat door\num school is that for\neigncourse so I did a placement year as a\nsoftware developer\nso\nand so job jobs there in the UK it's\nlike if you don't have one you're it's\nlike just really tough to break into\nyeah I mean it was four years ago I'm\nnot gonna be honest with you I haven't\nreally looked recently\nuh but it's it's certainly helping to\nMentor younger people that are coming\nthrough like sick form so you know like\ncollege or end of high school basically\nuh going into sort of graduate roles\nstill a lot of them I see are asking for\ndegrees of certain levels\nbut that just runs true when it's not an\napprenticeship so in the UK we have the\na lot of apprenticeships that are going\non um where you can just finish call to\n18 and then jump straight into a job but\nyou get paid for it and then alongside\nthat you also do like a\ndegree which you get paid for so you're\nkind of going to University getting paid\nand getting hands-on experience at the\nsame time which is a really cool way to\ndo it but then the barriers to entry is\nso high only like so many people can get\ninto that kind of role and then it's you\neither divert off to a different path or\nyou end up going to University which\ncollege yeah so it's like it's really\nit's really hard question to answer yeah\nyeah because again no one path is like\neasier let me let me introduce\neveryone's all right so hold on so for\nthe chat as well\nuh Richard wait never ships on the side\nrishab to Bishop and Liam do you know\neach other I feel like you might know\neach other no are they even met like\nonce once yeah are you muted yourself\nplease talk no you're muted\nI can't hear you uh can you hear me\nanyway yes okay right now okay okay\nuh devops python space devrel at twilio\nLiam go\ndevops space\nuh devrel at Microsoft Josh Josh what's\nyour main program language\ngo right now is the is the main language\nthat I'm working go is 50 so go\ngo in Cloud native at Microsoft and then\nthere'sthen there's you talk about but yeah\nRichard Josh Josh Williamokay cool uh let's see here which Aryan\nTech has will have more resistance to\nlayoffs Cloud cyber security mlI don't think I don't think you could\nreally see it as like which area or like\nwhich like Focus\nno I've certainly seen that there's\nliterally no Synergy across it so I've\nseen people from so many different sort\nof areas being affected by this uh\nwhether it's in machine learning on AI\num all the way across to like hololens\nand VR for example so a lot of a lot of\nthose teams have been laid off which you\nthink is upcoming Tech right you think\nthose are like the Pinnacle of what we'd\nbe wanting to aim for and I don't know I\ndon't think anybody's safe from it it's\nfelt a bit like a game of Battleship\nand I have no idea\nit's gonna get\nyeah trying to like guess it or or\ntry to make yourself feel more safe than\nothers it's like nah\nyou're just asking for frustration and\nstress that way yeah because there's\nlike no no guarantee there that's a\nquestion uh I'm just starting out in\nclouds so which one of these roles are\nthe more safe and Cloud architect\nengineer networking or devops okay so I\nguess we kind of answered this because\nthere's no such thing as a safe\nas they say for all but uh in this panel\nI would say\num the one that you most enjoy because\nyou're going to put more into it and\nbecome better at it that would be my\nkind of two cents there is like which of\nthose brackets do you would like pulls\nyou forward and wants makes you want to\ninvest in it more because the one that\nyou invest in more is going to be the\nsafest one\num yeah at least like sharpening your\nskill sets and being really good at that\nparticular discipline\nthink so yeah because then you can also\nlike give your full you know\nwhatever potential you have or even more\num because you're really passionate in\nthat specific area\num because they really covered a lot so\nCloud there's architect there's engineer\nthere's networking and devops\nyeah it's very wide like yeah\nit's like like a lot of different things\nthat you could potentially get into well\na good story uh Liam and I both\nmentioned like we we started with\ncomputer networking and we did it like I\npassed a cc and I didn't go for four\nyears agree so you got more grit than I\ndo in that area for sure but I did do\nthe CCNA and it took me about you know\ntwo years to get that passes and that\nand after I passed that I was like I'm\npivoting go I'm going the script and\nRoute I'm not I'm not doing networking\nso that was a good move for me relate to\nthat so it's funny\num I feel like we're meeting for the\nfirst time Josh I've seen some work uh\nand I'm really excited to see The Bash\nuh stuff\nbut I've also went to like Community\nCollege because of just how much money\nwas involved at that time to get a\ndegree\num and I did the computer networking\nand one of our professors introduced us\nto like CCNA and he's like this is the\nlike the you know signature set that you\nget if you want to be a network engineer\nat a local company or University or\nwhatever wherever you want to work and I\nsaw the book I read the first chapter\nand I'm like no\nit is something it is a wedge it's a\ndoor stop that book you know what you\nknow what I did so I I passed a cert the\nnext day I took both my cset and CCNA\nbooks and I gave them to Goodwilluh yeah that's a it's a no joke\ncertification those ones those are like\nthere are some solid work you've got to\nput in for them they're hard\nyeah I think the right the the dive so\ndeep into like the concepts uh\nspecifically like when it comes to you\nknow Cisco hardware and I'm like I don't\nknow if this is being taught to us at\nschool so it'll be really hard to you\nknow just self-learn and at that time\nlike you know I think I made some\nstupid decisions which you know like\nshe could have avoided but yeah career\nsome of it's necessary pain though like\nI don't regret it because now on the off\nchance the chance that I'm in the I'm\ndoing something in the cloud and I run\ninto this networking issue I'm not\ncompletely blind like I knew several\nprincipal level software Engineers that\nlike they'd reach the network layer and\njust throw up their hands I think yeah\nthese are brilliant people and they just\nthrow up their hands and be like oh so\nthat works fault it's like the only\nthing that changed here is your code\nbase\nyes but it's a network\nthere's also some like I I've talked to\na few folks and I see some kind of\nhate\nI don't know why towards networking and\nlike how like majority of people hate it\njust like you know it's so boring\nit's not it's it's hard but it's it's\nnot boring because when you once you\nlike dive I guess it could also be the\neducation because you know yeah maybe\nyeah like in in that it can be driving\nthat's for sure there we go that's the\nword not boring okay\nbut yeah\nyeah it was fascinating to know that um\nyou also started in help desk which is\ngood\nkind of share like really similar pads\nsorry go ahead and go ahead\nit's up to us now to make some fun\nnetworking and educational content\nnetworking for beginners who's going to\ndo that someone should totally do that\nthat's a great idea I'll go it will be\nintroduction yeah that's exactlysomething slightly beneath an associate\nlevel knowledge is more than enough to\nget into Cloud yeah\ntotally totally all right question Cloud\nengineering specifically Azure searching\nfor jobs which is a bigger impact\nPowershell or bash Josh\nif you're working in Azure Powershell\num because that's what azure's really\nbuilt built with and that's the glue but\nif you're going to move into the cloud\nnative space like so I'm a huge\nPowershell background I've got uh you\ncan't see it in the angle but I had MVP\nbefore I joined Microsoft and it was\nprimarily in my work in that space so I\nI'm a huge fan of that language if\nyou're on earlier I was a Powershell\npurist for a while and didn't even want\nto use a config management tool\num but when you move into the the cloud\nnative space and you start to do things\nwith containers and kubernetes and stuff\nlike you're not going to escape bash uh\nso like if you're just starting in Azure\nand you're more doing the Cloud\nengineering and admin stuff I'd say\npowershells you're better bet there to\nstart\num but just know like in the back your\nmind like you're not gonna completely\navoid Bash\nbut what if you're a what if you're a a\ncloud admin for Azure but using Linux\nservers\nI still think all the services though\nthey have well there's the Azure CLI so\nyou'd probably be okay if you want to\nstay in that same domain\num but there is a lot of a lot of things\nwith power so you could do just because\nit's running on Azure\num unless you need to go to the OS level\nso at the service level like you want to\ninteract with Services it'd be\nPowershell but then if you drop to the\nOS it you'd have your bash but probably\nuse classic platform or cross-platform\nyeah do you yeah I was going to say do\nyou feel like Powershell is you know\nmore closed whereas bash is like\nespecially with the cloud native space\nyou know that's like the staple\num and\nI I think it's probably just because\nlike bash is there and yeah it's it it's\npainful to put it like so good examples\nlike GitHub Runners right like where\nyour action runs like if you're just\nusing a container image if you want to\nbash is there you don't have to worry\nabout it and shim in Powershell so\nyou're just going to run into a lot of\ncases like that where yes you could\nshove Powershell in there but it's just\ngoing to be easier to use bash universal\nlanguage yeah that's more open I guess\nI love networking but I'm doing CCNA is\nit worth taking exam for cloud or notyeah I think so I I think you can't go\nwrong\nbecause you're always going to need\nnetworking experience in Cloud if you're\ndoing any kind of orchestration take\nkubernetes for example right or I don't\nknow istio so service Mash you're going\nto need to know how to network you're\ngoing to need to know the protocols\nyou're going to need to know your\ndifferent OSI levels right you just it's\nkind of a fundamental skill to know in\nCloud especially if you're going to go\ndown that route if you're a software\nengineer it's good to know about the\ndifferent layers of programming well\nwhen you're sort of interacting with\ndifferent network protocols but if\nyou're going for cloud I think\nnetworking is a fundamental skill that\nyou should at least know about or at\nleast have some sort of in-depth\nknowledge on that's a good question oh\nsorry go ahead sorry I was going to say\nyeah but is it worth it to get a CCNA\nand like I I I totally you know agree\nwith all the concepts you need to know\nthe OSI layers you need to know how the\nthree-way handshake happens how\ncomputers communicate with each other\nwhat's the difference between TCP udb\nbut is it worth\ngoing deep into you know what's the CCNA\nseason A1 doesn't go too deep it's quite\nintroductory at networking level so if\nyou're going to go for CCNA those four\nexams or at least when I did that was\nFour Season I one two three and four if\nyou're going for like the whole shebang\ndown to level like c74 that's when you\nstart looking at different packets\nyou're intercepting sort of headers and\nreading data from that kind of minute\nlevel but ccna1 is very much an overview\nof networking what is it why is it how\ndo you use it and what's the difference\nis that still called csap or is that not\nit's been like it it's been quite a\nwhile it's been about four years for me\nthere's also the network plus too from\nCompTIA uh yeah is that one\nyeah it used to be like a equivalent to\nwhatever AZ 900 is to networking is\nthere something like that but no it's\nnot as introductory as because there is\nAZ 700\nbut I feel like people go with CCNA or\nnetwork plus because they're Cloud\nagnostic and you learn about networking\nrather than sticking to like a vendor\nright because AWS has their own flavor\nof a networking sort\nAzure has one I don't think TCP has one\nyet\nbut it's Cisco\nbut it's like Cisco like is Cisco and\nnetworking essentially like the same\nthing now I think what Liam was saying\nwith the CCNA one I think it's more\nabout the concepts and networking and\nnot like the switches and routers and\nstuff yeah yeah it's kind of like the\nfun the fundamentals right yeah\nhere's a good question should I learn\nbash script or shell script please tell\nme I'm very confused Josh this is like\nvideo number two yeah that you coveredso if anybody else\num has any more detailed knowledge let\nme know but they're essentially the same\nthing\num so bash so there's a little bit of a\ndifference when we say terminal people\ninterject that so there's the terminal\nand that's a terminal emulator that's\nwhat you issue commands and then you\nhave your shell and that shell can be\nbash or Powershell\num that's inside of the terminal and so\nif you're\nlike bash and and shell script those are\nsynonymous like if you go in vs code\nthere isn't actually a bash syntax\nthere's a shell syntax and it's actually\nmeaning bash for the syntax of that the\nparticular shell\num so that I guess I would say learn\nbash\num because that would be like what we\nwould call the Shell they just call\nShell as like a general agnostic term\nfor whatever command line interface\nyou're interacting with so shell could\nalso be command line it could be\nPowershell or it could be bash but it\ngets confusing when you don't know those\nmore detailed terminologies\num like I got laid into pretty good when\nI wrote a Powershell post on Azure\nPowershell and they had a really good\npoint where like I needed to separate\nout terminal from Powershell from the AZ\nmodule right like those are all three\nseparate things that we often say as\nshell uh so it gets very confusing I can\ntotally understand like I can understand\nthe confusion\nyou know I used to see people giving\nexample of you know how in the script\nyou put bin bash at the top\nso that just tells you this is a bad\nscript and that's how you differentiate\nbetween like our professor used to give\nus that example because we would be\nconfused in the beginning like is the\nterminal itself the entire Bash\nyeah because you could also be in like\nlike today I was in seashell but I had a\nscript with the shebang had been bashed\nand it runs in bash even though you're\nrunning it from somewhere else yeah this\nis a whole different whole world over\nhere learn Bash that's the lesson of the\nweek\num I think they call it like shell\nscript because you could like bash\num you can have a script that doesn't\nhave any bash in it yes so and so it\ncould just be running a grep command and\nthat's that's a shell script\num but it's all being executed typically\nfrom bash\num in a lot of cases unless you're using\nanother shell like when just mentioned\ncool\num well the chat gives us more questions\nwhat's everyone working on what's\neveryone been up to this week wants to\nstart rishab rishab you were at sibo how\nwas that yeah so\num that was good\num great weather I hate to be back\nbecause it's snowing right now and is\nminus something degrees Celsius what uh\nwhat part of Florida was it Tampa Tampa\nso it was like 23 degrees Celsius great\nweather Great like cool uh breezes and\num there was the river so the venue was\nreally close to the Bay\num yeah it was fun the talk went really\ngood networked with a lot of the cloud\nnative\ncommunity members that what they're\npresenting on you know kubernetes in the\ncloud native space service mesh learned\na lot about containerization over those\ntwo days and yep um just got back\nyesterday\num so yesterday was catching up\num with work and today the same\nemails\nnicethis week\ntraveler I was I was away yeah\nI I took some time off I went to Dubai I\nalways just I that's the one place I\nalways go to\num\nyeah yeah it pretty much was I was at\nwork last week that's like a once in a\nlifetime thing for people in the states\nyeah\nI was gonna say that pretty lucky it's\nnot it's like an eight hour flight seven\nhour flight from here so it's not too\nbad\num yeah I was I was away on holiday for\na little bit came back but um yeah I've\nbeen working on a\nkind of a big project which happening in\nMarch so I'm building like a three-tier\napplication three hour live stream that\nI'm doing with somebody in the community\nhere in Microsoft UK so we're recording\nit as a recording we're doing a live\nstream in the Microsoft Studios so it's\ngonna be like TV production all that\nkind of level stuff which is going to be\nreally cool all about the internals of\ngo what it is and how to get started\nwith the Integrations on Azure so\nlooking forward to doing that to be\nhonest with you it's going to be really\nfun\nhere's a question for for you Josh and\nLiam how good is and I want you to be\nhonest because this isn't an official\nMicrosoft Channel this is my channel how\ngood is support for go on azure\ncrap\noh this is as honest he can be I love it\nyeah no bueno but I know a good team\nthat's trying to make it better there he\ngoes\nyeah\nyour media train Josh yeah I worked\nactually so I was just honest uh lead\ntechnical writer for go on Azure at my\nprevious role\num and so it was painful\num but I got to know the SDK team there\nand they're they're doing good work\nthere but a lot of the services it's\nit's not it's second class\nis it is it because there's there's less\nlike adoption for it so is it like like\na vicious circle like less well you\nthink go and you think Google you know\nand so like goes embedded in all their\ndocumentation and stuff and it's just\nnot you know you think Azure\nyouthink.net and that's kind of where it\nis and I think that's FL battle probably\nwhat Liam's I'm kind of alluding to\nvery much so I I mean if you look at the\ncompetition uh across different Cloud\nproviders it's\nit's lagged it's lagged quite a bit\num the teams are doing a great job\npushing I think that was in one of the\nchannels at work where someone was\nasking if they're sort of making a\nserverless function like a native\nserverless function for the build pack\nit's the moment I think if you want to\nAzure use serverless functions uh with\ngo you have to use HTTP sort of server\nessentially like\nyeah custom Handler so it's\nit's difficult because you can't get a\nlot of things you want to get done\nquickly\num that you should be able to get done\nquickly so yeah the teams behind it are\nbrilliant they're pushing it but in\nterms of I guess business impact it's\ngoing to be hard to justify\njustify it in terms of what we're doing\nright it's not it's not I guess what we\nwant to do we've got to be careful I say\nbut it's uh\nyeah there's different different\napproaches for it yeah until I get it\nJosh what have you been up to this week\nuh this week was the third week of the\ncloud native New Year that we kicked off\nit's a little event that my team put\ntogether\num or was helping put together and so we\nI just got off a live stream like right\nbefore this um\nyeah it's like I'm ready let's just\nextend this\nI find it kind of funny how ready\neveryone in advocacy I mean the majority\nof people are advocacy advocacy are\nready to just jump on a live stream it's\nbecause we do it like so much dude Josh\ndo you do how and your team how often\nare you on like live uh last week was\nour first live stream so this is my\nthird third appearance in a live stream\num for Microsoft for you know related\nif you ever want to practice just come\non here like that sounds good to me Liam\nand I would do these like what every day\nyeah it's a weekly appearance yeah\nyeah it was Liam before joining\nMicrosoft were you doing like last like\nlive stream stuff often no no before I\njoined uh Microsoft there was a lot of\nvideo on demand so I used to work at IBM\nprior to this as an advocate and the\nlead advocate for UK so it's very much\nbid on demand working with different\nteams across IBM more of like an\ninternal role at some point throughout\nthe pandemic it's hard to Pivot uh to\nbegin with during the pandemic because\nwe're so used to just traveling\neverywhere so it used to help run\num these meetup groups across the UK so\nwe had IBM code London we had code I\nthink it's Bristol and Scotland so for\nthose of you know like the UK Anatomy\nthat's kind of like quite from the\nbottom to the top\num and we used to travel and do a lot of\nevents throughout that and obviously\nconferences so it's like heavy on travel\nso there wasn't really much live\nstreaming in it to be honest with you\nand then it was like jump to Microsoft\ndid a similar role and it was all like\nall of it a lot of digital scale a lot\nof virtual so kind of picked up a lot of\nthe live stream I never used to be I\nwould like I was never comfortable on\ncamera prior to being at Microsoft doing\nthis it was all very much standing on\nstage in front of people kind of\nconfidence as opposed to sitting down\nand sort of having to control I'm still\nafraid that I learned like the horrified\nauthor\npresence you know and be more relaxed\nbecause like that's all that I've done\nfor video content more or less is just\nyou know like very polished video\ncontent and so I'm trying to let that go\nand relax a bit\nuh if that I guess the hardest bit for\nme was just not being able to read a\nroom so I remember doing my first online\nconference and sort of talking into a\ncamera and talking into a microphone and\nit was just silent like nobody was\nspeaking back to you that's very odd\nthat was always very odd to begin with\nuh I lost it now but uh yeah it's hard\nwe have a chat now how people in the\nchat let us know\nhow are you feeling what's the what's\nthe vibe right now uh it's like yeah\nit's different I've never done any\nin per I mean I've done some of like\nreactor stuff but it's more so like\ncareer networking type of thing but I've\nnever done like technical talks at\nconferences but I also don't have much\nof an interest\nI don't know why I also don't have much\nof an interest to like travel to do that\nstuff either though Liam I know you do\nthat a lot I don't know if Josh do you\nhave experience doing I've done a couple\nso I poked I I've spoken a lot of like\nuser groups like locally\num years ago before the pandemic and\nthen I spoke at the Powershell and\ndevops Summit at one time in 2018.\num so I've done a little bit but I'm\nI'm pretty rutted I've got you know two\nlittle kids so travel's a little bit\nharderBishop you've been doing\nsome for a while right\nyeah I think last year has been like it\ncaught up\num especially with with you know back in\nperson events and then I also realized\nthere's this whole world of submitting\nlike you know cfps and stuff like I I to\nuntil last year I didn't know you could\njust randomly submit cfps to certain\nTech events I'm like they'd reach out to\nthe speakers and get that organized but\nyeah just just getting to know that but\nthen I I agree with like Liam that there\nis always this aspect of being in person\nbecause you know you can tell by if if\nothers are listening and like paying\nattention and that's how I used to make\nlike eye contact especially when\nspeaking in person whereas like now\nwe're I guess it's different story\nbecause we are for here so I can talk to\nyou right but then if you do that alone\nthere's just chat and you don't know\nlike you solo streaming terrifies me\nI'll be honest really yeah\nand I guess it I mean maybe it depends\nlike the topic so the only stream that I\nfelt intimidated was the one that I did\nuh the hell Linux Works which I did on\nWednesday because there was the Linux\nCommunity I don't know if you all know\nabout this but they will if you say\nanything wrong they will finish you so I\nhad people in there was like it's not\ncalled Linux it's called uh what is it\ngnu Linux it's like oh you're saying\nthis wrong like how what do you mean\nlike this oh so I have people like that\nbut it was also like probably one of the\nno the most attentive live stream that\nI've done and so the chat was going by\nso fast I was at one point I was like\nI'm just not gonna care about this\nbut then I found that most people are\npretty pretty chill like this person\nsays they're having a good time so it's\npretty awesome we have a\nquestion here which study strategy do\nyou think you think is most efficient\nJosh is a big fan of study strategies\nstudying for the AWS Solutions Arctic\ncert and I wonder how many people are\nable to write the exam in like a month\ndoes anyone have this certificationokay yeah I have\ndo you want to speak to your study\nstrategy or okay let's let's let's make\nthis a higher levelcertification study strategy would love\nto hear what you guys schedule it that's\nthe first thing schedule it put it in\nyou can push it a little bit if you want\nbut I'd say like 30 to 60 days but go\nahead\nsorry I was gonna say only if you have a\ntime limit\nyeah I've done so it's where I didn't\ncare if I passed them in six months or\none month so I don't book them but yeah\nif there is a hot goal that you need a\ncertificate for like career stuff and\nlike you know promotions or anything and\nyou want to do it in a month yeah\nschedule it because\nyeah you'll have a deadline to be uh to\nmeet basically\nbut that's a great tip\nthat's what took me so long to get the\nccnas I would like study super super\nhard and then I get burned out and then\nI wouldn't study for a week and so I\njust constantly reset my studying I see\nuh and it's because I didn't schedule it\nbecause I didn't have this time pressure\nlike I can't take a week off because I\nhave it's scheduled for two weeks or a\nmonth or whatever so that really bit me\nin the past\nthe only sorry go ahead I was going to\nask because you said it took you like\ntwo years to pass that yeah but that was\nbecause you were taking breaks yep and\nresetting and well then I would take\nlike the CCNA and then I'd fail and get\ndiscouraged and like take a month off\nyou know okay so if you put it all\ntogether with like removing the brakes\nhow much time do you think it really\nlike how much like deep focus study time\ndo you think it took I probably could\nhave done it in three to four months\nokay okay it's a lot more doable now\nbecause I was thinking two years there's\nno way I've ever taken the certification\nyeah but that is a lot more doable\nyeah the the only reason I have that\nkind of opinion or perspective is so\nespecially for the solutions architect I\nonly studied for like two weeks because\nI was working as a cloud engineer for\none and a half years and strictly in AWS\nso I think that the question is like\nreally you know subjective to each and\nevery one yeah and and with Solutions\narchitect just booked it like a day\nbefore went in and gave the exam really\nyeah how many weeks of studying two\nweeks two weeks plus over a year of\nexperience\nalmost yeah more than a year yeah yeah I\nfeel like that's pretty appropriate\nI guess it also depends on yeah your\ncurrent experience let me see studying\nfor the AWS\nexam I think a month\nis reasonable from scratch though no no\nthat's tough\nyes for a Solutions architect yes\nit took me developer when it took me six\nmonths to study and pass for that but\nthat was from scratch right yeah from\nscratch like yeah no knowledge\nwhatsoever but then when I took like the\n900 I\nI did that in like the afternoon with\nbut like yeah same approach yeah Azure\nexperience yeah all right what else we\ngot here\nto use any note who here uses notion I\nuse notion Liam do you use notion no\nJosh I know you I've used it I don't use\nit no it's not that I'm not a fan uh\njust different tools okay do you use any\nnotion templates for your studies or you\ncreated your own worship do you have\ntemplates for your studies\nno it's just like simple like you know\nthe page template and then you just\nstart putting stuff in\num I was gonna ask does any of you use\nobsidian because I've been hearing about\nthat a lot yeah\nJosh he's a big fan maybe\nwhat do you use they're like how do you\nlike write down notes or whatever flash\ncards I I just simply use flashcards\nit's always worked for me yeah it's\nalways worked for me so I like so I go\nthrough everything in a notepad\num so literally something okay on my\ndesk so literally just just a small A5\nnotepad cram everything I can done like\none page and then I'll just condense\nthat into like a little flash card\num I'll go through some practice exam\ntest questions I'll write them on the\nback and they'll be like very similar\nvery much like if you're at school you\nwent through all the like past papers\nright they're all very similar and the\nquestions don't really deviate too much\nas most of the context\num so I'd always just do it that way\nI've just totally old school I was\nliterally about to buy an iPad this\nweekend just so I can try something\ndifferent in terms of like taking notes\non an iPad as opposed to physical pen\nand paper\num so I was going to try and mix it up\nthis weekend actually I tweeted about it\nI think it was like yesterday before\nasking people like how do they do this\nhow do they use an iPad because I see so\nmany like pictures of setups with people\nwith iPads and I had like pencils and\nstuff and wondering how they find it so\nthat's kind of totally old school\ntotally awesome\nI find it like a nice toy but I find\nthat the iPad gets in the way the\nmajority of the time because I'm either\nlike writing stuff down like on like I\nuse journals as well like straight but\nlike no structure like absolutely like\noh like these random words where I go\nback to it later on I'm like what the\nhell did I write down here or I'm using\nvery structured like typing stuff out on\nnotion because I'm like referencing some\nsort of material that's somewhere like\nthere's no in between so I feel like\nwith the iPad I'm like I gotta pull it\nout I got the pen so I gotta open it up\nhandwriting but then I'm like this\ndoesn't feel the same as paper so then I\nswitched the paper and then I never end\nup using like I can see it cool for like\ndiagramming but then what I end up using\nfor diagramming is scally draw which is\njust way more easier and straightforward\nto use than once you get a hang of what\nyou're actually doing and it looks\ndecent with like less effort but I feel\nlike the iPad apps take more effort for\nit to look decent if that makes sense\nyeah no I think\nabsolutely\ngoing through so many no padsuh yeah I've got like a whole box like\nstacked full of them I've got lots of\nthem so many pretty same here yeah yeah\nI was gonna say with their iPad thingy I\nwent even down the rabbit hole of like\nhow Gwen said it doesn't feel like paper\nand got that paper like you know screen\nthings like does that make it better a\nlittle to some extent you have like some\nkind of friction that makes it feel like\npaper but then as you said there is just\ntoo much on an iPad and I'm like so I\njust gave it to like my wife and she\nloves it dude I did the same I gave it\nto\nback to school I'm like here I have this\nexactly yeah she she has night school so\nshe takes it instead of the like her\nlaptop so it's way easier for her but\nyeah if you want to do a deep dive on I\nso I I did like eight months like heads\ndown okay note taking Shenanigans\num so if we want like that's a whole\nlike for eight hour conversation yeah\nwhat were you trying to figure out what\nworks best for you uh well my main goal\nwas to uh I was writing a non-fiction\nbook at the time and so I wanted a way\nto like that that dream that the note\ntaking system is supposed to give you\nyour manuscripts your rough drafts right\nso I tried to figure that out but then I\nalso tried to apply it in like the\ntechnical World sense and learned like I\nstarted to skill up and go at that same\ntime and so I was just consuming and\nprocessing a ton of information uh with\nresearch and I wanted a way to capture\nit and I learned a lot of it you know\neventually like I stopped for a while\nand stuff but uh back to your point\nabout uh obsidian I did write a book\nabout how to like how to apply the smart\nnotes methodology in obsidian and I\ndidn't know this but it's apparently on\nGoodreads which is pretty cool I didn't\nknow that to like just just now I\nGoogled it to try to get you a link and\nit showed up there so that's that's\nsuper cool but yeah if we want to have\nlike a live stream on note taking I can\nI can go pretty deep into into that\nbecause I've been around every tool I'll\njust drop it in the chat people love\nnote-taking systems like just knowing\nabout it\nI don't know why yeah because I think it\ngives you the sense of like productivity\nlike watching other people do it yeah\nI've I've once searched something about\nnotion and then you know how YouTube is\nyou're down the rabbit hole off all\nthese aesthetically pleasing videos of\nnote-taking and I'm like this is a whole\nRabbit Hole yeah I just gave up on it\nswitching\nsunsets here do any of you have\nexperience with Microsoft Sentinel do\nany of you have experience with thisI've only heard a pitch about it\nat my past like\nprevious to previous employer we were\ntrying to\ndo some Enterprises stuff and there was\nsome concerns that caused to have that\ndiscussionthe remarkable is pretty cool feels like\nwriting on paper no distraction of other\napps and can sync to the cloud convert\nto text what is that remarkable it's uh\nwe'll go ahead\nno no go ahead it's it's basically like\na a digital display with an ink display\nuh notepad so they try to get it as\nclose to paper as possible\num I've not tried it it's been very\ntempting but I I did the same iPad route\nI was kind of just like laughing in my\nhead as everybody talked about it\nbecause I got a mini for the same reason\njust specifically for notes and it was\nand I got the paper thing on top and I\ngot the pencil and I did all that and\nthen this remarkable comes out and I'm\nlike\nI probably should have just done that\nbecause the iPad just has everything\nelse on it and so it's it's a mess you\ncan't just yeah it's just yeah so yeah\nso it's like a notebook you could say\nbut everything just sinks to the cloud\nso some people swear to buy it yeah I've\nnot tried it\nI feel like people will swear by\nanything though\nespecially on Twitter people that I\nwould I respect their opinion okay um\nyeah they are just BS and kind of swear\nby it um but yeah it was I think I've\nwatched Scott hanselman's video on this\ntoo again video\non I'm not sure if it was on Twitter or\nlike I don't think it's on YouTube\num but back in The Tick Tock yeah\nhe has a video on the new one I think\nthey came out with remarkable too nowthank you\noh did he freeze\nI think so\ndid you freeze for you guys yeah yeah\nit's not just me\nuh cool so let's see I think we got\nsomeone said here good question I wanted\nthis bash or bash group for beginners I\nthink they might be a little confused on\ndifferent words well uh maybe they were\ntalking about like just learning bash\ncommands versus like diving into\nscripting\num and the series kind of talks about\nthat I would definitely start with the\ncommands like just getting familiar or\nnavigating and using using bash in the\nterminal to do things and then naturally\nan extension of that will be hey I want\nto repeat this and you throw it in a\nscript and you start to learn the\nscripting language yeah it's a pretty\nnot yeah like natural uh\nlike Journey that way\nbecause you're not gonna you know after\nyou write maybe like a line of commands\na line or two then you're gonna be like\nlet me just put this\nfile it's like too much Liam what's your\nexperience with scripting in general\nuh\nminimal so I did quite a lot of it\nactually at IBM and I was working on\num so Cloud integration systems at IBM\nwith containers and hybrid between local\ndevelopment and remote development and\nsort of tying together so I had a lot of\nbash script in there but since then I\nhaven't really touched its balance with\nyou there was a lot of um sorry devopsy\nstuff that were that we were doing\num honestly I haven't touched it in\nabout two or three years properly so I\nwas really excited when you were doing a\nbash for beginners course right so when\nI saw that coming out and I was like I'm\ngonna be watching this one this is on my\nwatch list\nso yeah I gotta be watching that yeah\na few more days and we're\nalmost like oh I thinkI'm building a project from the ground\nup at Microsoft I'm sure you all can\nrelate to this but it's like yeah\nit is\nI told Justin Justin is our Liam and I\nas our manager I told him this week like\nI felt every time I was talking about\nthis project to get someone's support\nlike I was on Shark Tank you know how\nShark Tank you have to do like a pitch\nand then you have to like really\nconvince them like oh we can accomplish\nThis Together kind of thing I put every\nsingle I have so many of those\nconversations right now but now you know\na couple months after I'm like oh my\ngoodness the next time I go into doing\nsomething like this I'm gonna make it so\nmuch better it's gonna be so much more\nefficient because I have an idea but you\nreally do have to like I think that's\nwhat is one of the benefits of working\non such a large company is like there\nreally is everything and anything you\nwant available but you have to go and\nfind it you have to go and see who's the\nbest fit who aligns with the most and\nthere's there could be like multiple\noptions for that too\num but it's cool because you don't have\nto essentially become an expert or delve\ninto everything on your own like you\njust gotta go connect those people and\nlike network with the right with the\nright people I don't know if you guys\nhave had that kind of I'm learning that\nright now actually that's the exact\nJourney that I'm on because I'm used to\nlike having the context of everything\nand coming up with the projects or\nhaving the ability to cop out of that\nresponsibility in that autonomy and be\nlike here's a ticket I can solve you\nknow oh yeah we were we were talking\nabout that such a different\nticketwhere this is like you gotta bring all\nof it like the idea come about like oh I\nwant to do this thing I spoke to Justin\nhe's like all right go go figure it out\nkind of like and then\nrecruit people yeah you have to write\nyour one pager you have to outline\nrecruit the right people all these types\nof things\nand yeah it was definitely like I don't\nknow it was cool it was definitely very\nsometimes\nit also helped me understand that I\ndefinitely do not want to be a manager\ndefinitely do not want to be a manager\ndo any of you have manager experience or\nor want to uh I've had the lead\nexperience but not in that like managed\npeople manager yeahdo you is that like a career goal for\nany of you\nprobably at one point at one point I\nthink yes for me but at the moment no I\nmean in large corporates in big\ncompanies it's it's difficult right when\nyou're up with so many different people\nyou've gotta but especially with remote\nteams I guess it's hard with no teams I\nalways ask Justin how he kind of manages\nlike you said teaser manager right and\nour team is spread across the world I\nthink I've asked so many times how do\nyou manage a team that is so globally\ndistributed and it's hard because in a\nworld today with everybody in so many\ndifferent locations it is going to be\ndifficult and whether I've got the grit\nfor that whether it's someone I want to\ngo down\nmaybe maybe not\nyeah I'm the kind of same not anytime\nsoon and even later maybe like\nI don't know I it I don't know I just\nfeel like I would feel responsible for\nso many people's careers and that's like\ntough It's like a tough position to put\nyourself in it is in my opinion because\nyou want to be a great manager it's\nhands off as well right so so you're\nvery much a people manager at that point\nyou're not necessarily doing a lot of\nthe tech stuff which is what I found or\nwhat I would find quite difficult I\nthink because I like being hands on I\nlike being relevant with what's going on\nI like playing with the tech\nit's hot enough like dealing with admin\nas it is as an advocate and doing slides\nand sort of talking to people and\nnetworking all that kind of stuff on top\nof keep on top of your Tech and learning\nyou know making sure you can teach\npeople and code and do all these sorts\nof different things that you want to do\nbut balancing is hard\nthe whole hands-off approach for me\nprobably wouldn't sit too well yeah\nyeah that's why I need to have like\nyears of it where I'm like all right I'm\ntotally done with the tech let's move on\nto something else yep so yeah so you\nlike like a challenge where you need\nchange\nyeah because there's definitely a\ndifferent skill set for sure oh yeah\nskills a different challenge you're the\none who people are coming to answers for\nlike like as much as it's difficult for\npeople who are getting laid off I'm sure\nlike managers who have maybe no Insight\nor very little information like people\nasking them I'm sure that's gonna be\nlike difficult as well yeah so no I I I\nnot I was actually a part of a exploring\nleadership program internal to Microsoft\nand I it was a really interesting\nrealization as we talked because it was\nabout individual contributor leadership\nright at that so there's a difference\nbetween leadership and management you\nneed you can have it in both but as you\nget into the higher bands even as an IC\nleadership's really important so I took\nthat but one thing that I realized about\nmy hesitancy to become a manager is\nmy performance is no longer based on my\nactions alone and that makes me\nuncomfortable and so like that was like\na big wake-up call to me is like that's\nwhy I've actually avoided the advantage\nof a track so much just because I'm no\nlonger in complete control of my\nperformance\nit's you know I have to trust and\ndelegate that out and it's actually my\nability to give my team what they need\nto be productive that's basing my\nperformance and so that I have to let go\nof a little bit control and so I noticed\nthat it was a little bit of a quirk for\nme that I've been working on\num is like I'm not necessarily set on\ngoing to management but it was just a\nreally interesting insight to look at it\nfrom that perspective and realize like\nI have a little bit of a control thing\nthere you know that is that's kind of my\nyeahit's gonna be toughAlso if anyone needs to\ndrop whenever you need to\nyeah sorry uh yeah I had to apologize\nyeah my internet just dropped for no\nreason\nno worse these these are very informal\nstreams like people expect the absolute\nworst so we're good does anyone know if\nthe AI 900 certification is valuable for\na data engineer\nI was having a conversation with one of\nour colleagues who her name is Gabriella\nshe's actually a principal on the\nstudent academic team\nhas extensive experience highly\nrecommend you all have conversation with\nher if you can has extensive experience\nin the AI space and she mentioned\nsomething really cool about how AI\nmoving forward is going to become like\nan additional skill to\nthe toolkit of a lot of different roles\nso the same way that cloud is now\nbecoming something that a devops\nengineer needs to know a software\ndeveloper needs to know it the same is\ngoing to become for what AI actually is\nso maybe if you ask me this question I a\nyear ago I'd have been like nah but now\nI'm like I think I could see the AI 900\nbeing which is something I'm also\nconsidering for myself being valuable\nfor a lot of different roles curious\nwhat other people think\nyeah to yeah no I definitely think I\nthink\num I had this discussion at sibo with\nCanal who has some great opinion about\nyou know Ai and replacing like a lot of\npeople ask okay I will replace us or\nlike is my job secure anymore\num and he has this interesting say that\nAI will not replace you but people who\nknow Ai and know how to use AI will\nreplace you that's a good one yeah\nso it was interesting and I but to\nanswer the question\nit will be valuable for every engineer\nas Gwen said now but yeah a year ago I I\ndid the AI 900\num in 2022 I think and yeah it doesn't\nhave much like things that are data\nfocused but now I think it'll be\nrelevant\nyeah absolutely\nanyone else got a opinion on that is\nanyone currently upskilling in anything\nAI relatedI'd say I'm looking into it more than I\never did before yeah\num like I'm not I'm not an AI person but\nI'm certainly trying to understand how\nit all works a little bit more than ever\nbefore uh you know you've got things\nlike charge EBT you've got the Google\npart whatever that thing's coming out\nand it's just understanding how it's\nworking how neural networks are working\nall those kind of decision trees and\nthings and it's just been aware like\nmost of being aware rather than actually\nknowing it I think being able to hold a\nconversation around it is importantjust the impact it's out of my\nday-to-day productivity has kept me\nsuper interested in it um but I I've got\nto drop this is oh what do I use it for\nlike I got a couple minutes\num just the programming aspect right so\nin the cloud native world there's a lot\nof different switching between like\nwhether I'm writing kubernet any\nmanifest or I've got to write some bash\nor Powershell and I'm actually using AI\nto translate the area that I because I\nknow it needs to be done I just don't\nknow the syntax and so just being able\nto translate that super quickly uh and\nthen also co-pilot like having that in\nthere like I generated so cool it's it's\nso I was working on a whole workflow\nwhere we deployed bicep deployed\nkubernetes manifest and then I started\ndoing document signing and it accurately\nguessed\nlike probably 60 of the workflow to add\nnotation to digitally sign the container\ncerts and pulled in the right variables\nand stuff and so it's just a huge\nproductivity boost\nnot having to write that boilerplate\ncode thanks\nI was doing some bashed off with it but\nby the way Liam and sorry Richard but\nLiam and Josh we get co-pilot like\naccess to it you know right okay cool\nyeah I didn't know that until like last\nweek someone was like here you can get\nit from this I'm like what so that's why\nI brought it up but yeah Josh thanks so\nmuch for hanging out uh thanks for\nhaving me Josh you'll probably see him\non my Twitter because we're releasing\nBachelor beginners next week uh so make\nsure to follow him but thank you uh and\nanytime you want to practice live\nstreaming let me know and we can take\nyou up on it thanks for having me it's\nnice to meet you both\nsee ya nice to me see if anyone else\nneeds to drop at any point\n[Music]\nI'm going to jump back on that co-pilot\nthing that you're talking about it's\nlike the conversion between different\nlanguages is is awesome so I kind of\nwhat I was doing I think it was like a\nweek ago because this is why it came up\nI think about a week ago when because I\nwas pumping this through trying to find\nout if we can get it for free I was on\nthe technical preview for a year and if\nyou're part of the technical preview you\nthen don't get like the 60 day free\ntrial so I was like how the how can I\nget this but I want to try something and\nI was building a an API server with\nnode.js and express and I was like I\nknow how to do this but what if somebody\ndoesn't know how to write this and go\nhow can I convert exactly that into go\nand vice versa and then do it in Python\nand then into C sharp it was like trying\nto figure out how to do all these\ndifferent languages I don't know how to\nwrite all of them so it was converting\nit down like the right hand side in vs\ncode it's so cool so cool love it yeah\nit's I don't know it was weird because I\nwas you know again I was messing around\nwith bash and I was like all right let\nme see what I can get it to do and it's\nso cool how it adapts to the context\nthat you give it it was because I was\nlike all right let me do a for Loop it\nwas like and pretty simple but okay let\nme give it an array like a variable\narray first and then I knew that I\nwanted to iterate over that and I was\nlike oh my goodness this is so freaking\ncool\nso but again you need to understand what\nyou're doing like if you don't open a\nbook like co-piling like all right do\nsomething for me what if you're not\ngiving it the right context it's not\ngoing to know so it replacing you\nnot necessarily but if you know how to\nleverage itGame Changer absolute game changer\nthat's why it's marketed as the pet\nprogrammer right the pad programming you\nneed right it's not going to be it's not\na replacement program for you it's not\nyour new team it's not the next teammate\nfor you it's it's someone to help you\nit's your co-pilot or something yeah\nand I think that's true with like any\nother AI tools that are that we are\nseeing and an emergence in right it's\nit's you need you still need to know the\nright questions to ask and understand\nthe output of engineering exactly yeah\nbut I was yeah coming back to your point\nif I'm trying or learning something in\nthat aspect yeah just to add to Liam's\nPoint yeah I've been reading about you\nknow how\nthey have been training so I I have no\nlike background in ml or AI so I don't\nknow like you know neural networks and\nhow these machine learning models are\ntrained how AIS learn basically so I've\nbeen reading about those I was reading a\npaper on Google they did where you can\nnow generate music with you know text\nprompts that was really cool they have\nlike a really well detailed paper on it\nit was cool to read\nLiam where did you get that hoodie so\nlet's pull the Sidetrack but I I feel\nlike okay great is it the blue part part\nof the hoodie is that like a shirt under\noh no that's part of the hoodie that's\nlike it's Microsoft Azure one yeah on\nthe back you have like audio\nso in uh in\nthe UK Adam Jackson do you know him uh\nhe's the he used to be the deaf here\nhe's like GTM go to market manager yeah\nyeah really cool guy and um with a lot\nof the community stuff so when we run\nCloud skill challenges usually if you\ncomplete three or more of the modules\num you can like send in that you've\ncompleted it and then they'll send you a\ncode and then they send it out so\nthere's like a whole swag store things\nyou got like bags hoodies bottles the\nbit bit a mascot I think they still have\na couple of those notepads things like\nthat really cool it's basically from\nthere\num I got a whole bunch of things a whole\nbunch of codes yeah you would think it'd\nbe easier for us to get swag but you\ngotta hunt that stuff down it's hard I'm\njust gonna say that it should be easy\nbelieve me when I when I went to Tel\nAviv in December I went to the reactor\nover there when I was doing I was\ntalking to the conference I just my\nwhole suitcase was just full full of\nswag I got ring lights I got notepads I\ngot power Banks I got the holster bank I\ndidn't miss anything they they have\nreally good like did you get those those\nnotebooks that are\num like Gray\nlike the reactor ones I got a bunch of\nthose because they're like great quality\nokay all the stickers all in it but I\nhad I went to where is it uh Redmond\nRedmond for build uh and I like to pack\nmy suitcase and all that and it's a\nlittle bit lasting because I try to give\nit away here\nbut yeah it's freaking hard to get uh\nimpossible swag here it shouldn't be\nhere we go any advice on upskilling post\nlayoff I was recently like go engineer\nat Splunk but I don't know whether prior\nis Passion or relevancy when it comes to\npreparing for my next role\nokay that's loaded yeah it's an evolved\nquestion there I think\nI think it was something that like\npeople tend to to kind of like on\nTwitter or whatever provide advice it's\nlike we tend to forget like the the\nhuman being aspects of like that kind of\nimpact like we're so quick to be like\nupscale up skill tech tech and it's like\nwell there's humans and there's emotions\nevolved here too so I would say like\nfirst like\nget a feel for where you're at\num because you know with like an out\nwith\na layoff I think there's also an\nopportunity for you to realize like was\nwhat was what I doing what was I doing\nactually what I wanted to do or is there\nsomewhere else something else that I\nwanted to do more what did I like about\nwhat I was doing what I didn't like\nabout I was doing so there's an\nopportunity for that\nI guess it also matters like the\nsituation that you're in like you have\nlike massive urgency to get a next role\nthen probably easier to be in what\nyou're still in or do you do you have\nsome like leeway\num\nI think that's like what comes to mind\nright now it's like highly personal too\ndoes anyone else have any insight thereI think just second what you said I I\ndon't think there's anything more to it\nthan that it's a very personal\nit's a very subjective answer that you\ncould give so if I was answering that\nquestion I would take time off I would\nprobably look at what I would want to do\nnext look what's hot in the market and\nsee what I would possibly be interested\nin\num on the flip side if I really needed a\njob tomorrow then it's like I know I'm\nokay advocacy I know I'm okay\nengineering I'll go find one of those\nroles but I'm not going to go jump into\nlike an AI role for example because\nthat's not what I do\nyeah I think you put it really well good\num like just coming back to that human\npart of things you know it's like it's\nabout the reality like if if there's an\nurgency like I would\num pick up you know maybe I'll reach out\nto my old jobs and um go there or yeah\nit's about the the need at the right\ntime I guess\nyeah I would agree someone asked to me\nhere\nGPS you see yourself going into Cloud\nsecurity\nno but I see myself\nI also feel like security is becoming\none of those things where it's like a an\nadditional tool that you should have in\nyour toolkit so I do see myself\nupskilling in that area but I don't\nthink I would go full on like like the\nday like dedicated Cloud security person\num but I think it's an interesting space\nvery high in demand very lucrative as\nwell\num especially when it comes to like\nsecurity with kubernetes security with\nserverless securely with uh all Cloud\nnative stuff like I think there's just\nso much untapped potential there but\nit's just personally not something that\nI'm\nvery interested in so not you ever\nthought about becoming an ambassador for\nlike something security related\nuh\nMaybe\nbut I think the upskilling part is still\nthe missing thing\num\nI don't know I I thought about doing\nthat for like Cloud native in general\nbecause like the foundation has\nambassadors right oh my goodness my cat\nis stepping on my camera also let me\nturn this off\num but yeah I think I'm just like so\nbusy with everything else I've got going\non oh I can't move the cameraare you guys part of any other programs\noutside of like or like um\nGoogle developer expert anything like\nthat\nyeah I'm I'm the part of the AWS\nCommunity Builders now for the third\nyear\num and then also this year\num the getpad community heroum but yeah I've known so I recently got\nto know about the GitHub Stars which is\nwhich looks pretty good\num it's I think I think this look at\nyour open source contributions\nso I don't know if I should yeah I don't\nwanna no I was gonna say if I I don't\nknow if I should mention this on live\nstream but I have nominated you Gwen\num oh thank you yeah so you can nominate\nI didn't know I didn't know the program\nexisted first of all and second of all\nhow the nomination works so I started\nlooking it up it's as easy as you know\nso anyone in the public can nominate and\nthen they look at your GitHub profile I\nthink and then see if you know you have\nmade valuable\num open source contributions and then\nyou receive an email I guess\nso yeah I got to know about that through\nlike tweets and stuff so recently people\ngot renewed or something\num yeah so that is one those kinds of\nthings especially for students yeahthey have a student's one now yeah\nthey're just recently launched\nGoogle\nthat's GitHub campus experts yeah\nGoogle one is a Google student developer\nclubs so you have Club captains and\nstuffLiam are you part of anything outside of\nMicrosoft\nyeah I am I'm an all-zero ambassador so\nsecurity focused I literally wanted to\nknow about security therefore did\neverything I could to get into that club\nuh that's how you do it also is a really\nreally cool uh company part of OCTA\num like absolutely totally awesome great\nswag great people and it's a great way\nto learn about security because they do\nsort of constant training for you\num kind of like what we do with MVPs at\nMicrosoft but they do like consistent\ntraining which is really cool not just\non their products but Security in\ngeneral uh also part of the dev Network\nAdvisory board but I also feel like that\nthat's like a huge bushel at the moment\nso helping with hackathons and Community\nconferences and how they're run and put\ntogether that kind of stuff\nnice very cool yeah I feel like six of\nthose too for a lot of there's a lot of\nthese programs that definitely help your\nresume definitely help your learning\nthat are definitely for you to join uh\nsome do require nomination like MVP\nstill requires that but there are a lot\nof them that are are essentially they\njust look at your contributions in that\nspace which you can do at any level that\nyou're at like you're brand new and then\nyou start writing some AWS stuff like\nyou could you could join the AWS\nCommunity build the program\num I think that's cool you also get like\nnetworking with people who work at the\ncompany or who are already part of the\ncommunities or things like that it's\nlike massive\num like I mentioned student ambassador\nprograms stuff like imagine cup like you\ncan actually win like a like a meeting\nwith Satya Nadella that is so cool\ncan you imagine that so so many\nquestionsrolling them off one after the other\nyeahyeah like but this and this also I think\njust a great there's a lot of great\nthings that come from just networking\nwith people who are\nsomehow in a similar situation like if\nall you have in common is like just\nsomeone just for this Tech or something\nlike that then I think that's that's\nawesome too but you may find other\nstudents other people who are trying to\nchange careers or things like that just\nby like putting yourself into these\nthings which I think is\ndefinitely yeah lots and then you have\nlike other benefits too right like\ncredits and\num resources that you can utilize uh\nespecially when you think of students\nright\num you get few money to spend on like\ncloud services so you could host your\nprojects and stuff which is a cool thing\nto have\num and then to Liam's point you get with\nmost of these programs you get training\num\nwhich is good to have\na thousand percent well guys I'm gonna\nend it here I gotta head home for the\nweekend thank you so much for hopping on\nit's a fantastic conversation\nuh Liam I'll probably talk to you like\nnext week or something I will see you\nnext week\nthanks for having me\nthank youoh no I have a live stream on Wednesday\nokay first hold on let's plug I have\nLinux on Azure on Wednesday so come\nlearn about open source at Microsoft or\nvery uh interesting relationship with or\nI guess our journey and relationship\nwith open source uh how to leverage\nLinux on Azure and then we're going to\ndeploy some Linux stuff to Azure in my\nin my talk do you guys have anything\nhappening this week coming upI've got the go show so contrary to\neverything that's going on\num I'm I'm plugging the go show uh so\nit's a bi-weekly stream which again is\nstarting on Wednesday 2 p.m GM GMT yep\nuh UK time\nand that is just gonna be talking all\nthings go I think this week I'm going to\nbe doing uh Json and how you can start\nuh to manipulate data in go because it's\nnot very friendly uh it's not as\nfriendly as other languages but it's\nalso really cool and I'm going to be\ndeploying apps to azure showing you how\nyou can do that pretty easily follow\nLiam on Twitter\nLiam see Hampton's right there on hers\nyeah Rich have you got anything this\nweek yep\num so this week actually I forgot to\nmention when you were asking about this\nweek my first\num I've done my first sponsorship videos\nand it's with Microsoft so oh cool way\nto go\num you're welcome yeah yeah so GitHub\nactions video is out and then next week\non Thursday uh there's a video that will\nbe on vs code and along with azure uh\nfunctions so in Python\nyes okay\nokay everyone plenty to learnuh thanks everyone for hanging out",
