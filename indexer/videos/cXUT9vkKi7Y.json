  "transcript": "hi everyone welcome to another video\nwhere i\nanswer the most popular questions\ncomments that i get in my youtube\ncomment section area gwen\ni've got the certification i've been\nfollowing these\ncertification courses i want to get\nhands on\nwhat are some projects that you\nrecommend i've got a list of three\nbeginner friendly projects that will\ngive you some hands-on cloud experiencewhat i will preface this list with is\nyou're going to get the most benefit not\nonly for yourself\nbut perhaps for other people by just\ndocumenting what you've learned any\ndifficulties any challenges\nany things that you that like stood out\nand became super interested\nin or something that you want to\ncontinue looking into anything really\nabout the process of of\nlike learning these projects or doing\nthese projects you know throw them up on\non an article on dev too\nor on hash note or you can use your\ngithub or if you have your own blog\nwhatever it is i'm not telling you to go\nstart blogging every single day or\nyou know creating youtube videos or\ntwitch streaming all the time no\nabsolutely not\nbut you will get a benefit out of\ndocumenting what you're doing\nand sort of building this online public\nlearning space for yourself\nbecause not only are you someone else\ncould learn from you but also\nyou learn more when you write out or\nwhen you talk about\nsomething that you've been working on\nalso\nit's like a little plus that you can add\nto your resume like hey\ni also you know blog about this or i\nwrite about the stuff that i work on\nhere you know just saying\njust saying anyway the first project\nthat i recommend\nobviously you have an account on aws\nazure gcp wherever it is\nyou have an account right right i\nunderstand that they are these learning\nservices out there that provide sandbox\nenvironments but if you are\nserious about cloud computing you need\nto have an account you just need to\nall of these cert these platforms have\nfree tier and services that are free and\nsome of them have\nlike free credits when you sign up for\nlike a certain amount of months\nyou get free credits go do that\nand once you have your account or if you\nalready have your account\nspend some time looking into cost\nmanagement and set up billing alerts\nset up budgets because the number one\nquestion that i get from clients and\nright away is\nhow much is this gonna cost sure\nworking with new technologies and tools\nand services\nand programming languages is really cool\nbut that's cool to us\nthat's cool to us as developers as\nengineers\nwhatever clients want to know the money\naspect how much is this gonna cost me\nhow can we save or what's like what's\nthe implemented budget\nor you know how can we prevent it from\ngoing\nover budget stuff like that so figure\nthat out for your own account\nand please document this somewhere\ni don't think i see i see enough\narticles on like\nserverless or you know building this\nwith some new front-end framework\nsolid i get i get that it's interesting\nbut there's not enough of like the\nbasics and\nand most important stuff like cost\nmanagement so go do that\ngo set yourself up for success and also\nit helps you when you're like\nbuilding stuff and playing with your own\naccount and your platform it helps you\nnot go over budget and then you end up\nwith a bill\nlike a thousand dollars because you\nforgot to erase something so\nyou know that's your first project go do\nthat second one\na resume api uh my friend richard\nactually uh brought this to my attention\nduring serverless september he built a\nresume his own resume\nan api of his resume using azure\nfunctions in javascript\nthe language and the serverless function\noffering is irrelevant you can do this\nin\nyou know lambda for aws or cloud\nfunctions with gcp\nazure functions with azure that doesn't\nmatter\ni'll link some articles that have uh\nexamples for\nazure and aws you can follow us if you\nwant but this is cool because\npersonally i don't have like a per like\na website\nlike i have where my made by gps.com\nwhere i have like my study notes and\nstuff that i write about\nin terms of what i'm earning and such\nbut i don't have like my resume online\nso this became very interesting to me\nwhere it's like it's just an api so it's\njust text\ni don't have to really design anything\nand that has always been my issue with\nanything front and related really or\nanything that you needed to be able to\nlook at\nbecause i can't even draw a circle i'm\nterrible at ui\nbut this also gives you exposure to\nsomething like serverless which you hear\nme talk about all the timei don't want to sound like a sales pitch\nbut serverless is definitely something\nthat is just\ngaining so much momentum so much\nattention and support\nand this is a great project for you to\ngo get hands-on with that\nso yes resume api i will have articles\nfor that i'll have articles for these\nprojects\nin the description or maybe i'll put it\nin like a one page on a blog post or\nsomething so it's easier for you to see\nall of them\nanyway and the third one i don't know if\nit's because i'm looking\nfor it more but i just see a lot more\narticles and\nquestions and conversations about\nterraform and i know it's been a\npopular tool for a whilebut get hands on with terraform luckily\ntheir website their official website has\nit getting started for all the major\nplatforms\nand there's sections in there um you can\nyou know you'll use the cli you'll build\ninfrastructure\nyou will delete infrastructure all that\njazz\nand again follow that that's a nice\nproject to like kind of get started and\nthen eventually you can just start\ndeploying infrastructure in your own\naccount\njust via terraform i know there are\nother offerings i know for example azure\nuh\nazure resource manager templates are\nvery popular as well\nbut i think terraform is your best bang\nfor your buck in terms of\nyou know learning one that can work with\nall the platforms\nso yeah that is your third project go\ngo through the entire getting started\nwith terraform on their website\nand a fourth one which is not\nnecessarily a project but i would say\nif you want more ideas you can go to the\n100 days of cloud github repo and\nthere's an ideas repo there you can grab\none\ngo through it it'll give you like a time\nestimate kind of like a category what\nthe project is about\ni know i've uh i've i've contributed a\nbunch of project\nideas on there and then you can\ncontribute as well i'll link the youtube\nvideo where you can go\nuh contribute a project there as well i\nthink that was also a great way for you\nto get hands-on with github\nif i'm with git and github if you're not\nfamiliar with that\nalso super important um but yeah there\nthere's kind of like\nmy list of things that i think you\nshould be able to do\nright as you start getting interested in\ncloud\nyeah anyway any questions comments\nfeedback\njust want to talk cloud uh hit me up on\ntwit uh\nyeah twitter i haven't been too active\non twitter lately\nbut uh yeah made by gps or leave it in\nthe description\nuh catch me on a twitch stream i'm\nalways in you know active\nwhen those things are going on you can\njust hit me in the chat with something\nuh if not i will see you in the next\nvideo see you later",
