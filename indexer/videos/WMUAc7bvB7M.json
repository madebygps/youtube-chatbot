  "transcript": "hey everyone today we are covering three\ncloud roles i'm going to try to outline\na potential career path into these roles\ncertifications that might be helpful and\nsort of skills and responsibilities\nyou'll be using day-to-day\ni'm going to try to cover like the most\npopular ones that i get asked about but\nif you have more suggestions for roles\nthat you want to see me cover that\naren't in this video let me know in the\ncomments\nuh two things i want to mention before\nwe dive into it i know cloud engineer is\nprobably the most popular role out there\ni just want to say that cloud engineer\nis extremely generic at one point in my\ncareer i was a cloud engineer all it\nreally means is that to some capacity\nyou're going to be working with cloud\ninfrastructure and cloud platform and it\ncould end up being any one of the roles\nin this video or even roles that i don't\nmention in this video\nso yeah keep that in mind and second\nyour potential in landing any one of\nthese roles will increase exponentially\nif your people skills are on point\nif you can interview well if you can\ncommunicate your technical skill set to\na technical audience and to say like a\nbusiness team or to a team that doesn't\ninteract with the tech stack every day\noverall if you're just someone who\npeople enjoy working with\nyou're going to have a better chance at\nlanding these roles right\nall right with all that out of the way\nhi i'm gps and welcome to a new video\nall right let's kick things off with\ncloud administrator so if you're a cloud\nadmin you're someone who's focused on\nmaintaining already existing\ninfrastructure\nthat your company or has in place maybe\nit's been developed or built by a\ndifferent team and then your goal is\nreally to just be there and making sure\neverything's smooth sailing on the\nday-to-day in terms of a career path if\nyou're already sort of like maybe a sys\nadmin a network engineer in some sort of\noperations role you can 100 leverage\nyour existing skills and talent into a\ncloud admin role uh helpful\ncertifications would be the aws\nsolutions architect associate level\nthe azure administrator az az104 and\nthen google has the google cloud\nengineer\nthis is the only associate level uh\ncertification that they have available\nso i'd recommend taking a look at that\npick the one for the cloud platform that\nyou're interested in\nwhen it comes to administration related\ncertifications it's more about sort of\nhaving a wide range of knowledge a bunch\nof different cloud services instead of\ngoing in depth with any of them\ncloud admin roles tend to be more entry\nlevel friendly\nwhich is great for people are looking to\nbreak into\nthe space but that's also why they\nexpect you to have sort of wide range of\na bunch of different services instead of\nbeing like an absolute expert in maybe\nlike a smaller range or things like that\nright\nyou're going to need to be able to uh\nlike you know understand infrastructure\nand application monitoring uh things\nlike new relic data dog azure monitor\naws cloudwatch et cetera\nin your day to day you could find\nyourself reviewing or querying\nmonitoring data making sure\ninfrastructure your applications are\nrunning smoothly and as expected\nyou're going to need to script tasks\nwith some sort of scripting language\npython bash\nor powershell\nyou know things like creating new user\naccounts new cloud accounts\nwith the proper permissions or uh\nperhaps creating infrastructure that\nsomeone else or some other team has\nprovided for you\nyou're going to also need to be able to\nwork with other you know other team\nmembers or maybe it's a different team\nthings like that to understand how you\nshould maintain new infrastructure\nthat's being built or implemented\nand things like that and you're going to\nneed to know how to work with cost\nmanagement and budgets\nimplement new budgets for new projects\nand generate reports on\ncosts if someone asks you hey like how\nmuch did this service cost\nthe past two weeks you need to be able\nto generate that report\nuh i think that's pretty much\nwhat a cloud admin does\nall right on to the next cloud architect\nso a cloud architect is someone who is\nfocused on planning\na\nwell-built\ncloud solution cloud project uh they're\noften\ni would say maybe like i don't know 90\nof the time people with years and years\nof experience and people who have\non other projects been like the\ndevelopers the the administrators or you\nknow what not\nbecause when it comes to architecting\nyou need to be able to answer the\nquestion like what's the best tool for\nthis job and if you haven't worked with\nlike a bunch of different services on a\nbunch of different projects you won't\nknow it's just like inexperiencing right\nso they're not as\nentry-level friendly as other cloud\nroles so just keep that in mind so in\nterms of a career path you could\nprobably leverage if you're already in a\ncloud role uh your years in a cloud role\ninto a cloud architect\nuh role but again\nit's probably gonna be hard if this is\nsomething you're interested in as\nsomeone who's new to the space but some\nhelpful certifications would be the\nmicrosoft certified azure solutions\narchitect expert i believe it's two\ncertifications and then there's the\ngoogle professional cloud architect\nand then there's the aws solutions\narchitect pro i think all of these\nactually require two certifications the\ngoogle one may not i\ngoogle it i'm not 100 sure\nthat one but yeah you're going to need\nto like design monitoring design\nsecurity solutions to kind identity\ndesign storage design business\ncontinuity design infrastructure\neverything so if someone tells you hey i\nhave this application i need to deploy\neverything that goes around it how\npeople access it how do you just secure\nit where just where is the storage going\nto be like what regions do we need to\ndeploy and what yeah like what are our\ndisaster recovery plans all of those\nthings you need to be able to design\nthose things right\nso this is why it's sort of necessary to\nhave a good knowledge of an entire cloud\nplatform like in and out you need to\nknow that thing in and out on to the\nlast one for this video which is cloud\ndeveloper uh so a cloud of air player is\nsomeone who is focused on sort of\nbuilding solutions using cloud services\nuh and if you\nlike to program and code and things like\nthat this is the role for you\nin terms of a career path if you're\nalready say a software dev or in a role\nthat you program a lot you could\ndefinitely leverage those skills and i\nwould also say that developer roles are\nentry level friendly maybe not as much\nas admin roles but\nso pretty friendly\nso some helpful certifications for here\nwould be the aws certified developer\nassociate and the azure developer which\nis the 204\nand i think\ngoogle professional\ndeveloper cloud developer or something\nlike that they don't have an associate\nlevel one i don't know why google's like\nthat that's just the way they are um but\nyeah you have those certification\noptions pick the one for the platform\nthat you want to learn\nyou're gonna need to\nunderstand uh\napplication monitoring so similar to the\nadmin that the admin is a little bit\nmore focused on infrastructure you're\ngoing to need to be more focused on\napplication because in your code when\nyou're developing solutions you're going\nto need to be able to code things that\nwill send\nlogs and data to your monitoring things\nlike that uh you're gonna have to be\nable to work with\ni said that weird you're gonna need to\nwork with\nuh command line tools so your cloud\nplatform via command line tools\nand uh also work with your cloud\nplatform and your cloud services with\nsdks software development kits\nall cloud platforms have different sdks\nwhether that be java c sharp python\njavascript things like that uh build\nserver solutions so getting hands-on\nwith something like aws lambda azure\nfunctions it's definitely a plus low\ncode and no code solutions is also\nsomething i would recommend looking into\nthings like logic apps or the power\nplatform when it comes to azure\ni think aws has like\nstep functions or cloud functions\nsomething like that\nbut yeah low code and no code is sort of\ndefinitely something that you can\nleverage here uh storage and messaging\nsolutions like you need to be able to\nsave data somewhere get data from\nsomewhere and messaging is sort of the\nservices that will connect all your\nthings together so understanding\nmessaging uh and database services as\nwell\nand of course you're gonna have to build\nyour solutions in a secure manner so\nunderstanding how applications can\nimplement security uh to like log in or\naccess other cloud services is important\nfor you to know as well\nand that is it for this video i've\ncovered three if you want me to cover\nmore maybe we'll turn this into a series\nor something like that just let me know\nin the comments thank you for watching\nand i'll see you in the next one",
