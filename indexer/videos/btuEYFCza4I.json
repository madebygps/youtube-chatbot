  "transcript": "hi everyone thank you for joining us\ntoday for how to get into tech and\nserverless with linda nichols before i\nintroduce our speakers i want to go over\na few quick things\nplease take a moment to read our code of\nconduct\nwe ask that you be kind and respectful\nto everyone including our speakers we\nwant the reactor to be a place that\neveryone feels welcome\nplease ask questions using the live\nyoutube twitch or twitter chat wherever\nyou are joining us from\num we will be taking questions from\nthere throughout the presentation and\nthen in the chat we'll also be sharing\nsome links that go along with today's\ncontent and some upcoming sessions\nthis session will be added to our\nreactor youtube page in 24 to 48 hours\nso if you aren't able to stay for the\nwhole thing or you want to share it\nafterwards you will be able to find it\nthere\nand then finally i will share a link to\nour reactor survey if you have a few\nminutes we greatly appreciate your\nfeedback and i am now going to pass it\nover to gwenhi everyone how are we doing welcome to\nthe first live stream for serverless\nseptember\nmy name is gwen dion thank you for that\namazing introduction as always i am a\ncloud developer advocate here at\nmicrosoft\noverall a big fan of.net and all things\nserverless and like i mentioned\nwith it being september we're doing a\nwhole serverless september month best\nmonth of the year if you ask me but i\nmight be a little biased\nand we got a lot we got a lot planned\ntoday we had a great conversation today\nbut i do want to kick it off by sort of\njust introducing you all to some things\nthat you can get done this month to get\nhands-on with serverless first is our\nwhat's it called hack\nso\non our microsoft reactor youtube channel\nyou might have seen this already if\nyou're subscribed to our channel we have\na whole on-demand series i believe it's\n12 videos where we're walking through\nwhere i'm walking through\nthe what the hack serverless edition\nwhere we're building a full-on\nserverless project\nwhat it is it's like this license plate\nscanner and it uses computer vision and\ncosmos tv and servlets and all these\nkinds of things\nto\nclassify license plate photos and\nthere's a whole series on that you can\nget hands-on put it on your resume and\nthe cool thing about that project is if\nyou complete it\nyou can submit your project to our\nofficial repo and then get promoted not\npromoted i guess featured on our hall of\nfame and then you'll be featured on a\nofficial microsoft repo\nwhich i think is awesome especially if\nyou're trying to you know find things to\nlike stand out with or share in social\nmedia and all that kind of stuff all\nthose kinds of things and whatnot so\ni'm going to be sort of showcasing\nuh completed solutions and things like\nthat over the next couple of streams\nthat we have this month we're gonna have\nstreams every single thursday for the\nmonth of september right here on the\nreactor youtube\nand we also have the cloud skills\nchallenge you may or may not be familiar\nwith cloud skills challenge essentially\nit is\na bunch of microsoft learn modules put\ntogether that have some sort of theme or\nyou know they're they're they're meant\nto follow or teach you some specific\nskill set in this case we have one\nspecific to serverless on azure and we\nhave drop the link for that as well\nin the chat so get hands-on with that\nand there's like it's pretty fun because\nthere's like leaderboards and all these\nkinds of things um and yes uh what else\ndo we have uh there's yeah we dropped\nthe classical challenge there the\nserverless hacks yeah i'm very excited\nto see people complete the\nthe hack\num it took me\nquite a while to put that stuff together\nand i think that's a good thing because\nit's it's a lot more difficult than i\nthought it was going to be i have a\ncouple of years of serverless under my\nbelt um\nno way am i on the level of our guests\nbut\nwe'll talk about that in a second\num\nbut yeah it was a lot harder it wasn't\nit's not a walk in the park so it's\ngreat you're gonna learn a couple things\nand get something for your resume right\nso today we have one of my favorite\npeople and i'm gonna say this before i\nbring her on because she's not gonna\nallow me to give me give her the credit\nthat she deserves but um like two years\nago i think or maybe three years ago i\ncan't remember exactly\ni was listening to this podcast called\nserverless chats\nand linda who's our guest for today\nwas on this episode and i remember she\nsaid this line that has just always been\nsort of how i i i carry my advocacy\nand and i just think about my career and\nshe said something along the lines of\nthe amount of lines of code that you\nwrite does not determine how good of an\nengineer you are\nand i think now that you know we think\nof cloud computing and all these\nservices that abstract a lot of things\nand allow us to focus more on our\nbusiness logic\nthis sentiment this statement could you\nknow it couldn't be\nlike more important than\nright now so with all that being said\ni'm gonna bring on\nlinda nichols one of my favorite people\nand has made a massive impact in my\ncareer as well and this is actually our\nfirst time officially talking on\nsomething like this i know which i'm\nsurprised um but yes welcome thank you\nfor for for being on here thank you um\nthis is going to be a great\na great chat\nyeah i will yeah no it's the admiration\nis mutual um i mean i talk a lot about\ndurable functions now but the first\ndurable functions video i watched was\nyours\nreally i was like\nwhat are durable functions like do i\ncare about this and then i saw some\nstuff from jeff holland and then i saw\nyour video and i was like wait who is\nthis\nand what is this content yeah and then i\nthink i started going through and liking\nall your videos\ni'm stalker asked\nappreciate the the support it's really\ncool to see\nlike i remember when i started making\nthose videos and you were one of the\nfirst people who was like very\nsupportive that was way before i even\nthought like joining microsoft and\nworking here was a possibility and now\njust to see where i'm at and it's all\nthanks to people have been very\nsupportive to you which is why i also\nwanted you to be on this first\nserverless september live stream and and\nalso we've discussed how we have\nsomewhat similar journeys into tech\nwhich is another thing i wanted to talk\nabout but let's let's let's start off by\nfirst you know we're the server\nseptember\ni'm saying this word serverless we\nshould do a game people should like\ni don't know keep it tiley of how many\ntimes we say the word serverless but\nlet's first start by defining serverless\nbecause i feel like\nthe definition from when i got started\nis now kind of different it kind of\nevolves i feel like it's something that\nchanges all the time but i would love to\nhear from you how do you define surplus\nsure um it's funny because every talk\nfor the longest time you had to have a\nwhat is serverless slide so you could\njust set the stage like this is what i\nthink it is and then there would be some\nsort of fierce debate\num but i used to always say it's about\nevents\nbut it's about event driven\narchitectures you know and that and\nthat's basically the serverless part of\nit i mean but some of it is also just\nlots of layers of abstraction and\nbasically like you don't know anything\nabout the infrastructure you don't know\nanything about the hardware i don't\nreally like it used to be you only pay\nfor what you use but i don't feel like\nthat's necessarily true anymore because\nthere's all these different pay scales\nand things so that's sort of out the\nwindow for me\ni it's not fast either which i've always\nsaid that you know serverless is not\none fast product it's architectures it's\nevent driven\num and so now i think i'm like low i\ndon't want to say low effort but low\ninfra\nis still\nvery high\nokay okay so for you it's more so it has\nto be event driven\nand\nto some extent you have to not have to\ncare about the infrastructure right okay\nso so what about things like you know\nwhat now we have like serverless\ndatabases and here's an interesting one\nserverless containers\ni think that is such a because it used\nto be such a like serverless versus\ncontainers and now we have\nlike the sort of like this hybrid\napproach\nuh and i feel like everything is is is\nhaving some sort of serverless flavor as\nwell and then you also have things like\nlow code and no code which some people\nclassify as serverless which i guess\ncould be to an extent so how do you feel\nabout everything being just\ngetting like the serverless label\nslapped onto it yeah i mean\ndepending on what you mean by low code\nthat's actually pretty server full\nbecause it's usually like sas products\nlike power platform so i feel like\nthat's more server server full\nbut um yeah like i remember a while back\nbeing on some panel and we were talking\nabout the features we needed to serve\nthose platforms and i was like i said we\nhave to be able to bring our own\ncontainer at some point like bring our\nown run time and i mean it was like a\nrecord scratched in the back and people\nwere like\nthat's not really truly serverless but\nit was a need at the time and and i\nthink that's now happening like so i\nthink it's like\nit me like serverless almost meets you\nwhere you are if i'm like i just want to\ntake my\ntiny piece of code push it somewhere and\nforget about it and then it i just\ntrigger it and it works okay that's\nserverless but also if i want to if i\nhave something running in kubernetes\nwith cada and i want to trigger that and\ni sort of know something about the\nkubernetes that's happening okay that's\nserverless also\nokay and so\nbut i think if something is a serverless\nplatform it does tend to be a little\nless\ninfra and it is more like plug and play\npush and go and even like container apps\neven though we know there's\ninfrastructure there and we know there's\na container\nit's still kind of push and go\nit's really it's taking a lot of the the\nstruggle of of um all the info away from\nit okay okay i like i like that\ndefinition i\ni'm sure you've seen plenty of changes\nfrom when you got into to serverless and\nto where it is now but i want to take it\neven\na couple steps back because i'm sure you\ndidn't start your career as a server\nlike working with serverless and you\nknow talking about these things\nyeah i'm um yeah uh yeah i'm definitely\nold school i mean some of the concepts\nare the same but um\nyou know obviously there was no cloud\nwhen i started like in 1999\num\nbut i started on my very first tech job\nwas on a help desk which we've talked\nabout shout out\nbecause i saw your tweet about it and i\nwas like shut up i also start on the\nhelp desk this is so cool but yeah i\nmean the funny thing about it was\ni start you know a lot of people are\nlike i'm going to start with tech\nsupport i'm going to get on the help\ndesk because this is a great stepping\nstone for my career in tech\nbut for me i just thought it was a job i\nwas like this is what i'm gonna do the\nrest of my life like there's a potential\ni can make thirty thousand dollars doing\nthis i'm gonna retire\nlike because you know i was a basically\nan art school dropout i had half an art\ndegree wow i did not know that yeah part\nof a bio degree i had no money\nand i was like paying for for college\nlike making drawings and building\ncomputers\nokay in like a drawing i'd sell for ten\ndollars a computer rebuild i would make\na hundred dollars so i knew math\nand i was like okay i think this tech\nthing is what i'm gonna do so i got a\ncertification which i know that you're\nalso passionate which one\na-plus okay cool cool back then it had\ndas on it still wow okay cool\nyeah so i got that cert\ni applied for this job randomly and they\ncalled me in for an interview and\nbasically i had\nhad new business giving me this job\nthey felt like okay you've had like\nevery you know average job\nyou know that faces the public your\nwhole life you know customer service you\nhave the certification you seem pretty\nnice and here's this job and i was like\nyes this is i am in tech now this is\nwhat i'm going to do the rest of my life\ni'll just be on this help desk\num\nbut\nafter about six months i got bored\nokay i taught myself out of code and\nbasically became shadow i.t and then\nthat was\nwhat\nwas the first language what did you\nteach yourself\nwell microsoft access and vba\nokay okay\nyeah\nso um i uh i started after i kind of\nlike started getting into it then i\nlearned c so c was like my first\nofficial reel whoa do you do any\nanything in c now currently no when's\nthe last time you touched c c\noh like\nprobably more than 10 years yeah\nprobably when i went back to school and\nactually made things official you know\nbecause i did ultimately finish my\ndegree and got a master's and\nwhatnot but once i went back then yeah i\nlearned c c plus and then i was like\nokay now i get it now that i have all\nthe foundations of it but i was\nbasically self-taught for a really long\ntime i did vb6\nafter i left the helpdesk job my first\nprogramming job was 56.\nso did you go back to school for like\ncomputer science\nyeah i finished the actually the art\ndegree and then minored\nin it and then to the masters in i.t did\ndid that make\na difference in roles that you were able\nto land after that or was that more sort\nof like just something you wanted to\nfinish it did it did make a difference\nbut honestly it shouldn't have\nokay i didn't i didn't you know i feel\nlike especially with the master's degree\ni learned more about management\ni learned more about leadership i think\nwith you know i i made connections i\nmade like connections for life in my\nmaster's program\nbut um and i learned some interesting\nthings in undergrad but really it was\njust there were so many jobs where you\nhad to have that check box in order to\nmake a certain pay level and i just i\nthink i hit a ceiling at some point\nwhere it was like no you can't get that\npromotion there you can get that pay\nbecause you don't have this degree\nand i was early in career and i felt\nlike oh okay well this is the rules and\ni go do it now i would tell them\nokay i'll go get another job i'll go\nsomewhere else yeah yeah and so if\nanyone runs into that\nyou know feel free to bring me in as\nyour coach\nbecause now i'm like older and wiser and\ni'm like it doesn't actually matter i've\nhired\npeople as a manager with tons of\ndifferent backgrounds but yeah that\nit's it's interesting it's both\ninteresting and awesome now how things\nare are very different but even though\nthings are really different i've still\nconsidered and i think i've tweeted\nabout this and i think you've mentioned\nsomething about this as well but\ni still in the back of my head are like\noh someday i'll go and finish because i\nhave two semesters of my comp sci degree\nand i'm like at some point i am going to\nfinish it i don't know when but i don't\nknow what it is about maybe it's because\nit's like it was such a norm for such a\nlong time that it's sort of like\nembedded in our brains that we have to\ndo it\num and sort of letting go of that kind\nof like way of thinking is tough but\ni'm very glad that things are much\ndifferent now uh and you know more\nopportunities for more people and\nwhatnot\nbut i'm i'm assuming that at some point\nafter help desk you got some sort of\nsoftware engineering or software\ndeveloper gig or like what was that\nfirst official gig where you find\nyourself coding like every day\nyeah i mean the first official job was\nupgrading visual basic three to visual\nbasic six that was my job it was like\nsome benefits company and they had an\nold bb3 app they wanted to go to vb6 and\nthat was hard was that like it was very\nboring okay\nand that was when i learned i really\nliked more like web development and so i\nwas doing even on the help desk i had\nlearned classic asp because that was how\ni wanted to make web pages so that\npeople so so just to back up i rewrote\nour help desk software that was my\nshadow it project\na while at the help desk yeah well i\nthink okay okay every day that makes i\nwas like this is trash i'm rewriting\nthis\nso i also had to make a webpage for it\nyou know in html and classic asp and\nfront page and all the old folks are\nlike oh yeah yeah i remember all that\nand um and so then i had to learn kind\nof like web development there i had like\nactually like a web development for\ndummies book that i bought to learn all\nthis\num so then when i went back to desktop\napplications i was like this is kind of\nboring i don't really like this\nand then um you know from there i kind\nof started getting more into into web\ndevelopment so the next job i was\nactually just doing classic asp and more\nweb dev full time classic asp that's\nis that c sharps though like right well\nyou could it yeah most mostly it was\nlike vbscript\nokay yeah you had you could use like\nvarious scripting languages but vbscript\nwas i think the most popular one maybe\nsomebody will disagree\num yeah there was various like scripting\nyou could do with it and then it was\nlike and then you know client-side\njavascript too so we do a little bit of\nclient-side javascript for some\nokay\nso\nokay there's many questions i want to\nask here but let's go with this first\none here\nso now\nand we'll talk about your current role\nin a little bit but what's the language\nyou use the most now javascript\njavascript yeah uh-huh so but\nwhen i started to go back to school\ni actually switched to java from from\nsort of i was in i was i was\ntransitioning to net and then i think i\nwas gonna go back to school they had a\njava requirement this was for my\nmaster's program and so i was like okay\ni need to learn java i learned it i\nreally liked it i was like i liked like\nthe structure of it and i and i think\nmaybe i liked it was a little bit more\nlike c c plus\nso i switched to java\nand then i i was an enterprise like java\ndeveloper for seven years so i spent a\nhuge chunk in the java environment\ndesign patterns\nbut\nyou know just very like very intensely\ninto only\nprogramming and then\nfrom there\nyou know i think i just i finished my\nmaster's program i would just i went had\nan itch\nand so then i heard about this brand new\nthing called node.js where we were doing\njavascript on the server and it was just\nlike\nand they weren't using real development\ntools like no eclipse people were just\nusing notepad plus plus the code it yeah\nit was like the wild wild west and i was\nlike all right sign me up so\nanyway i went to node and i haven't gone\nback so so now if i just if i write like\na azure function or something it's\nalways almost always node.js\ni did not know that is so\nhave you used\nmy i don't want to say modern.net but\nlike dot net latelyah\nyes but not that often okay\ni actually barely know it i know it's\nit's i mean i yeah\nwhich is what i'm trying to get to which\ni'm trying to get to because i think a\nlot of people will assume like you work\nat microsoft you you work with a lot of\nazure related things you have to know c\nsharp and this is what i was trying to\nlike start start the conversation around\nis\nyou can know different languages work\nwith different languages and find\nopportunities to do that oh yeah it's\nnot a requirement i mean i use a mac\nalso\nsomething a lot of people are like the\namount of people that ask\nyeah a lot of people that ask like oh is\nit taboo to use a mac\nor um are you allowed to ask for a\ndifferent type of computer instead of\nservice and i'm like i think the\nmajority of people i won't say the\nmajority of people prefer it but i'm the\nbut most of my colleagues\ni think have max i'm sort of the one\nthat's on a thinkpad on windows just\nbecause it's my preference not because\nwe have to of course\nyeah but i i a lot of it's like oh yeah\ni get a lot of questions like oh yeah\nyou need to know.net i need to know c\nsharp or powershell\num enabled i don't do i don't power snow\neither\nno powershell no no i mean\nmy role is customer facing i haven't\nreally gotten to that yet and so if a\ncustomer needs help with something\nthen i'll help them with that we're just\nwe're meeting them where they are i'm\nnot going to be like oh oh dotnet i\ncan't don't you want to use node or or\nwhatever no so i'll just you know but\nit's not something i'm strongest and\ni'll probably have to reach out to one\nof my teammates and be like hey can you\nhop in on this part\nyeah okay that's awesome and i think\nanother thing i wanted to ask you is you\nknow it looks like you've gone through a\ncouple of languages and you become\ncomfortable with them was it it's i'm\nassuming it was easier like from your\nfirst one that you picked up to you know\nnow you could pick up anything and it\nyou know your onboarding process is\nprobably yeah appreciate it\ni think that was part of a benefit of\nfinishing school too because and this is\nreally like a style of learning thing\nbecause going to class having that\nenvironment having deadlines that really\nhelped me to focus\num and i kind of need that now again\nearlier in career i could just pick up a\nbook and learn something and go do it\nand i was better at focusing i'm not\nvery good at it now and so i kind of\nneed more structure and that became the\ncase more and more over the years so if\nthat's the way you learn that it might\nhelp to go back to school if you're a\ngood self-learner if you're somebody who\ncan read blogs and books and focus and\npush code to github and learn it that\nway then\nmaybe you don't need that classroom\nstructure you can do an online class or\nsomething yeah but going back to school\nhelped because i also too i think i got\nthe\ncomputer science foundations that way\nbecause if you're if you're just\nteaching yourself something you're going\nto pick up like a how to java in 30 days\nbook right yeah you're not going to pick\nup a design patterns book and that's\nsomething if you're learning java and\nacademic environment it's going to be\nvery design patterns heavy and then as\nyou're going through other people's code\nyou can kind of say like oh they're\nusing the command pattern here okay this\nmakes sense\nlike that kind of stuff because java\ndevelopers just love their patterns\nand yes\nyes\nso i think that those foundations do\nhelp there i you know i took a lot of\ndatabase foundations courses that come\nup now occasionally i can just like\nthrow out a big word on a customerbut\nyeah i mean but that i but you know\neverybody's journey is different\nobviously my journey is like\nyou know but i know people that they\njust they knew what they wanted to do\nthey went to school they got a cs degree\nin four years and\nthey went from there um other people\nit's it's it's different we have\ndifferent perspectives which is great\ndo you\ndo you ever wish you could go back to to\nthat helpdesk software that you wrote\nand rewrite it with everything that you\nknow now\nwouldn't it be a cool project yeah well\nto be honest it would be a power app\nand i would be done with it in five\nminutes\nokay you know\nreally because i mean it was an access\ndatabase and it had it had some forms\nand queries and all that\nbut yeah it was an internal only app\nand it had a sql server database i think\nultimately first it was an access\ndatabase but then i learned sql server\nand connected it to that i don't know\nwho gave me and helped us access to the\nsql server but\nanyway\num\nso yeah i mean really yeah i do now\nwould be powerapp it'd be a really\nsimple one too and it would\nactually probably probably better but\nfun fact they only just let go of my app\nlike five years ago it spent 20 years in\nproduction what\nyeahyeah i still talk to the people i worked\nwith there and they're like oh yeah we\nthey just decided to sunset the help\ndesk app you know a couple years ago and\ni'm like say what\nso\nand she said yeah you know an access\ndatabase it would get to like 40 000\nrecords or so and it would slow down and\nwe would copy all those records into\nanother database and then we would you\nknow we would give ruin an hour to down\ntime where we copied the records out and\nthen start over\nthat's\nthat's quite the accomplishment for a\nhelp desk\nside\nproject\nyeah yeah that's right that's awesome\nyeah\nso\num\nthat's how i got into cloud as well at\nmy helpdesk gig because i had like some\ndown time\nand i would just hang out with the\ninfrastructure team just kind of\nwatching what they were doing\nuh and then one day someone was like you\nshould get an aws certification and then\nyou know i'm well a couple years and\nthings more things happen but that's how\ni ended up here but yeah help desk i\nyou i wouldn't say the requirements are\nlow\nbecause\ni don't think they are but it's a very\nentry-level friendly gig\nand for people who like you know with\nnon-traditional backgrounds and you know\ni think it's just such an interesting\nfirst step because the amount of things\nlike it's very high level but the amount\nof like tech that you could potentially\nget exposed to and people because you\ncould be like in my i guess it obviously\ndepends on the size of the company but\nin my case i was working with everyone\nfrom uh people on my team up to the cfo\ncto ceo and sometimes i would just have\nlike casual conversations and then you\nknow that's networking as well\nbut anyway big big fan of help desk\nbut back to your story\nso you know you get into\nyeah\nwe get you get into you know\nweb and you say that's what you ended up\nwanting to do more of when was your\nfirst\nsort of adventure with serverless and\nwhen were you like oh i want this is\nsomething i want to\ndive deeper into\nsure so i guess it's been\nmaybe eight to ten years ago that i\nstarted with this this startup was like\na ten person startup and the idea was\nthat we would go to various companies\nand just help them fix problems\nso we might help them like let's say\nthey have a lot of people that like\ndevelopers and they need to inspire\ndevelopers we would bring in robots and\nteach them iot\nand we would teach them javascript and\nthe reason that we were so javascript\nheavy is we felt like it helped to\ndemocratize coding basically we felt\nlike javascript was really easy to learn\nthat both the front end and the back end\ndevelopers could could use it if you use\nnode.js so everyone you know sort of\nacross all the various groups were using\nthe same language we would use node with\nnodebots for iot\nand we would just basically go in\ninspire the employees get everybody\nexcited\ngo through all the existing code and say\nlike oh this don't do this use this use\nthis start to talk to them about cloud\nit was pretty exciting and so in order\nto to stay on top of things in order to\nbe like these advisors we would have to\nknow all the latest stuff coming out so\nwe would have these\nlike smaller projects and so basically\nthe cto of the company was like hey i\nthink there's really like a thing here\nwith\nserverless and aws lambda you know and\nthat was kind of before\nthat was kind of like the first real\nfast that had kind of come out and so\nyou know so he was like can you explore\nthis so i put together a project it was\naws iot\nand some like i think aws recognition\nwhen it was super super brand new\nlambda and like that was my first real\nproject and so i put together this um\ndetection system with a raspberry pi\nand i had to write the lambdas for that\num and then i was like oh this is super\neasy like this is great i'm writing like\nso little code here\nand\nlike it's so little code that there's\nlike less troubleshooting i just like\npushed this and it worked and\ni was i was hooked\ni was basically hooked because everyone\nelse in the company was very deep in\ncontainers and kubernetes and it was\ngetting very infra heavy and i felt like\ni was losing the development part of it\nbecause i was spending so much time\nworrying about\nyou know\nwhere my container was\nand so i was like oh i don't have to\ncare about where my container is i just\nlike i push this and it works and then i\nstarted thinking more about it a little\nmore deeply like okay\nwell how does this now work if i have\nthis new tool like how do i chain things\ntogether how do i do it safely because\nnow\ni need now i need guard rails okay i did\nit it's easy\nnow i need guardrails okay so how do i\nintroduce my\nwinter where's my cicd process\nlike things like that immediately i went\nback to my roots of like okay this was\nfun this is great i pushed a bunch of\nstuff but yeah how do i like lock it\nback down and so that's kind of then\nthat became my obsession so so you were\nalready happy well i guess not happy but\nexcited with developing with serverless\ntools and such\nback then\nwhere i i can't imagine how that process\nlooked like back then because even now\nthere's still somewhat of a struggle\nwith things like debugging things like\nsecurity right in the service lan and i\ncan't imagine\nwhat that had been like when things were\njust getting started when aws\nso when you got started was it only\nlambda like that's the only fast around\nyeah that was kind of what existed and\nthen then i think ibm had something and\nthen of course actual functions okay\nyeah because it ibm uh bluemix and so\nwhat i did is and that's that's also too\nbecause my the startup i worked for\nwould had no\nlike alliances with any particular cloud\nwe were cloud agnostic\num and so we really had to kind of know\nevery cloud and so that so then i\nstarted saying okay i built this on aws\nbut what does it look like in ibm cloud\nwas it like on google cloud what does it\nlook like on\nmicrosoft um and so then i was doing a\nlot of talks about\nserverless in general and like the good\nand bad of each platform and so\ni was putting together this talk that\nwas like what's under the hood like what\nactually happens in each cloud platform\nfor serverless and so i went out and i\nstarted interviewing people from each\ncloud and saying okay what's the good\nbad and ugly like what is what's\nactually happening here and when i\ntalked to microsoft to jeff holland at\nthe time\njeff was like who i mean i love jeff\njeff is great and i the first time i met\nhim first of all he stood up in a like a\nmeeting right away like he had no idea\nwho i was and i'm like hey hi\ni'm a person and can i talk to you about\nazure functions like how they actually\nwork and he's like sure when do you want\nto meet this is great and so anyway he\nshowed me kind of how the runtimes were\nopen source\nand about how you could containerize\nthings and i was just like this is cool\nthis just feels like the future where\nserverless is not a black box okay but\nyeah you can push code to an azure\nfunction and it works but also\nyou can kind of dig in a little deeper\nand then you can kind of like go out and\nlook at the docker containers and you\ncan kind of see what's happening and\nthen you can kind of understand how it\nworks and then once i get into that then\ni was like oh wait\nlogic gaps like i don't think you know\nno one really has anything that's quite\nlike this and now this is low code and\nit's like building blocks and lego\nblocks but it's still serverless you\nknow event grid that was also super\nnew and that was so anyway i guess i got\nstarted to get really really into the\nmicrosoft platform yeah that's when i\nstarted building more on azure functions\nso\ndoes advocacy and i don't necessarily\nmean\nyou know having the role advocate in in\nyour title but this advocacy and getting\ninto service for you kind of go hand in\nhand so it seems like as you were\nfiguring these things out you know\ndiving into it more and more you were\nalso like giving talks and whatnot but\nand i'm sure with these events and\nwhatnot that you were doing\nyou you got to hear a lot of different\nopinions on people's you know people's\nopinions on serverless and i'm curious\nwhat did you have you seen that change\nor was that like was it drastically\ndifferent when you started to where it\nis now\num\nso\nthe serverless community is interesting\nand\ni actually got into the community\nbecause so first of all i am\njust by nature somewhat introverted i\ndon't just naturally sign up and go i\njust love to talk i love to give talks\nit's a little bit of a struggle i still\nget very stressed out about it but i do\nlike to teach\nand i also i hate gatekeeping i hate\nbarriers i i want like everyone to have\nthe same opportunity\nand so i also know that i represent a\nyou know a group of people that's not\nyou know prevalent in our industry and\nmy background is super weird and so i\nwant to evangelize that and say hey look\nwhere i am like literally anybody can be\nwhere i am i should not have ever gotten\nthat first health desk job that i did i\nwas so completely not qualified for it\nbut you know i thought and got it um\nand so that was important to me and also\ntoo and i worked for the startup i think\nto the cto that startup was just like\nbasically like the parent that pushes\ntheir kid in the deep end he was like oh\nyou don't feel comfortable talking too\nbad\ni booked your flight to san jose you're\nspeaking at this conference you know so\nthat was helpful too to have a have good\nmentors and people to sort of build me\nup and kind of push me out\nand i felt like okay now i need to be\nthat person and also start helping other\npeople\num but\nyou know just sort of a shout out to\nlike the\na cloud guru people because they gave me\na free ticket to the serverless\nconference austin i said talk that's\nawesome\nmy talk was terrible that i submitted\nbut then they reached out and they were\nlike hey it's great you seem to just\ntalk what if we give you a ticket\nso then i booked like an airbnb went to\naustin met and met so many people in\nthat community\nand then everyone was so great and it\nwas very welcoming and you know\neverybody just was it was very inclusive\nand yeah there were arguments but even\nthe arguments between people were not\nhateful it was like it was like a\nlearning kind of argument even the\npeople that completely disagreed on\nlanguages or definition of serverless it\nwas still it was like we were still so\nseparated away from the people who were\nvery focused on kubernetes that\neven if we disagreed we still had this\none thing in common\nand so i love i still love the\nserverless community um and i loved i\nthink i spoke at three serverless comps\nplus some other you know random\nconferences so\nyou know a lot of these talks are still\nout there if anybody wants to do some\ngoogling or whatever i will definitely\ncheck them out and then i'll have them\ni'll have a couple of links for the next\nstream to share with the chat and\nwhatnot but i want to talk now about\nwhat you do at microsoft\nmaybe\nmaybe for what you do at microsoft let's\nlet's\ndive into how you\nstarted with us\nor i guess here with us sounds weird but\nat microsoft um\nwas it yeah you know tell me a little\nbit about that was like that role and to\nget to where we're at and then we can\ndive in to where you're at now\nsure um so i've basically been on the\nsales side since i joined microsoft um\nmy very first manager at microsoft saw\none of my talks on linkedin\nlike he went to my linkedin profile\nwatched some of the videos i had posted\nthere and basically thought okay like\nshe could do pre-sales and we want to\nget some people in on the team that kind\nof know\nyou know other cloud platforms in\naddition to\nmicrosoft platform and so yeah so anyway\nhe uh he put me in the process to\nto interview you know got me to apply\nand\ngot the job my first role was a tsp\nwhich is um like a it doesn't exist\nanymore but it's like just a totally\npre-sales\nyou know position so basically like just\nhelping on the technical side so if a\ncustomer comes to us and says like hey i\njust really need help with like what\nknowing what what logic apps is and\nthat's where i would come in and kind of\nshow them a little demo and and talk\nabout talk through um and then um i got\nshipped around a little bit and then i\nended up in\nmy role now\ntwo years ago yeah two years ago okay\nwhich is the\nglobal black belt team\nwhich is to me the coolest roll out\ntheir global black belt\nand\ni would love to know more about your\nday-to-day\nas well\nwhat was the total so how long have you\nbeen at microsoft for total\num almost\nlike maybe three and a half years now\nokay okay yeah that's kind of still\nrecent i guess i don't i don't really\nknow because people don't really stick\naround roles\npretty long so i feel like now\nit it might seem like a forever time but\nlike you know a couple years ago would\nhave been like oh wow you're just\ngetting started or whatnot but okay so\nnow your global black belt\nwould love to know your day-to-day would\nlove to know how often you use\nserverless in your role now or and then\ni want to talk about\ngetting started in serverless for people\nin chat\nyeah sure\num so i will say one really cool thing\nabout working for microsoft this has\nbeen true for for pretty much every team\ni've worked for is that if you work in a\nteam your manager isn't like okay well\nyou'll be on my team forever you know\nyeah so plan that they're always like\nwhat's what's your next step\nwhat are you gonna do after you leave\nthis team and you're like no i like it\nhere i'm going to stand like okay that's\ngreat but what are you going to do next\nlike you know they like really within\nmicrosoft everybody's thinking about\ntheir future people that's why people\nmove around it's not because they hate\ntheir teams but it's because as you grow\nand learn you're kind of like well\nactually i think i would be better on\nthis team\nand then you know so really like on my\nteam it's more\ndeeply focused so whereas the rules i\nwas in before was a little bit more\nbroad so really it was everything\nactive whereas my background was more on\nthe serverless side and on the\nintegrations side so like you know api\nmanagement logic apps like those types\nof services your service bus so i was\nalways kind of thinking about event\ndriven architectures and fasts and so\nbecause i think i had a deeper knowledge\nthere it made more sense to come to the\nblack belt team where\nit's still pre-sales\nit's still i'm still talking to\ncustomers all the time but it's more at\na deeper level like if they really want\nto dig in super deep they want to know\nabout durable functions they want to\nknow about how azure functions works in\ntheir architecture if they want to think\nabout sort of like some\nthey want to go over an architecture and\nthink kind of big picture and really dig\nin deep that's more\nmy team we're kind of about sort of\nhelping them with their technical\ndecision\nokay are you\nstill like are you building demos in\nthose kinds of things or is it more like\na discussion yes sometimes it just it\nkind of depends on what what they need\nsometimes it's really like if it's a\nfunctions conversation it might be that\nit's just not working as expected\nor they just don't understand how it\npieces together because there's a lot of\nterms there and they're like okay well\nwhat's the difference between okay i've\ngot a service bus and i've got an event\ngrid and i've got an event hubs like\nwhat are they what's the difference\nbetween them how do i use them when do i\nput a function in there when does a\nfunction not make sense then whenever i\nwant a container app like those are\nthose are the types of questions that we\njust we don't always answer in our\ndocumentation right and so having\ntalking to like a real person to kind of\nhelp you through that um and we do put\ntogether examples demos pocs sort of\nillustrate the point i think\num you know but i think i use functions\na lot\num i don't always have a lot of\ndiscussions specifically on functions\nit's usually a bigger architecture that\nfunctions just happens to be a part of\nyeah um i also work a lot with low code\nso in like the sort of low code fusion\narchitectures where you've got a power\napp that you want to connect to an api\nthen it makes sense to use functions\nthere because\nfunctions is sort of the\nit's sort of the lowest you know\nfunctions are logic apps sort of the\nlowest code place you can go in azure so\nif you're if you're really comfortable\nin something like powerapps but you're\nlike okay i want to go bigger i want to\nconnect i want to create now an api\nand i want to connect to that from my\npowerapp how do i do that and so then\nyou know then we can have a good\nfunctions conversation and like how to\nset up a function and\nyou know pick your link pick your\nlanguage any language and\nwe'll support you and you know show you\nhow to turn that into an api\nso do\nyou\nit's interesting you mentioned like the\npick your language thing so is it your\nis your part of your role to kind of\njust be flexible and be able to do\nwhatever it is that the customer needs\nlike you're not like oh this isn't\njavascript that's i can't help you out\nno yeah no never yeah i mean i don't\nknow i barely know python at all and one\nof my customers is is very python heavy\nand one of my teammates helps out a lot\nwith like various python specific issues\nbut a lot of things are\nare pretty generic across functions and\nso and the process is the same so\nyeah and actually they've taught me\nquite a bit about python working with\nthem\ni've got i've got a couple of fun\nquestions that i would like to ask and\nthen we can dive into the how to getting\nstarted with serverless but if you were\nto recommend a programming language for\nsomeone who wanted to get started in\njust current day they want to learn how\nto code and kickstart their career what\nlanguage would that be\nyeah i would say javascript still\njavascript okay interesting yeah okay\nokay i i usually get python when i ask\nthat\nbut i guess it definitely yeah that's\nprobably because i don't know python\nokay fair yeah\nbecause i just that that wasn't a path i\nwent down um and i know in a lot of a\nlot of academic programs python is like\nthe intro to program is python but for\nme it was c and then i think visual\nmaybe\nyeah vbscript or something okay\ni think the one thing that javascript\ni would say is sort of like a a benefit\nis with it being web you can instantly\nkind of see what you're doing\nand i think when you're getting started\nlike\nsort of grasping like back-end\ndevelopment and things like that it's\nmore difficult especially if you like a\nvisual learning but i i personally don't\nknow\nany javascript i don't dislike it or\nanything like that it's kind of a like\njoke but i say i'll never learn\njavascript but it's more so i just\nthat's what i say about.net\nhow far can i go at microsoft with never\nreally learning.net yeah well you know\nnow there's things like blazer and\nwhatnot so you could do like front end\nas well right but this you know it's at\nthe end of the day there's still some\njavascript in there anyway but okay\ninteresting now\nanother thing i found cool that you\nmentioned was you had an aws background\nended up here at microsoft\nand\nobviously we're we have azure different\ncloud platform right did you feel like\nwhat you knew with aws translated well\ninto kind of grabbing and getting\nstarted with azure here\noh yeah definitely yeah i mean it is\ndifferent and honestly the um the fast\nproducts across\nclouds used to be a lot more similar i\nthink because i used to i used to use\nserverless framework a lot and i used to\njust deploy to all of them kind of using\nthe same\nyou know i'm actually wearing a\nserverless\nt-shirt today\nand uh and so\nit was they were all they were all kind\nof look more similar every they've\ndiverged a lot sort of just based on\npriorities and how they interact with\nsort of other services within the cloud\nand things but if i i still have stuff\nrunning on aws um i still i mean i have\nsome early early twitter bots\nand i've been running on lambda for\nyears i don't even think about it they\ncost me no money so i just don't even\nlike think about it it's the same thing\nwith logic apps i have some very old\nlogic apps that are just doing what a\nprocess is for me they've been sitting\nout there kind of forever but yeah i\nthink that i think it really helped just\nhaving the basis in any cloud platform i\nthink you know it helped me\nyou know and it's not any um\nyou know i guess and that's the sort of\nthe great thing about the serverless\ncommunity though too\num that community is pretty agnostic\nyeah you know you would see you know aws\ngoogle and and azure people hanging out\ntogether at the happy hour after\nserverlessconf you know so it's really\nmore about the philosophy than the\nspecific\nfast service so yeah the transition\nwasn't wasn't hard for me i kind of\nbasically understood it's interesting to\nhear that they used to be more similar\nthan they are now i didn't know that but\nthen my career in cloud is relatively\nnew but that's cool to know dude do you\nand i agree with the like this like\nserverless sort of that space is more so\ni see them more focusing on building\ntools or frameworks\nthat work on top of all clouds like you\nknow like serverless framework whatnot\num\nvery cool i i want to dive into\nif you were to want to like learnnow is there like so what tools would\nyou recommend or is there a project that\nyou recommend or how what would that\njourney look like\nin 2022\num\nso\ni'm going to go down the azure path\nbasically and say i would\num\ni'd use our i use azure's like our learn\nplatform basically and you mentioned the\ncloud skills challenge i think that's a\ngood a good starting place to start with\nlearn.microsoft.com\ngo down the functions path\nfrom there it can lead you in other\ndirections\nyou know maybe get on the logic apps\npath\num but you can get from zero to having\nsomething deployed pretty quickly i\nthink through the learn path so that's\nthat's what i how i would go\num\ni think too i mean you know i know that\nlike\nthere's a lot of community stuff out\nthere too and i know that you know like\nwhen you were involved in kind of like\nthe azure like the functions like\nuniversity and some of the other\nprojects yeah like yeah there's there's\na lot of that stuff out there that's\nreally good i mean obviously the content\nfor serverless september for like even\nthe last few years\num all of that's good i still i did we\nhad like a holiday one a couple years\nago too where it was like like the 25\ndays of serverless 25 days of serverless\nyes yeah i still go back and look at all\nmy solutions because i was like wait i\ndid a solution like this years ago and\ni'll go back and look at it you know\nbecause i think i was pushing something\nto\nblob and then doing something else and i\nwas like let me just go find my code i\nwrote before\num and then i had pushed at the github\nbut\nyeah that's kind of how i would get\nstarted um\ni think within our docs there's a lot of\ngood quick starts too\nso if you're somebody who you like just\nread the docs i think you could read the\ndocs go through the quick starts\nas well but i would say to try to push\nsome code as quickly as possible like\ndon't get analysis paralysis and feel\nlike oh well\ni really need to like know the inner\nworkings of this super super well just\npick a language\nand say i'm doing this language go find\nthe docs and just push something\nand then you'll get that immediate\nresult like that immediate hello world\nyou'd be like oh i'm now a serverless\ndeveloper\nwhere do i go from here\nyeah the the especially like creating a\nfunction i remember creating a function\nin the portal\nthree years ago three or four years ago\nand you know you can when it creates one\nfor you can instantly go into the\nin portal editor you hit run and then\nyou have the hello welcome azure\nfunctions message or maybe it was a\ndifferent message back then i can't\nremember\num\nand i was like whoa\nit's\nyeah obviously it's a very simple api\nbut it it's already fully running and\nwhat was interesting with my sort of\njourney into serverless was i didn't\nhave any\ntraditional talk\ndevelopment like i wasn't like building\nstuff to run like like desktop apps on\nlike virtual machines or anything like\nthat my first introduction in like in a\nproduction kind of um like in work like\nwhere i was getting paid for was through\nazure functions um\nso when people ask me now like oh hey\nlike i want to learn programming like is\nserver looks like a way that i could\nsort of like approach it could i build\nprojects and\nwhat's that and i'm like absolutely for\nprojects like\nwe all know forest brazil big fan um the\ncloud resume challenge is\nthe cloud resume challenge is a a\nproject that i recommend anybody who\nwants to get into cloud\nto do\nand you're\nback\nin this and you know if that's your\nfirst introduction to programming you're\ndeploying a serverless application\nwhether that be functions whether it be\nlambda\ni can't remember what the gcp one is um\ni want to say it's like cloud functions\nor something like that the name of\ngoogle cloud's uh fast yeah um\nbut it's cool that now it's sort of a\nway where like oh if you want to become\na service developer and that you want\nthat to be your first thing it could\nvery much be like your first thing\nuh i don't know if you have any like\nthings for people to look out\nyeah i love what you're suggesting what\nyou've suggested a few times where like\nyou were mentioning the cloud skills\nchallenge or even though the what the\nheck and saying okay you can put this on\nyour resume i love that idea yeah put\nsome stuff in github\nlike if you do these samples put them on\nlike try to get them all in github try\nto learn how to you know push to github\ni would say also vs code vs code is your\nfriend yes vs code you have i mean you\ncan use vs code for any of the cloud\nplatforms so even if you don't go down\nthe azure functions road you go down a\nlambda or you know a google cloud road\nyou can you can actually just use the\nextensions for vs code for any of those\nas well so like if i'm working on a\nfunctions app but then i'm like oh i\nneed to update this\nlambda or whatever i just i i stay in vs\ncode the whole time\nand so and then you can also push to\ngithub from vs code\nso\nthat that's that's another thing and\nthen like yeah like you're saying\nthink of it all as like projects that\nyou you know link them put them on\ngithub link them on your linkedin put\nthem on twitter hey i did this this cool\nthing and for the most part\nmost part you'll have a lot of cool\npeople like when saying hey that's a\nreally cool project i love that i mean i\nhave a lot of just zany stuff on my\ngithub i've had very few\nbad\nyou know actors that have you know made\ncomments very few for the most part i've\nhad\ngood people encouraging me and then good\npeople telling the actors to take a hike\nyeah no i think for me it's been like\nthat too i remember actually that 25\ndays of serverless that you mentioned\nwas the first sort of\ni guess challenge that i kind of\ninteracted with microsoft cloud\nadvocates and this was back in 2019 and\nmy my entire experience was like wow\neveryone's like so so helpful and so\nnice and so supportive so now it's kind\nof my turn to give back if anyone is out\nthere posting solutions and whatnot if\nyou use the hashtag serverlessseptember\ni'm gonna be able to find it showcase it\nhelp you out answer any questions and\nwhatnot um so you know get on that i\nthink it's it's it's great to get hands\non and whatnot and i think as advice i\nthink you mentioned this but\ndon't get stuck\nand like all these decisions\nand all these things that you could\npotentially like oh should i do this\nshould i do that should i do this the\ncool like you mentioned the cool thing\nabout servers it's one of the easiest\nsort of spaces in cloud to like if you\nhave an idea implement it in maybe try\nlambda and and\nuh i don't know python and then maybe\ntry functions with node or then try a\ndifferent cloud with a different\nlanguage like your goal is to more so\nyou know figure out that yeah you can\nbuild these things the tool doesn't\nreally matter because like linda\nmentioned you might end up on a team\nwhere it's not about the language it's\nnot about the tool it's about you being\nable to present these solutions to\ncustomers and if you're so stuck on like\none specific stack you're probably going\nto limit yourself\nright\nyeah i think so\nyeah i mean don't be don't be afraid\nabout you know being don't don't try to\nbe perfect\ni mean that's that's a great thing i\nmean you can there's so many guard rails\nreally i think with any of the fast\nservices and when serverless in general\nyou can get something working\nreally quickly and then once it's\nworking then you can start thinking\nabout okay how to make this better how\ndo i add on other services how do i how\ndo i do more\nbut you can get something up really\nquickly and you get that immediate like\nfeel good\nyeah when you when you deploy something\nand you like you go to the portal and\nyou click on the link and it's like you\nknow your\napplication is running it's like oh\ngreat great\nyeah\nabsolutely before we end i want to go\nthrough the chat um because i just got\nlost in the conversation and see if\nthere's anything\nthat we we can answer\nuh or we give some shout outs here\nuh let me go to the top here let me grab\nsome but yeah the chat's been very\nactive so\nuh i appreciate that from everyone here\nboris is saying hey hey boris jj saying\nhello hello\nivana's here as well thank you everyone\nfor for hanging out and saying hi\nsomeone said shots each time not gonna\nendorse that but i think this was when i\nsaid you know\nmake a tally for each time we say\nserverless\nyeah yeah we should have said drink some\nwater yeah oh yeah i would have been\nvery hydrated\nabsolutely um\nlooks like we got someone tuning in from\ntexas that is awesome\nand let's scroll down here oh we got\nsomeone else saying hey that's awesome\nlet me see someone says here 21 years\nwith the same company i'm a dinosaur\ni would say\neveryone's journey is completely their\nown and if you feel like you're happy at\na place and you don't want to leave why\nwould you leave right don't let anyone\nelse's i mean and that doesn't dictate\nwhat you do in your free time too and\nexactly\nyeah exactly i mean yeah like my journey\nobviously i was all over the place but i\nspent\nmore than 10 years in government you\nknow and sort of like public sector\nand so and a lot of people are like oh i\ndon't i hate public sector it's not\ninnovative but i did a lot of like\nreally cool innovative stuff and i had\nthe opportunity to go back to school and\nthat sort of thing too yeah when i\nworked for the government so\num yeah everyone's everyone's different\nyeah i i like what you said there that\nit doesn't dictate what you do in your\nfree time you could always learn\nsomething new do something else on your\nfree time\num absolutely love that let's see is\nthere any course for python yes there is\na lot of python content on ms learn\nthere's like there's dot-net there's\npython i know there's rust there's\njavascript\nuh what else is on there\na bunch more everyone must check that\nout\nms learn is and i know\ni'm biased but i really think it is an\nunderrated\ntool for learning because it's guided\nlearning and i know you realize early on\nthat\nsort of having something guide you along\nthat like school curriculums do is\nreally helpful for some people and ms\nlearn\nhas that for like a bunch of different\nthings so be sure to check that out um\npeople are thanking us now vana says\nthank you\nuh\nsaying thank you as well\ngreat shame i think this was awesome\nlinda thank you so much uh we're at\nabout time here yeah it's so great\ntalking to you and yeah i mean people\ncan find us on\ntwitter and you know occasionally on\nlinkedin i don't answer my linkedin\nmessages but you can tag me i'll see it\nwell make sure to drop your twitter and\nthe yeah in my github i mean you can\neverything\nthere's all kinds of\nstuff on there\ntoo so oh here's one last thing i want\nto add here there will be a serverless\nguide for getting started with functions\nfor python out in the next couple of\ndays for serverless september awesome\nno better time than this this is awesome\nmaybe i will do it and i'll learn python\nthere we go\nthat's awesome uh but yes uh linda thank\nyou so much i don't know this is a\nquestion for our production team i don't\nknow if we want to throw something up at\nthe end of this stream sometimes they do\nsometimes they have like the survey\nthing or not\nbut if so\nfeel free to throw that up now if not\nwe're going to say bye and\nsign off and thank everyone i will be\nback live\nnext thursday at the same time with more\nserverless what am i talking about next\nweek i can't remember i think it might\nbe the project that got me promoted that\nwas a serverless project or i have one\nwith my colleague liam where we're\ntalking about devops and serverless it's\none of those but this month is packed\nwith serverless stuff here at the\nreactor so be sure to stay tuned and\nthat's it linda thank you so much for\nhanging out and i will see you in the\nnext one great time all right see ya bye\neverybody",
