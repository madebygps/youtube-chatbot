  "transcript": "hi everyone welcome to a new video it's\ngonna be a little bit different this\nisn't a tutorial or a study notes so if\nyou interested in that skip to the next\nvideo or don't watch this one if this is\nmore of a life update kind of thing I\nwant to do reflect on the journey of how\nI actually got into the cloud\nengineering space and my background is a\nlittle different as you see the title I\nhad no experience I had no degree I\nstill don't have a degree and going into\nthe field so I figured if anyone else is\nout there and they kind of find\nthemselves in a very similar situation\nproviding a little bit of transparency\nand insight into how I got into it might\nbe able to enable you I've broken it\ndown into five sort of tips three are\nfor getting actually into the field and\nthen two are once you are in the field\nwhat could enable you to take the next\nstep or take different risks and such so\nthe first one is going to be try to lean\non resources that you already have a lot\nof people are in already like a\ndeveloper role helpdesk role a sysadmin\nrole and networking role and want to\nmove into cloud sometimes at the places\nthat you are already in they'll have\nsomeone who is working on cloud maybe\nthere's an infrastructure team maybe\nthere's a cloud engineering team already\nsee if you could maybe like negotiate\nsome downtime with your supervisor maybe\nyou can get an hour a week to just see\nwhat they're working on and it's like\nthe cloud seems to be what the cloud\nteam is working on I was at I helped\nthis job it was like an entry-level\nhelpdesk job and I when I had downtime I\nwas able to sort of shadow any team I\nwanted to and my only interest really\nwas the infrastructure team because I\ngot along with them and they were moving\nsome stuff into AWS so they allowed me\nto really see what was going on\nthat led me to getting AWS certified\nwhich I would also recommend doing get\ncertified in whatever cloud platform you\nwant to become certified in and I got\nkind of an introduction to how it works\nthanks to certification and thanks to\nbeing exposed to AWS with this team then\nthis rules into my second tip which is\nwiden the pool of areas that you are\napplying to everyone wants to work at\nFacebook in Google in Amazon and\nMicrosoft and Apple and those are great\nif that's your goal definitely go for it\nbut that was completely off the table\nfor me because I didn't have a degree I\ndon't have a degree I I didn't even go\nto high school here I was living in\nSouth America I did two semesters there\nI dropped out of school and moves back\nto to the States so I barely had any\nwork experience really on paper\nso I was like all right let me try to go\nfor these smaller mid-sized companies\nmaybe a little work better for me and I\nheard back from a lot of these I will\nsay that I was sort of at a time where\ngetting certified and getting at the\ncloud computing was still very very\nniche so this was about three or four\nyears ago\nso yeah I had that going for me but\ndefinitely applying to smaller mid-sized\ncompanies worked well for me and I feel\nlike it's a little less competitive and\nthey're a lot lighter on what\nrequirements you need to even get into\nthe field and what se experience you\nneed and sometimes they're willing to\ntake a bigger risk on people just\nbecause they need Talent\nso yeah give that a try my third tip is\nbe open to what roles you're going for\nmaybe not your next step isn't\nnecessarily a cloud engineering\ncomputing role but maybe it's like cloud\nadjacent like it'll give you exposure\ninto it I know for me I help desk job\ngot certified and then I was applying to\nroles I was applying a bunch of cloud\nrolls but I was also playing - any roles\nthat would give me exposure to cloud and\nI landed on the role that I'm in now\nwell the company that I'm in now where\nthere it was a sysadmin role obviously\nwould have to do sysadmin and some IT\nstuff but IT Help Desk things but they\nalso mentioned in the bullet points\nthere and in the pith in the listing is\nif you have any interest in cloud we're\ncurrently migrating and you'll have\nexposures to that as well so for my\nhighlight I landed the job I actually\ndid like really well in the interview\nand that could be a whole video on\nitself but I you know did Welling\ninterview I landed the job and then for\nthe first year I was not only taking\ncare of all the roles them I all the\ntasks on my roles\ndefined but also I was volunteering to\nbe on any additional project that would\ngive me exposure to cloud and I remember\nworking a lot like that lot that year or\ntime on the weekends obviously I'm in a\nprivileged position where I don't have\nkids depending on me or like a partner\nor anything depending on me so I really\nhad all my time to myself and I wouldn't\nnecessarily say it was a healthy\nbehavior because I remember gaining like\na lot of weight and being anxious but I\nlearned so much and I got so much\nexposure and and sometimes there's that\nsacrifice that you do have to make in\norder to make the next up in your life\nso that was definitely worth it but I\nwould have not landed in that position\nor not gotten exposure if it weren't for\nme\nopen to not necessarily landing a cloud\nrole but getting into a role that would\nget me there eventually and that leads\ninto my what is this fourth tip well I\nguess this is kind of like the same is\nsometimes you don't need to move the\ncompany sometimes you can move up\neventually I was promoted into a clown\nengineering role but that happened\nwithin the same the same company so that\nmight be a possibility too\nmy fourth tip is once you're in your\nrole and this is I guess for any rolling\nany and not specific to engineering is\nbe smart with your money I was never\nlike literate when it came to personal\nfinance up until a couple of years ago\nwhere I started making some money enough\nto save and I was like maybe just saving\nisn't enough so I started learning about\nlike retirement accounts and investing\nin stuff like that and you know now I'm\nin a position where if I take risks I\nhave a great cushion to catch me in case\nI become unemployed or something or I\nstop making money but yeah that's kind\nof just like that's more like a life tip\nbut I would say just because sometimes\nthese engineering roles come with\nsalaries that are pretty big yeah it'd\nbe smart with your money that's number\nfour\nand number five also is like once you do\nland your role lean on your community to\ncontinue to educate yourself I'm not\ntelling you to be studying constantly\nevery single day learn every single new\ntool but be in the know stay updated\nyou know chat with other people who are\nin the field or chat with other newbies\nor chat with other professionals\nwhatever it feels work feels good for\nyou utilize things like LinkedIn and\nsocial media in general are great ways\nto tapping into the community but\nnetwork and and you'll never know what\nopportunities come from that I speak\nfrom my own personal experience I\ntweeted about this as well as like since\nstarting this channel I've built an\namazing network and so many\nopportunities have popped up for me in\norder to say take a next step of maybe\nbeing employed as a college and you're\ndoing it completely on my own which is a\nstep that I'm taking at the moment so\nyou'll never know what comes from\nnetworking and building yeah those words\nthose are my five I guess bullet points\nus too\nhow to get into the field and once\nyou're into the field how to keep\ngrowing don't be afraid to go for it\napply for apply for anything really I I\napplied to a lot of things and I got\nrejected to a bunch of things but you\nknow becoming comfortable with rejection\nis a skill set on its own so go for it\njust go for it um anyway reach out to me\non Twitter if you'd like to chat or if\nyou need to talk about really how you\nknow some struggles or anything really\nhundreds of cloud is still going on I\nthink I mentioned that in my previous\nvideo if you are looking to get hands-on\nwith a couple of projects or the\ncommunity or talk to us we're over 230\nmembers now and you know we're dialing\nthe code of conduct right now to make\nsure it's a safe and open environment\nfor everyone and you have my word that\nI'm fully fully committed to that and\nit's an open source project so no one's\nmaking money off of it it's really just\na bunch of volunteers putting in the\ntime and resources to grow it so yeah\nhundreds of cloud comm if you want to\nlearn more cloud things as always you\ncan find me on Twitter at me by GPS and\nI will see you in the next video",
