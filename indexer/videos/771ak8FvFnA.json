  "title": "Are Cloud Agnostic Certifications worth it?",
  "transcript": "i personally don't think cloud agnostic\ncertifications or certifications from\ncloud platforms that aren't in the top\nthree so we're talking aws azure or gcp\nare worth it if this is like your first\ncloud certification\nmaybe you're already in cloud you\nalready know and then you want to i\nguess\nupskill with a you know cloud agnostic\nor a different kind of certification by\nall means but if you're a beginner and\nyou're looking where to invest your\nmoney and your time which you know even\nif we're talking about like a\nfundamental certification with one of\nthe big three it's around 99 usd that's\na good amount of money like you're going\nto want to put that towards your best\nbang for your buck the thing that helps\nstick out the most and get the most\nrecognition on your resume and without a\ndoubt that is going to be\nany aws azure or gcp certification\ncompared to like a cloud agnostic one\nalso when it comes to pricing a lot of\nthe big platform ones are around 160 to\nlike 200 for an associate level\ncertification whereas i think i saw the\ncloud plus somewhere around 350 usd\nwhich in my mind is a significant amount\nof money and if you're gonna put that\nsignificant amount of money in time\ntowards something it should be something\nthat gets you the most value out of it\nthe content of these cloud access\ncertifications is great like i'm not\nsaying that they're not worth it that\nthey're terrible certifications what not\nno definitely not i just think when\nyou're going to invest time and money\ninto something you want to do something\nthat gets you the most back for it right\nand don't think just because you study\nfor one certification that later on you\ncan't go and get another one in a\ndifferent cloud of course not like for\nexample me\ni studied i was working help desk study\nfor my aws certified developer associate\ntook me like six months\nif you want my notes it's on learn to\ncloud go to phase three you'll see a pdf\nwith all my notes it's like 60 pages\nand then i used the knowledge for that\nand for an interview at a place that\nused azure and then i got the job and\nthen you know the rest is history and a\nlot of these certifications\nfrom the big platforms will teach you a\nlot of fundamentals and a lot of just\ncloud knowledge in general that will\ntranslate into other providers so you\nknow like i mentioned i was able to\nleverage the stuff that i learned for\nthe adv certification into working with\nazure\nand it's still helped me throughout my\nentire career\nbut that first step to picking like that\nfirst certification definitely stick to\none of the big three\nagain it's all about getting the most\nout of your time and money and where the\nmarket currently is at\nyou can't go wrong with any of the big\nthree\nanyway super short video today i'm still\nfiguring out my setup i'm at a new\napartment i'll have a new tour soon and\nwhatnot but thank you for watching and i\nwill see you in the next one",
