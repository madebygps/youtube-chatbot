here\nFrederico\nwhat up Jammin what up yeah yeah yeah\nyeah yeahI've been playing guitar a lot more so I\ndon't know if people know this but\nbefore I got like really into\nuh like getting my life together and\nlearning Tech I was I used to like play\nplay guitar and I kind of grew up\nplaying guitar\num like work with audio and stuff like\nthat\nand when I started like learning you\nknow actually like working the help desk\ngig and then\nlearning Tech and stuff like that I like\nhad to push all my hobbies and just\nstuff that made me generally happy\num\naway\nbut I've had I have this guitar so let's\npoll 100 and then I have like a fender\ntell acoustic back at my parents house\nthat I never brought to New York with me\nbut\nlast week I was like why am I wasting so\nmuch time on like social media on\nTwitter and stuff like that where I\ncould like easily grab those hours I\nwaste a day and kind of just put them\nback into stuff that actually does me\nwell\nso this that's what I did this week like\nI grabbed all this time I was wasting on\nsocial media and kind of just started\nplaying more playing more video games\nplaying more guitar I'm learning a new\nsong stuff like that\num\nand man have I been significantly\nhappier like I don't know if y'all saw\nme stream like two I think it was like\ntwo weeks ago where I was like\nI was like I felt like I was just done\nwith tech in general but I think it was\njust a lack of uh\nnot do not doing things outside of it\nresearching on whether I want to switch\nback to it from GIS mapping got my\ndegree in GIS and moved to it went back\nto GIS now I want to get back into it\nwhy do you want to get back into it\nthat's my first question not saying\nthere's anything wrong with the decision\nI kind of just want to know why\nI'm a non-tech guy at 34 guide me\ntowards a cloud Tech Guy please learn to\ncloud.guide\nChristian uh saludoshello love your videos real\ninformational thank you I appreciate the\nappreciate you hanging outthe only thing about having this setup\nlike this is like this is like really\nfar from where I sit now so it's kind of\na painum let me seeI feel like I already answered that\nanyway\ndrink some coffeeah yes the docker dramauh dockerso did you all see that Docker is\nsunsetting the free team subscriptions\nthey I gotta find their uh their blog\nthough so we can look at this togetherblog and then they recently I don't know\nhold on let's do this switch to\nlet me move this overokay let me pop this out one second pop\nout the chat okay cool we can move this\noverand then we'll switch to\nokay we'll switch here we'll look at\nthis we'll look at this together my\nfriends okay cool\noh my goodness hold on I'm getting\nI'm not even signed in I need to\nturn remove this from here okay anyway\nso Docker drama we apologize we did a\nterrible job announcing the end of\ndocker free teams did anyone see thisanyone anyone see thisum where the heck did the chat go\noh wait I have too many things open\nlet me close this okay\nhold on y'all I'm still getting used to\nthis new platform that I'm using to\nstream\nso we'll see this hereuh\nuh\nhey GPS good morning or good afternoon\nuh it's 11 45 so it's about to be the\nafternoon here\nuh I'll catch up on the messages in a\nsecond but yeah did anyone see this did\nyou all see this did y'all see this um\nwe apologize we did a terrible job\nannouncing the end of docker-free teams\num\nfor those of you catching up we recently\nemailed accounts that our members of\nfree team organizations to let them know\nthat they will lose features unless they\nmoved to one of our supported free or\npaid offerings this impacted less than\ntwo percent of our users note that this\nchange does not affect DACA personal\nDocker Pro Docker team or Docker\nbusiness accounts Docker sponsored open\nsource member soccer verify Publishers\nor Docker official images\nthe docker free team subscription was\ndeprecated in part because it was poorly\ntargeted in particular it didn't serve\nthe open source audience as well as as\nwell as our recently updated Docker\nsponsor open source program the latter\noffering benefits that exceed those of\nthe deprecated free team plan obviously\nthey're going to say that I don't really\nknow I haven't looked into it but I saw\nthis I don't I can't remember how I\nfound out of this drama\nuh we also like to clarify the public\nimages will only be removed from Docker\nHub if their maintainer decides to\ndelete them so anyway\ninitially the way I saw this like people\ngetting mad because now they've got a\nswitch or they got to start paying for\nsome stuff\nuh how do you all feel\nso I do I do agree that potentially the\nway that they announce the the stuff was\nlike\nokay you're kind of like missing some\ncontext and like this follow-up\nlike does a great job of saying like oh\nwhy we're actually doing it and why it's\nlike a great fitbut also\nI feel like people like to get mad over\neverything and this is also another good\nreason why I'm happy I've like gotten\noff Twitterbecause people love to have just\ndiscussions on absolutely anything\nuh yeah so\nwell open source images I rely on get\ndeleted not by Docker oh I like thatI like how I like how this is their\nfirst line here not by Docker that's\nlike okay they learned from I guess\ntheir mistake of not communicating well\nthe first time\nwhat if I run an open source project I\nsaw someone share this like oh doctors\nbeing hostile\nuh because of this move that they made\nso anyway Docker continues to offer a\nspecific Docker sponsored open source\nprogram for open source projects and it\nis not affected by Sun setting by the\nsun setting of free team organizations\nfor new users\ninterested in owning adjoining dsos\nthat's a funny abbreviation from a\nprevious free team organization we will\ndefer any organization suspension\nRevolution while the DDOS\ndsos application is under review\nthis will give organizations at least 30\ndays before we suspend them if the\napplication is ultimately rejected\nreleasing\nyeah I don't know it seems like they\nhave a path forward so\npretty interesting\num yeah but what do people think how\nmany of y'all use see also like I might\nbe it's like I don't maybe there's not a\npoint to talk about it because it says\nless than two percent I feel like the\nmajority of y'all are probably using\nlike darker personal\nor\num or like you have an account with like\nthe company that you workforcing my like\nDocker Pro or something like that I feel\nlike in the open source space so this\nwas like making some news some headlinesum we should try to full face now\nwell I catch up on this chat what does\nit say here\nuhuh okay here\nmy last company overworked me before and\nduring the pandemic\nI was working 70 hours per week and I\nburnt out GIS wages are low and there\naren't too many jobs out there for that\nso you want to get back into Thai tea\nbut so okay so the question is now is\nlike why did you switch from it to GIS\nand then you switch back and then you\nswitch track again right like why did\nyou keep doing that because I feel like\nif you make the switch again if you're\nnot resolving the re the issue that you\nkeep switching and then you just do a\nswitch again then you're probably gonna\nend up switching again if you don't like\nresolve like the actual issue that's\nwhat I'm trying to trying to get atuh\ndid I miss the Twitter description oh\nTech Twitter Tech I don't know I I mean\nI always have always ranted about tech\nTwitter but I've never really done\nanything about it I've always been like\nokay this is I've accepted that this is\na part of my life and that I just have\nto be a part of it but I don't know what\nhappened I think it was like last\nSaturday I found myself like being\nmiserable actually I found myself being\nmiserable for the past couple of weeks\nand\num you may or may not know but I'm a\nvery likesnip snap snipsis that that's is that a reference to\nThe Office episode that's freaking\namazing anyway back to the tech Twitter\nthing so anyway I found myself sitting\ndown and being like miserable and like\nas you know me I'm someone who journals\nlike I've journaled every single day for\nthe past\nsix seven years or so\nso I kind of went back through like oh\nmy the past couple of entries for the\npast couple weeks and kind of like\nnoticing this trend of like\nI'm consistently comparing my career and\num just the progress I made and the\nstuff that I'm doing and kind of working\nin like the future for like next things\nthe next projects solely depending on\nlike\nTwitter like what will do well on\nTwitter like oh what will get the the\nTwitter crowd on my side or like that\nkind of stuff\nso I was looking at back at that and\nthen I kind of like sat down and I'm\nlike I'm so freaking stupid it's so dumb\nbecause if I look back like at my life\nonly five years ago\num\nI would have I would have dreamed no I\ndreamed and I prayed and I and I worked\ntoward having lives that I have now\nhaving the salary that I have now having\nthe credentials the resume the\nexperience the peers the the support\nfrom my family the the living situation\num an amazing partner like all these\nthings I just only could have dreamed of\nbefore and now that I have it it's like\nI'm to an extent find myself being more\nmiserable than I was back then right\num\nso then I was like okay I gotta make\nlike some kind of change so I\nessentially what I've done is like\ndecided to pretty much quit all social\nmedia except for\nsharing potentially any events or any\nlike resources or sometimes and I'll log\nin maybe like once every couple of days\nor something like that to see\num\nif there's I don't know anything worth\nlike in my mentions that are worth\ntaking a look atum\nand I I don't I don't want to log in at\nall but I had to log in like I think\nyesterday two days ago because I was is\nI was waiting for someone to message me\nback that's a hard thing too like having\ncommunication through social media is\nlike the worst\num\nbut I was waiting on someone to to\nmessage me back so finally they messaged\nme back like I think it was yesterday so\nthat was kind of opened up so I won't\nnecessarily have to take a look at\nanything but it should I guess it's\ngreat so it's like obvious like everyone\nknows like you know comparison is like\nthe absolute worst thing you can do\nbecause you can't really compare\nyourself to anyone because\nyou only live the life you only live the\nlife and you lose the life\nthat you have right\nlike if you go and compare yourself to\nsomeone else and their life becomes\nbetter whatever that's their life like\noh my goodness something's glitching\nright I feel like I see something\nglitching\nI could be wrong though\num I'm slightly paranoid when it comes\nto this video stuff because I want it to\nbe like pristine\num\nbut yeah\nthat's essentially why I'm I'm not like\ndeleting my profiles they're gonna be\nthere I'm just not going to use them and\nI don't think it like and I think that's\ngonna lead it to be lead my profiles to\nbecome essentially useless\num so I don't like it won't gain any\nfollowers and things like that which I\nthink in the context of advocacy should\nbe interesting but\nthe one thing I have to my favorite is\nabsolutely this YouTube channel so as\nyou know I've like still actively post\non here\nI did two videos this week I have a\ncouple of other videos coming out\num and I definitely want to use all that\ntime that I get back on that peace of\nmind and that mental ability that I\ngained from not worrying about social\nmedia to building like better content\nbetter labs for y'all better projects\nand that kind of stuff and just upskill\nengine like in my engineering skill setum\nso yeahthose are my thoughts thereif you are off Twitter where can you\nfind where can we find you other than\nYouTube that's it YouTube\nI don't want you to find me but you also\ndon't need to find me don't need you\ndon't need to keep up with me I'm not\ndoing anything important yeah like yeah\nlike use that time to I don't know spend\nwith your loved ones instead of worrying\nabout like what anyone else is doing\nactually\num if I have anything important to share\nthat I feel is not going to steal your\nattention that I feel is actually going\nto be useful for you all a career I'm\ngonna put it on my YouTube\num that's ithow to become so diligent like you to\nwrite a journal every single day so I\nhave\nman I have so many of these right now so\nthe third thing you need to do is grab\nlike any sort of notebook so I I use\nthese these are I don't know what\nthey're they're mole skins but they're\nlike the cheapest ones available\nand what I pretty much do is I get the\ncompletely blank ones because I wish not\nbecause I wish because\nI used to worry so much about like oh it\nneeds to be super fancy and my\npenmanship needs to the best and all\nthat kind of stuff but then I realized\njust having blank so essentially this is\njust blank pages right there's nothing\non here you see that nothing on there\nbut what you but I find like the\nabsolute like best format that works\nwith me is like the first two couple of\npages you see that it's just my table of\ncontents like that's the date and that's\nthe page that I wrote it on so then when\nI start a new\nwhen I start a new like entry like I see\nyou seven I mean I obviously don't want\nto show you all but like like that\nlike I have like longer ones I have one\nday I have days where I'm like\ncompletely\ncompletely just venting so much but the\ngoal is like you write the date on the\ntop you write whatever you have to do\nand then you put the page number on the\nbottom and then at the pages in the\nfront that's you put the date like oh I\nwrote about this day on this page and\nthen if you ever need to reference them\nyou just go back that you find the date\nand you go perfect\nah someone's a Docker you mean podmanum\nlet me seebut yeah so\num so making it a very simple super\nsimple system but also just the the\npower of momentum the power of of having\nlike a streak the power of like\num you're just doing something every\nsingle day at some point is more than is\ngoing to be enough to keep doing it uh I\nuse this app everyone knows this though\nI'm like accent I'm obnoxious about it\nbut I have this this habit tracking app\nright and it's to the point where it\nmight be silly but it works for me where\nit's like I can just check off the task\nlike I just journaled before going live\nso I can just hold this down\nand then like that is so satisfying\nand\nlike there's days where like I don't\nlike you see the X's there though so the\ndays that I missed for whatever reason\nlike last weekend I was at my parents\nhouse so I didn't have anything well I\nprobably could have but I didn't want to\num\nbut yeah as you can see it's like just\nhaving something to help you build\nmomentum I think is important for any\nkind of habit you want to do\num so yeah\nthose are kind of my my tips there I got\nyou I share the same\nfeelings when we reach a moment position\nin our life texture makes us feel like\nthe most people there are so much drama\nabout life seems affirmative yeah I feel\nlikeit was just helping me take for granted\nso much that I have like so like\nas cliche as as that as it sounds like\njust being alive and being able to do\nwhat I can do is what I should be\ngrateful for and what I should work\ntowards right\num I'm in a position for a reason and\nlike if if I weren't to do my absolute\nbest and if I were to like feel some\nkind of way out through because of\nthings that are outside of my control\nthat's essentially doing a disservice to\nto myself to my purpose to the people\nthat look up to me to the people that\nlove me that people support me so\nthere's no way to live y'all there's no\nway to live\nthe docker immune pod man is hilarious\nI know um\nD Minor T minor Bard chord on that\nguitar\nI'm terrible at bar chords like so the\nas you know with the guitar like\num you know I mean like you build like\nthe the the flexibility elasticity with\nlike your your your fingers individual\nFingers\num like the calluses all I lost all that\nlike I consistently played from like\nwhen I was like essentially 10 to like\n18 ish\nand then\num\nI stopped playing because I was like I\ngotta get I gotta figure out what to do\nwith my life how do I make money how to\nmake a career or whatever and then a you\nknow those Hobbies kind of went to the\nside\nand now like there's still some muscle\nmemory there but I'm like freaking Rusty\nlike bar chords you know obviously doing\nthe\nuh your index finger to create the bar\nit's like\nso difficult it's kind of frustrating\nbecause like I used to be I used to be\nable to do this so well and like but\nanyway we'll get there we'll get therethat's necessarily at all it's actually\nsuper Health useful yeah it's like\noh yeah and then all you gotta worry\nabout in the morning or not the morning\nbut the day is like just complete the\ntask that's it like you get it done and\nthen the next day okay you get it done\nand then the next thing you get it done\nand you kind of kind of keep building it\nlike that\nquitting in social media like Twitter\nfor me will always make me feel like I'm\nmissing out a lot yeah I used to think\nthat too but guess what then like it's\nonly been like um\na couple of days and I'm like I missed\nI've I've because of being part of\nTwitter I've been missing out so muchyeah\ndo you do you feel obligated to post on\nTwitter before yeah I kind of did I felt\nlike okay what's the next thing that I'm\ngonna do to get likes what's the next\nthing I'm gonna do to like get uh\nengagement what's the next thing I'm\ngonna do to go viral or whatever it is\nso\nif all that man F all that\ndo you get tired of the grind you got my\ndegree got certified I learned\ninfrastructure as code and Docker feels\nlike I'm selling these crouching surface\nespecially with tech influences raving\nabout everything and that's also why I\nstoppedI\nwe like the glorify Tech\num\nand like you'll see like these tick\ntocks or these short form content uh\nshort film videos they're all like\noh like look at all these perks that I\nget and then they don't really show the\nwork and so it's people will come in and\nbe like oh this is they get to live this\nlife so easy whatever but it's not\nrealistic\nand they they fake the grind like anyone\ncan do a day in the life video\nA Day in the Life video making it seem\nlike so perfect whatever but for one day\nand then the rest of the day they go\nback to what their actual life isbut I don't so I don't get tired I don't\nget tired of working like my actual job\nand like making videos like that that\npart I don't I can't I could work like\n12. I was I was just talking to my\ngirlfriend about this last night because\nI was telling her about like how I was\nfeeling\nand I told her like I don't get tired of\nthe work like that's not the part that\nthat is like the grind for me the graph\nI wanna Grant isn't even a bad thing\nlike the exhausting part is all the\nadditional stuff around it like right\nso that the actual social stuffs\nwell actually sitting down learning new\ncloud services learning learning\nanything or like even just building\nsomething to teach or whatever it is I\nlove that and I I could I could do that\nfor the rest of my life until I decide\nto retire\num but in order to make that sustainable\nlike\nyou gotta you gotta I gotta drop like\nsome other stuff right\nuh is there any days where you feel like\nnot working at all when you feel like\nyou're not doing anything sometimes I\nhave consecutive days where I cannot get\nthings done how to balance your bad yeah\nI've I've had been feeling so this is\nexactly what brought me to this decision\nit's like I hadn't been feeling that for\nthe past couple of months\num\nmaybe since like the mid-January late\nJanuary\nand I can and I thought that\num\nI thought that maybe it was time to make\na a change in career maybe I should go\nto another company maybe I need to move\nout of the city\num I was like\nI was like\nputting the blame or against the\nresponsibility on all of these external\nevents so somehow\none day when I sat down and I realized\nokay what really is in my control what\ncan I change to make myself feel like\nbetter\nI made some changes and now like the end\nof this week\nI'm like wow this is this this is life\nthe way I want to live\num but also accepting that some days\nyou can do well and then some days you\ncannot do well and then you always have\nthe opportunity to do well again the\nnext day\nbecause if you feel bad about doing bad\nthen the next day you're gonna you're\ngonna bring in that feeling of bad\nand you're gonna have another bad day\nand then that becomes like a vicious\ncircle so you're not allowing yourself\nto\nyou're not giving yourself another\nopportunity\nwhat you're setting yourself up for\nfailure kind of thing and this is me\ntalking to myself because\nwe're all sort of trying to figure out\nhow to deal with this in a healthy wayum\nyeah anyway\nit always seems like a catch uh\nout always seems like a catch-up gameI agree it's it seems like a catch-up\ngame if you're comparing yourself but if\nyou if you fully dedicate yourself to\nonly what you want to accomplish and you\ndon't look around like seek out seek out\nmentorship in terms of like look into\nlook up\nlook out no not so we're looking to\nor keep up to date I guess with people's\ncareers that you actually want\num but only use what they share as one\npart to formulate what you want to do\nand to formulate your opinion even\neverything I say like let it only be one\npart and then go hear what else someone\nelse has to say and then with that make\nyour decision\nbut once you dedicate yourself to kind\nof just like 100 what you have to do\nit doesn't seem like a catch-up game\nbecause what do you have to catch up to\nyou don't have to catch up if you're\ncomparing yourself to someone else but\nonce you see it like it's just you then\nit's more so like okay\nawesome I'm getting this done then the\nnext I'm gonna do this but it's you\nagainst you kind of thingif all that yeah somebody phrased like\nthis to me shiny internet numbers go up\nand when I view it like that it just\nseems silly yeah just internet numbers\nthat's literally all it is\num\nyeah I even got I even found myself\nhaving that issue with YouTube\nand I had been like okay I probably\nshould quit YouTube but then I was like\nno I feel like if I just stop caring\nabout metrics numbers I can still share\na lot of useful stuff on here so no I'm\nnot quitting\numwhat would you suggest if I want to\nstart learning cloud provided I have a\ndecent knowledge in web dev well you\nprobably have projects go deploy them to\ndifferent cloud services like deploy it\nin a serverless\num\ndeployment model then deployed in like a\nVM then deployed in a container and with\nthat you'll have plenty plenty of\nprojects to to get hands on with\nlooking to transition from help desk to\nCloud I've been coding python for about\na year got AWS systs off so a year ago\nbut I've never done it in a job what\nelse do I need I gotta go back over\neverything\nhelp desk the cloud okay so first of all\ntell me about how much experience you\never helped us tell me about the tasks\nyou accomplished there and then tell me\nabout the projects you're working on\nlike what kind of Hands-On skills you\ngot with Cloud I'm not talking about\nlike professional I'm just talking about\nany Hands-On skills like what projects\nhave you done also what I tend to tell\npeople is like from that support level\nto the cloud entry level like it's very\ndoable if you have like a year or two\nbut sometimes you might be able to make\nthe step to like assist admin to like a\nnetwork admin something like that where\nyou have you you still get to work on\nwith some stuff with Cloud but it's not\nlike a full Cloud job which I in my\nopinion is\nit's like it's like a ladder right you\ntake the next step and then the next\nstep and the next step and whatever\nsometimes you can I don't know if you're\nstrong enough you can\ngo up uh two steps on the ladder rightum\nbut yeah like a lot of these the\nsysadmin admin roles or like anything\nthat kind of gives you access to a lot\nof helpless like support roles too a lot\naccess to something like active\ndirectory at 365 like that's Cloud stuff\nlike you can take all that knowledge in\nthe Hanson's experience and leverage it\nfor your interviewing or for your\nprojects for your next position\num you just got to be open to it like a\nlot of jobs out there will give you\nexposure to Cloud without having cloud\nin the title so keep that in mind too\nI did nine Azure certifications last\nyear what why\nI'm mentally exhausted and yet it feels\nI have done nothing anything worth I\nwonder if it would lead anything or\neventually would matter you don't nine\ncertifications so you clearly have a\ndiscipline to study which is awesome\nwell I always tell people two\ncertifications is more than enough you\ngot to do certification project\ncertification project once you've got\ntwo solid projects you got your two\ncerts you got a year of some kind of\ntechnical experience I feel like you\nhave the whole pack and then you got a\ngood resume you got a good um LinkedIn\nyou got you have the whole package to go\nand kind of apply to that first Cloud\nrole or that first thing that will give\nyou exposure to Cloud after like your\nfirst support role right so\nyeah\nuhbut yeah like and again I feel like a\nlot of this like going following\ncertifications constantly passing\npassing passing sharing sharing is is is\na result of\na clout building or clout chasing on\nthings like LinkedIn on things like Tech\nTwitter\num\nbecause it's like oh like I passed this\neveryone's gonna congratulate me and it\nkind of gives you like a fake sense of\naccomplishment\num\nor like Instagram I wouldn't necessarily\nsay Instagram application but because it\ntakes you time to study of course but\nit's like okay once all that dies down\nwhat do you have at the end you have a\ncertification but like what did you\nreally learn what do you have to prove\nto your employers or like your potential\nemployers or your potential clients or\nwhatever right\nI passed Daisy 900 yesterday that's\nawesome kind of threw myself in the fire\noutside of looking for an entry-level\njob do I start starting for 104.\nso again like I mentioned that like kind\nof like that that\nlike what you're trying to build so if\nyou have no technical experience you're\ntrying to get into Cloud\num I highly recommend doing support for\nlike a year\ntwo certs two projects good LinkedIn\num profile\ngood resume practice interviewing skills\nand then go into like the cloud search\num\nthe 104 depends I think the 104 is a\ngood one the 104 the 204 in terms of\nlike the Azure sphere are good um next\nsteps after 900. and\nyou could potentially look at a Prof\nlike what do they call it specialty or\nprofessional after that if you wanted to\nuh but 104 204 I personally like I\nhaven't taken the 104 the 204 but I\npersonally think the 204 seems a lot\nmore fun than the 104 but I think the\n104 might be more applicable when it\ncomes to like Cloud admin Cloud support\nwhich I tend to be more entry level\nfriendly what is the easiest role in\nCloud the easiest role in cloud is the\none that you're most prepared for\nthe main issue that majority of it have\nit is they are missing the most\nimportant piece math to do anything\nAdvanced requires math and it's a\ndifferent way of thinkingit is different way of thinking to\nproblem solve those\ntwo are key\nanything Advanced requires math what\nkind of math are you talking about\nthoughlike are you talking like college\ncalculus what kind of math are you\ntalking about I'm moving to Germany in\nthe next two months do you have an idea\nwhat it is no no idea about Germany\nno\nno idea my friend apologies I want to\nsay apologies because you know I just\ndon't know anything about it also I\nhelped the server admin A.D nice those\nthat's gonna be great uh onboarding\noff-boarding DNS IP reservations setting\nup APS switch management VoIP Set uh all\nadmin lifted okay good good I think you\ncan take leverage that and go to network\nadmin sysadmin do a year and then you\ngot like\ngood experience then you move into like\nCloud admin Cloud networking something\nlike that can I land\nan entry-level role with a college\ndegree and not much work experience just\nan internship what about no experience\nas possible to land a car a job with a\njust a college degree to graduateI like to tell people that Landing a\nrole is only 50 in your control and that\n50 is relies on like can you prove your\nskill set you have a good resume do you\nhave like you know all the things that I\nmentioned and 50 is just luck it's just\nopportunity is the hiring manager in a\ngood mood are these people more open\nmore willing to take on new people that\ntype of that type of thing\numso so if that's like the the equation\nthen anyone can land a job with any kind\nof\num a combination of those things in\nreality because you have some people who\nlike just get offered\num\njobs like\nbecause they're like they happen to be\nat the right place at the right time\nthat's it\nmaybe they have like a family member who\nowns like some sort of company or\nsomething like that right\nso don't think about it as like okay\nwhat's the perfect formula to land a job\nit's more so okay what is in your\ncontrol\nthen go and\nget it done again I'm I still mention\nlike your best bet up for going into\nlike a lot of these entry-level Cloud\nroles it's like you're looking at people\nwho are transitioning from other spaces\nfrom tech people who might have um\ncareer like degrees in cloud or degrees\nand some sort of I.T related thing\num and if you got no experience you\nmight want to just consider like doing a\nmonth in a month a year and some kind of\nentry-level Tech role\nget your shirts up get your projects up\nget your resume done get your LinkedIn\ndone and then going applying right\nbecause like it's like think of it like\na video game like I'm playing okay so\nlet's do it this way\nI'm currently playing Zelda breath of\nthe wild okay I've beaten all the Divine\nI know I've freed all the Divine beasts\nand now I gotta go begin okay but\ncurrently I'm very underpowered I don't\nhave the master sword I only have 12\nHearts I need to get one more heart to\ngo get the master sword\num like I know I know the game pretty\nwell right\nbut now what I gotta do is I gotta go\nand and\num unlock some more shrines get some\nmore heart vessels\nand probably do some side quests like\nthat kind of stuff and then build it up\nso I have enough to go and beat the the\nthe boss like the final boss right it's\nthe same thing when you want to go and\napply for your role like you can go as\nmany times as you want but if you end up\ncontinuously finding yourself being\nrejected\nit's because you got to go and you gotta\nyou gotta unlock some more shrines you\nget it right so it's like it's like the\nsame thing right like it's it's like the\nsame the same\nthe same mentality is like you gotta\nlevel yourself up against your because\nthere's going to be a lot of people out\nthere trying to go for these jobs tooum\nhi suenza\nyo just call me GPS all right uh\nany virtual home lab environment racks I\nlooking into hybrid Cube currently for\nIMA projects you know what's awesome\nthis not virtual\num I know Day Day cyber walks in YouTube\nhas a good home lab type thing I know\num Kev Tech he has Kev Tech I.T support\nuh he has a good home lab type of thing\num\nI was gonna say like what is this Tech\nwith Tim I think is his name he does a\nlot of Home lab stuff it's like physical\nstuff you're asking for virtualum\nyeah I don't know too much I've I've\nalways just done stuff straight into\nlike kind of cloud\num but I guess I've had the privilege of\nhaving some money to spend so I don't\nhave a degree in CS but I want to move\ninto Tech so should I do masses from\nabroad or try to get a job in a company\nlocated outside of India I know India so\nokay so here's another thing\nalso like Twitter and social media will\ntell you like you don't need a degree to\nget into Tech that like they'll just\nmake those blank blank techno Tim yeah\nthat's it those blanket statements you\ndon't need to agree to get into Tech I'm\nhere to tell you that the answer really\nis it depends right so for context I\nused to live in Ecuador Ecuador's in\nSouth America Ecuador is a very like in\norder to be like a cashier at\num a grocery store you need to have a\ndegree like that's just it there's no\nlike you can't go on Tech Twitter and be\nlike this is BS like they don't care\nlike you need to go and get your degree\nand then you can potentially have your\nfirst entry level job right I know that\nis the case for a lot of com of\ncountries and I know India shares sort\nof that too where it's like everyone you\nhave to get a degree\nor like I mean obviously there's those\nfluke chances right\nbut you have to get a degree so that's a\nreality like you kind of have to figure\nout what you're working with where\nyou're at and what you're willing to put\nup with and then put yourself through\nthat\nI have the privilege of being a U.S\ncitizen and living in the US and being\nin this generation of professionals\nwhere it's like the the degree\nrequirement for tech jobs here is a lot\nless rigid as it used to be right\nso then for me it was like okay I guess\nI could just work my way up\nand figure it out there\nthat's it but also it's tough for me to\nbe like you don't need to agree because\nit's your life what if what if you\nreally want a degree because you want to\nmake your parents proud of something\nlike that right there's so much Nuance\nhere\nuhin India there's a bias in degrees Yeah\nand if that's a bias you have to work\nagainst then you're gonna have to do it\nthis I loved living in Ecuador but I\nknew like that there was just a lot\nworking against me was like okay what\nother opportunities I have and I could\nsince I was born in the US I could just\nmove back to the US so I didumlove the breath of the wild yeah oh my\ngoodness that game is so good I it's\njust\nI've missed playing video games for suredid the cloud resume challenge got\nLinkedIn setup awss certifiedarchitect certified associate architect\ncircuit certified\nsolution architect associate oh my\ngoodness what's a good entry job for\nsomeone with several years tier one\nthree uh it analyst for okay you're\nlooking at probably Cloud support\nnetwork admin Cloud admin\num pay attention more to the\ndescriptions than the real titles for\nthat next gig I think the one after that\nis the one where you're like okay it's\ntime to figure out the niche it's time\nto figure out the specialty whatever it\nis but anything really that has cloud in\nthe description is probably something\nthat you're going to be doing really\nwell with uh just make sure you have\nsome good scripting skills I would say\nsomething at least Powershell or Bash\nI just got associate degree associate\ndegree in cloud computing does that\ncarry much weight to any possible yes it\ndoes I feel like certs carry more weightyeah but if you already have an\nAssociated degree getting a cert is like\nnothing like it'll take you like a\ncouple weeks to get and then you have\nboth\nso I still haven't beat Ganon yeah I'm\nlike running around I'm trying to get a\nlot of hearty dirt Darian no durian so I\ncan build those plates that give you\nlike 21 Hearts so I got them collecting\nall those I'm running around trying to\nfind these ancient screws so and stuff\nlike that so I can upgrade my weapons\nand then I tried beating him so this is\nalso okay so here's another thing\nso I\ntried to interview at places\numlike I want to say like every year\nbut whenever I feel like it's time to\nkind of like test my skill set in terms\nof like oh finding a new job or\nsomething like that\nputting yourself through like just\napplying through like the interview\nprocess and\nkind of seeing where you're at kind of\nmeasuring yourself I think is good too\nbecause I think the the worst thing to\ndo earlier on your career just be like\noh I found this job that's it it's kind\nof like what I'm gonna do for the rest\nof my life\num if you're looking to like move up\nright\num if you that's kind of like what you\nwant to do then that's completely fine\nbut in terms of like someone who's\nlooking to work their way up then I\ncould see that being like uh\nlike something that keeps you back right\nso and I thought of this because\nyesterday I I was like maybe I should go\ntry to fight Ganon and kind of see\nhow much more do I need\nto to win so I got I got him down to\nlike 25 percentand\nI was like okay I'm I'm close I'm this\nclose I just need to I need to upskill a\nlittle bit more I need to build my\ndefenses a little bit more I need to get\nbetter you know tools and whatever\nbut like putting yourself through\ninterview process especially when\nespecially earlier on like I was\napplying to everything and even though I\nwas getting rejected\num\nlike it just just the the ability to\nkind of measure yourself like like okay\nI did well here I did bad here sometimes\npeople will provide you feedback\nsometimes they won't which sucks I wish\neveryone did\num but that's also like okay take any\nanything that you get rejected from also\nhas an opportunity to learnhold on I I've I keep losing\nnow I want to go play breath of the Wild\nuh I answered that one\nuh uh finding a difficult to grow in the\nUK lots of requirements for the smallest\nof increments Gonna Keep at it though\nthis that's the mindsetthe rejection is always hard the more\nyou do it\nthe better you get at accepting itbut it never gets easyum if you're someone who dates a lot\nlike I earlier in when I was younger\nit's not that I'm not young but when I\nwas younger uh I used to date like\nsignificantly and like we get rejected a\nlot\nand I was talking about this to I think\nit was like to my best friend the other\nday I was like I feel like just becoming\ncomfortable with the dating scene and\nthe rejection really does help helped me\nwhen I was going to get like\ninterviewing especially like\nthat transition from help desk to Sis\nadmin so I had so many rejections I had\npeople would call me I remember this\nlady called me back just to bash my\nresume like this how why would you do\nthis this looks terrible you're never\ngonna get a job this this is this this\nand I feel like if I hadn't been\nsomewhat comfortable with rejection that\nwould have just absolutely destroyed me\nand I would have been like I don't want\nto keep interviewing because I want to\nput myself through that again\nso yeah\nput you got to put yourself through itbreath of the wild was good the last\nboss gone into the pain because it plays\nlike a PowerPoint I'm justoh my goodness\ndoes Microsoft interview difficulty\nlevel depend on the year of experience I\ndon't know I've only interviewed here\nwell yeah I've only interviewed once so\nI don't really have an insight into a\nlot of people's interviews process I\nshould ask them that seems like um\nthis seems like a good good question to\nask some colleagues\nuh\noh there's 59 people watching thanks\ny'all we hit the we hit the I wanted to\nhit 50 people so let's try it let's go\nlet's try to go for 100. how about that\nlet's be bold and let's try to hit 100.\nAI seems daunting to learn suggestions\non where to start okay cool I have\nthoughts on this\nso back in the day I don't know how back\nin the day but let's just say early1990s no no late 1990s early 2000s\nAIML was strictly for the the the really\nwell\num\nacademics like academics the the people\nwho went to school and phds and Masters\nand doctors and all this stuff rightand then came a little bit more progress\nwhere okay other people could get\ninvolved with it and then like that\nevolution is to where it's now where the\nway you interact with AI and ml is\nthrough apis like you see stuff like\nopen AI Pi the stuff that Google's doing\nall that kind of stuff right\nso us as people who haven't dedicated\ntheir life to understanding Ai and ml or\nhow to develop these models and stuff\nlike that are now in positions where we\ncan go and sign up for open AI API\nthere's I think there's like an 18 Grant\nor 16 Grant now\nuh for a couple of months so people go\nget on that and you can learn how to\nleverage that already existing\ntechnology that has been abstracted for\nus for the masses and you can go learn\nhow you can go read I shared this in the\nvideo that I dropped yesterday it's like\nyou can go and read the research on how\nthese models work you can go and\nunderstand all the documentation you can\ngo pick the library of the language that\nyou are most comfortable with I did like\nthree different three not different\nprojects but three projects using open\nAPI\nand we're now it's sort of like that\ngoes and enables you to kind of get your\nhands\nwet and like I guess more productive\nwith that type of Technology then if\nyou're like\num then like I think I did this in this\nvideo before that like Association the\nassociation pattern like if from there\nyou're like okay I I'm really really\ninterested in this I want to dive deeper\nokay then take the next step into the\ntechnology be like okay how do I learn\nthis more how do I actually fine tune\nthese models\num how do I actually like you know all\nthat kind of stuff and then if you go\ninto that and you're like okay I want to\nlearn more then it's like okay how do\nyou develop your own model from scratch\nthere's so much potential but starting\nfrom like the highest level of\nabstraction which all this this\ntechnology is at now that's where you\nstart and that might be more than enough\nto make you\num to get a job that's extremely\nlucrative to make you to make your\nskills get much more Niche which makes\nyou you know more hirable I guess not\nmore hireable but more desirable in\nterms of your skill set\nso yeah\nlots of\nlots of potential there go go become\ncomfortable with stuff like co-pilot uh\nchat gbt uh not cheap gbt gpt4\num rgbt yeah gpt4\num that's like your first step rightuh and there's also like the\ncertifications out there like I think\nthe AI 200 is an interesting one that it\nwas just it was recently updated in\nFebruary\num I don't know the I know the other\ncompanies probably have some too\nso a lot lots and lots of potential\nthere\nGPS how do you manage Microsoft job in\nyour personal blog YouTube and live what\nis a match of organization\nso I like I like the I like the\nhow do I say this\numthe\ncohesion\nso I like to feel like I'm working\ntowards a a single goal or a single\npurpose or whatever word you want to use\nto define it right\nand I'm lucky to be now in a position\nwhere my stuff that I do for the company\nthat I work for and the stuff that I do\noutside they have a lot to do with each\nother\nmy goal at work is to build a nurture\nCommunity around Microsoft Technologies\nokay my goal on YouTube is to help\npeople land jobs in Cloud a lot of times\nthe stuff that I do in one I can\nabstract parts of it and then it comes\nback into YouTube so I'm not doing two\nthings like I'm not doing twice work\nlike maybe it's just like a 0.5 more\nwhatever something like that right\nso if I go and build a workshop or a\ndemo or something like that I can grab a\npart of that put it on YouTube and it\nhelps everyone too so that way you know\nit's like I'm being more efficient with\nmy time but also I feel like that also\npush pushes my career further uh in a\nway where it's like okay I'm doing\nsomething at work then I find so I grab\nit and then I tune it to the stuff that\nI do outside and then that and then from\nthere it Sparks something else that I\nwant to do from work and like it's it's\na it's a very lovely system that I've\ngot going onum\nso yeah that's kind of like the the I\nwant to methodology Maybe\nbut I also used a very simple system to\norganize my time I have like one app\nlike to do app and it's like the most\nbasic to do app out there it's like it's\nMicrosoft to do where it's like you have\na list but I barely use the lists I just\nhave one like okay these are things I\nneed to do and then I go on to my\ncalendar the beginning of the day I have\nI have a\num let me show you\nyou see that on the bottom I guess that\nwould be your bottom left schedule day I\ngo in the beginning of the day I\nschedule my day I'm like at this time\nI'm going to do this I look at my\nmeetings and stuff like that and then I\nwhenever it whatever the time says that\nthat's what I gotta do I do when I do it\nthat's it so for today I'm streaming\nuntil one and then I gotta go back to\nwork from one to five and then I have\nmore time in the afternoon or after that\nuh that I could potentially\nbe used to continue doing YouTube stuff\nor\nfree time\nall rightwhat's the next steps for you after\nCloud architect what is the most remote\njob within cloud and finally can you\ntell me is\nsome is jobs and how they differ from\nI.T jobs what is isso\nafter Cloud architect what do you mean\nafter Cloud Arctic okay so the I guess\nthe Muslim the the most like resident\nthe the part that resonates the most for\nme from this question is\nthe remote remote is not an aspect of\nthe field that you are in or yeah like\nwhatever career you choose remote is\nmore so something that is put in place\nCompany by company you can have two\ncompanies that do the exact same thing\none could be fully remote and the other\none could be fully in person okay so it\nhas nothing to do with the skill set\nthat you have also within that company\none can be fully remote one can be fully\nin person and one of them might be open\nto making more exceptions than the other\none the exceptions like okay you can\nhave remote three days you can be higher\nwhatever that depends on I guess the\nculture or whatever they have in place\nat your company or the place that you\nknow is in putting into place these\npractices\num\nso I would say\nyes Tech in general is more robot\nfriendly than other roles but don't\nthink that every single role in Tech\nwill be remote just because it is like\njust because all like all I can do cloud\nfrom my house why would I ever go on\nsite it's like well if there's a job\nthat's paying you and it's like the only\nopportunity you have and it's on site\nyou're probably gonna take it right so\nkeep that in mind rightI'm tracking rejections I'm at 35 road\nto 100. and I'm only counting actual\ninterviews not the auto rejects man\nthose ah\nI one of the most heartbreaking\ninterview experiences I had as a company\nI really really wanted to work for\nand it was this was I was still my cloud\nengineer gig so this was before leaving\nto join a cloud Guru\num\nno no no no no no hold on this was I was\nat my sis admin job before my promotion\nto Cloud engineer\nand I remember I got the the whole\ninterview process was a mess it was like\ntwo months I got to the very end\nand for some reason it was just taking\nforever for them to either reject me or\nto give me an offer and then I pulled\nout at the very very like last\nminute because then I ended up getting a\npromotion which was awesome\nbut there's nothing I mean in terms of\nlike that whole interview process or\nthat world of interviewing there's\nnothing harder than really wanting\nsomething really envisioning yourself in\nthe elk I got this job in the bag so\nthis is why I give the advice to like\ndon't ever Envision yourself in a job\nunless you actually have an offer\nI don't know why this comment made me\nthink of that but yeah\nwe got this we do got this what up\nMichael Scott nice wall Banner pick the\noffice has saved me\nfrom many many manyit essentially got me out of like a very\ndepressive state that I was in years ago\nso that's why I kind of keep it present\nlike I see it every day I have this\nother like uh fan art thing over there\nthat has this is like a collage there's\nlike a bunch of different office scenes\nin one one artwork it's freaking cool I\nlove it but having these small reminders\nthat oh there's many things to just\nsimply enjoy in life\nI think it's a good idea\ndoes terraform fall under any actual\ncert it's Cloud agnostic yes correctuh everyone going to be jumping on AI\nseems like a wasted opportunity to not\nscale up your skills in AI\nthanks for the answers I'm always\nstruggling with the right roadmap to\nkeep in Focus so like again in the video\nI showed yesterday you have the people\nwho are like AI will never do anything\nno need to pay attention and you have\nany other The Other Extreme AI is going\nto\num\ncompletely replace everyone there's no\nhope for everyone like we're all going\nto be obsolete et cetera et cetera et\ncetera and then you have all the space\nin between right so I feel like the\npeople over here who are like hey guys\nnever gonna do anything are definitely\nin trouble but the people over here who\nare like oh there's no hope for everyone\nare also going to be in trouble because\nultimately you end up missing the real\nopportunity the real media opportunity\nright so the analogy that I like to use\nhere is like it didn't go from horses\nfor transportation to self-driving cars\nand went from horses\nto Cars and Cars have had many many\niterations right\nto now just now self-driving cars rightum just barely becoming a technology\nthat is being acceptable and at the\nstate where it can be used right so I\nfeel like if you're on either extreme\nyou're missing that immediate\nopportunity I was like well what is the\nactual car what is the car opportunity\nhere right\nyesterday there was a presentation the\nMicrosoft did with uh introducing\nessentially this type of technology in\nthe entire 365 Suite I highly recommend\nyou check it out\nreally really cool and you can\nimmediately see how much more productive\npeople are going to become because of\nthis type of stuff\nbut if you are closed off to it\nthen that's the only way are you if\nyou're closed off to it or you're scared\nof it that's the only way to guarantee\nthat you're gonna be in trouble\nbut if you go open-minded and you're\nlike okay I can go learn this stuff\nlet me see how I can leverage it you're\ngonna be goodif not we all just you know we'll move\nout to Farms we'll raise our own cattle\nlike we'll be all right we'll figure\nsomething out text overrateduh\nthe YouTube channel is cloud agnosticcan you share your experience of working\nat Ms and also share how you and your\ncolleagues dealt with layoffs okayI'll preface this by saying I really\nlike working on Microsoft uh it's been\nmy dream company I have my dream role\nbut I would be doing myself a disservice\nby not being completely honest\num\nI I'm also someone who's I've shared\nthis publicly like my mentality for work\nis I've never considered work to be my\nfamily I know at the end of the day it's\nbusiness but it's business both sides\nlike it has to be beneficial for me in\nterms of like are you paying me what I'm\nworth am I being challenged in our\nbusiness from for the company side where\nit's like are you getting what you\nexpect out of like in in someone who\nworks like an employee rightlayoffs are difficult\num\nfor many many aspects I think like the\nmost obvious one is is just like\nobviously people are gonna lose people\nhave lost and are gonna lose and I\ninclude myself in that because I'm not\njust because like I have a presence\nonline or something like that doesn't\nmake me immune from anything really like\nI feel like I'm gonna get laid off every\nsingle day but to be fair I feel like\nthat even if the economy is in the\nabsolute best position right\nso obviously the first part is like\nlayoffs are difficult because these\npeople livelihood including myself\nso anyway\nthat's why I've always stressed the part\nof like being financially responsible\nand financially educated like I I have a\nvideo I did this a couple of weeks ago\non the resources that I used to really\njust understand money how to become\nbetter\num like how much do I really need to\nsave uh understanding 401ks\nunderstanding Roth IRAs understanding\ninvesting understanding okay how much\nmoney do I need available for myself in\nthat for the next three months for the\nnext five years is stuff that I don't\nneed available the next five years what\ndo I do with it stuff like that right\nthat is very important and that has\nenabled me to be like okay even though\nif I if I do get laid off I'm gonna be\nokay because I like put in the work to\nfigure this out but Financial education\nis is so lacking from\nSchool in generalum\nso there's the financial aspect of it\nthat's really difficult\num but also the the part where we have\neven less resources than\nthe the financial aspect is like the\nemotional aspect the toll that it takes\non someone to be laid off and also to\npeople who have\nlike people that they work with to be\nlaid off just one day like one day like\nthe next day this person is just not\nthere I think that's crazy because we do\nspend a significa this significant\namount of time working\num\nso it's tough for me there's been\ndefinitely moments of like a lot of\nanxiety a lot of sadness\num\nand you know I wish no one ever had to\nget laid off but that would be not\nrealistic in doing myself a disservice\nbecause that if I had that mentality\nthen I wouldn't go and prepare myself in\nas many ways as I could\nso yeah I mean that's kind of my\nresponse I'm not blaming anyone for\nmaking the moves that they they make I'm\nsure they have really smart people\nbehind those types of decisions\nbut\nyeah it sucks that's kind of like the\nonly feelings I have about it\nuh what up everyone\nsaying hi what app is that anyone what\napp are you talking about the The\nHabit tracker I use is called streaks\nI didn't know you lived at Venezuela and\nmoved to us no I'm I'm Ecuadorian okay\nI'm born and raised in the U.S and then\nwhen I was 10 my my parents\nmoved my brother and I my brother's a\nyear older than me to Ecuador and we\nlived in Ecuador for 10 to 11 years and\nthen I moved back so I was born here\noriginally\num but I speak fluent Spanish espanolis\nso I don't know but I've always had this\nlike\nnever really feeling like I feel half\nhere half an Ecuador kind of thing is\nit's an interesting feeling\num\nbut yeah\nuh hello have you ever found yourself\nstarting to study for a specific topic\nand then find yourself going down a\nrabbit hole of researching other topics\nyeah yeah yeah yeah yeah\nso naturally I think sticking to citric\nwait no no hold on I'm working as an\nadmin supporting Citrix environments so\nnaturally I think sticking with Citrix\nto be honest but I feel like security\nwas more enjoyable okay so here's my and\nI shared this I've done so many videos\nabout different things that I feel like\nwould be great advice for people in\ngeneral But ultimately things that I've\ndone for myself\nso I have this system of sort of\naligning or just finding things that I\nwant to learn and the only thing you\nhave to really do is say okay for the\nnext two weeks this is just what I'm\ndoing for the next three months is what\nI'm doing like figure out that time\nframe so for me it tends to be every\nmonth\nJanuary February into March it was\nheavily bashed it was heavily Linux open\nsource type of soft and towards like the\nmiddle when they like open AI stuff\nreally became like news thing I felt\nreally lacking like oh I need to hop on\nthis but I always I always sort of like\ntrust the systems that I've put into\nplace it's like no I know that I need to\nsee this through and then once it's done\nI can reevaluate so now March is\nessentially like I've got everything\nplanned out so going into April is my\nnext position like okay what am I doing\num how do I learn like how do I bring\nsomething new learn how do I work on\nsomething new whatever it is but you you\nkind of have to set yourself up with a\ngoal or but you're like okay I'm gonna\ndo this until then and just stick with\nit just see it through because if you\ndon't you constantly switch then you're\nnever going to get anywhere\nso keep that in mind\nin terms of like figuring out what you\nactually want to learn it is a balance\nbetween becoming better at your current\njob and then upskilling for what you\nwant to do later on\num\nand you kind of just have to find a\nbalance there like no one will be able\nto figure what that business decision is\nthan yourself because you are the one\nwho is going to have to live with the\nsalary that you make live with the work\nthat you got to do day to day uh live\nwith like putting yourself through\ninterviews right\num I have found that usually around like\nfor myself like a year year and a half\ninto a role I'm just consistently doing\nthe role consistently upskilling for the\nrole and then that's typically around\nthe time where I'll evaluate okay do I\nneed to learn something else to go to\nthe next role or do I want to double\ndown on what I'm doing now that's just\nwhat works for me but for you would be\ndifferent\nI'm in my second year in uni I'm\nstudying networking and information\nsecurity I'm really interested in cloud\ncomputing what can I do to get into it\nand does my major prepare me for itum\nso cloud computing is is you have\nnetworking you have\num\ncommand line experience so bash a\nprogramming language a cloud platform\nand some devops fundamentals so grab\nthat and kind of figure out what you're\nlacking and then in terms of the skill\nset once you fill those like feel what\nyou're lacking you have everything you\nneed in terms of does your major prepare\nyou for it I don't know I don't know\nwhat your curriculum looks like uh but\nthat's kind of what you need to know\nthat's like the pillars the foundation\nto to learn cloud computing\nuh hello GPS I'm Kenya and I watch the\nvideos a lot your inspiration thank you\nI hope you have a fantastic dayI think skill trades are insulated from\nlayoffs you can always make money with a\ntrade oh my goodness\napprentices don't make much but it'll\npay a few bills so this is literally I\ndon't know I feel like this chat has\nbeen just amazing because you keep\nbringing up stuff that I've been just so\nlike thinking about lately\nso my girlfriend has a business in HVAC\nso she runs a business she gets like\ncontracts she has you know that kind of\nstuff right\ndoes HVAC stuff right\nand we were literally talking yesterday\nbecause I've been interested in in\ninvesting in helping grow the business\nbecause I just see like and my dad does\nHVAC too and he's done HVAC for like 30\nyears so I have like a lot of insight\ninto what it looks like to work in that\nspace\nand the one thing that I have seen that\nhas just been consistent through my\nentire time of like my dad working there\nis that there is always jobs available\nand he says now like they can't they\ncan't\nthey can't find people to work and like\nthese these trades you make significant\namount of money like I think he's easily\nmaking 70 80 an hour and if you went\nindependent he could make significantly\nmore but he like needs benefits and\nwhatever stuff like thatand\nI think if you're someone who doesn't\nreally know what you're interested in\ngoing into a trade talk about job\nsecurity\nlike look at us all in Tech like yeah we\nwere uh like a couple years ago we were\nlike oh this is the best look at how\nmuch money we're making but now\nultimately our our destiny is up to the\ncompanies that we work for right\num\nbut a trade at the end of the day\neveryone needs an electrician everyone\nneeds a a plumber everyone needs a\num someone to do their HVAC all these\ntype of things\nso if you have any interest in that type\nof stuff I would say go for it\n100 go for it do it or even just do it\non the side like if you get weekend gigs\nyou racking up money thoughdo you go back to visit often I used to\ngo like every year and then pandemic\nobviously I want to go back in May\nthey're doing like um\nconference that I really wanted to do a\ntalk at so we'll see what happens\ngotta start being productive now as\nalways thank you for you guys GPS your\ncontent here is better in a lot of\npeople's lives so big thank you have a\ngreat day so Lopez\num\nappreciate you hanging out have a great\nhave a great one get get all the work\ndone I'm gonna hang out for like 10 more\nminutes because I gotta again I told\ny'all I do schedule stuff so at one\no'clock I gotta go back to to billing\nout something at work so yeahthank you\n[Laughter]\nyou mentioned Financial knowledge\nlacking a school system where do you\nthink would be a good place to start\nlearning about financing the global\nscene\nuh USA and Europe so first of all get\nyour your knowledge about your own\nFinancial system in place like as in\nlike you're you're not just like not\nwhere you're like you're based but your\nown money as you start to learn how your\nown money works you start to realize how\nlike at a global scale this could\npotentially work\num because maybe investing looks\ndifferent in the US and like in Europe\nand like in a bunch of different places\nbut the concepts of investing\nare pretty Universalso once you can sort of learn to do that\nand like I'm not telling you to go put a\nthousand dollars in the stock market\nlike you can just read on like four in\nthe US 401K is real high array stuff\nlike that\num and then you'll learn essentially\nlike the fundamentals of what investing\nactually is uh I'm not telling you to go\nday trade or anything like that right so\nonce you have your own Financial system\nlike you're good\nlike you know what your money is you've\ngot some sort of automation or whatever\nwhatever your system works like\nthen from that you're going to have like\nagain it's Association pattern with that\nit's like okay I have sort of like this\nMinds this these I've learned these\nthings about like this how does this\nwork anywhere else\nand then I'm sure you can you can find\nbooks and stuff like that that will\nteach you\nmore about that in other places\nbut the first step is like starting with\nwhat you can you can immediately you can\nimmediately work with I think\num do you think you'll ever do a cloud\nresume challenge over on your own\nplatform what do you meanwhat is that what does that mean\njust finished CCNA looking forward\neither at az104 AI 900 for my next\ntopics I understand they're different\nbut curious which one would have better\nreturn on investmentuh you got 104 what's your goal\nI mean to be honest the AI 900 if you\nhave some kind of cloud experience you\nif you have some kind of azure\nexperience you could probably knock that\nout in like two weeks so in the grand\nscheme of things if it just takes you\ntwo weeks to like get it done and\nupscale and that type of stuff it's also\nlike from what I've seen it looks like a\npretty fun and easy one to get Hands-On\nwith so you spend the news two the next\ntwo to three weeks learning a lot you're\nnot really like losing a lot of time\num\nand then you jumped into like a 104 204\nafter that\nthat's very doableexplain wealth stuff thanks\nthank youyou were back and helped us days if you\nwere back in your help desk days would\nyou worry about your technical skill\nbeing outsourced I am in delivery\nConsulting and feel that they want us to\nbe native speaking PMs and not technical\nwhat\ndo you do you worry about being\nyour technical skill being outsourcedI think this could apply to probably all\nroles being outsourced obviously the\nhigher your seniority the harder it\nprobably is to Outsource Your Role but\nthat's also why you kind of have to have\nlike an upskill system like I mentioned\nI have a video on this it was like my\nfirst video this year where it was like\nhabits for a successful career in Tech\nsomething like that\nwhere I talk about plan out your\nupskilling for a couple months or like\nwhatever the time frame works for you\nand then\nthat's I guess that's the one thing\nabout tech is like something like the\nthe work like balance is essentially\nTerrible by default\nbecause you're constantly at the risk of\nbeing replaced by either someone else\nwho can do it cheaper or someone else\nwho can do more for the same amount of\nmoney or AI\nso\nI agree with the the sentiment of\nworrying but just know you're not alone\nin worrying and if that brings you any\nconsolation then you know hopefully it\ndoes AI 900 is great nice and\ncomprehensive I want I want to take\nI want to take it and I want to do a\nstudy group with y'all what do you thinkI've been talking too much okay\nlast few questions get it in because I\ngotta\nI gotta bouncebut this this stream was nice it was\nnice to hang out with y'allum\nmy bad I was asking if you would do\nthe cloud resume channel on your Channel\nversus ACG\nthe thing about the cloud resume\nchallenge video is it's so long there's\na lot to do and I felt like that video\neven though it's maybe a little outdated\nit has like the majority of what you\nneed to do\nand\num it would take me a significant amount\nof time to do it for for myself uh and I\ndon't really have a lot of current\nthings I'm prioritizing that align well\nwith a video like that\num if at any point I do then I would do\nit but just now it's just not really\nsomething that I can put time intostudy would be great that would be great\nif I've done the 204s that were doing\nany of the fundamentals I don't think so\nmaybe the ones that you have no\nexperience with like so I don't think\nthe AZ 900 would be worth it but maybe\nsomething like the AI 900 the sc100 900\nthe the dp900 like any of the other like\nniches that you're not knowledgeable\nwith I think it might be worth it but\ndoing like 204 and then going back to do\nthe easy probably not the AZ 900. thank\nyou for your help really helps me a lot\nthank you for the five dollars I'm gonna\ngo buy a coffee with that later on or\nmaybe\nmaybe like a bacon egg or cheese or\nsomething or\nmaybe something else or maybe like a\nmaybe like a fruit juice I've been\nreally into like green juice lately\nall right let's see\nhello GPS if an employee has some years\nexperience in some Fields say data\nengineering and wanted to switch to\nanother field say cloud engineering\ndevops will the experience years get\nconsidered yes but it is up to you\nto put it in your resume and to shape it\nto be relevant to your next role\nokay so keep that in mind again every\ntime you go and you you submit your\nresume somewhere you gotta tailor it\nso don't just put like blanket send your\nresume out to every single role the same\nway as it is\nit's up to you to grab the experience\nthat you have and height how can I how\ncan I use this for my next role not only\njust for your resume because also when\nyou're in the actual interview process\nand\nyou know people are asking you questions\nand they'd be like why is this like um\nwhy like why should we hire you why is\nyour experience relevant it's up to you\nto put in the work to figure out why\nit's relevant\nall right all right y'all that is it\num I see people are interested in the\nstudy group I'm gonna keep that in mind\nI do have the opportunity to do\nsomething like this\npart of like being part of Microsoft so\num\nI care about you all wanting to upskill\nso all I want to see how I can help you\nwith that\num so yeah[Laughter]\nall right peace out everyone I will see\nyou I don't know when should when should\nI do the next stream before I leave\nforeign\nI constantly fight with myself as to how\noften I should do these streams I don't\nwant to do it every day because I feel\nlike that would be too much for y'all\nand too much for me but I know having\nsome sort of consistency is cool because\nyou all know you can tune in oh every\nFriday or every kind of day and if you\nhave any questions you can ask or if I\nhave anything to share I can do it\noutside of a video\nbecause I do like the live stream format\nespecially like these\num\nthese types\nof streams where I can just talk about\nanything\ntechnical streams are like\nbut these kind of streams are like a lot\nof fun\nwhat does Microsoft give Christmas gifts\nTech Hardware no\nI don't think I got a Christmas gift\nuh\nwhat up day\nFriday Fridaynights are tough because I'm trying to\nbe more social and going out like I'm\ngoing go-karting today it's gonna be fun\num once a week once I think once a week\nmight be the key might be the key once a\nweek but like Monday through Friday\nwhich says the best I used to do on\nThursday nights those things were lit\nhowever this one was pretty good too\num\nThursday night might be a good one too I\nmight try try I might try it next week\nThursday night\nnot too little not too much gfx all\nright we'll see maybe I'll do a poll or\nsomething like that all right thank you\nall so much for hanging out I see y'all\nnext week sometime hit the notification\nBell\nuh peace out",
