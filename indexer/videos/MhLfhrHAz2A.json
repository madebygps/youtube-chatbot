  "title": "How to become a Cloud Solution Architect | AWS, Azure, GCP 2022",
  "transcript": "cloud architects are the people that are\nin charge of translating business needs\ninto\ncloud solution blueprints while\nimplementing best practices when it\ncomes to cloud computing and also\nrespecting the needs and requirements\nand limitations that customers have and\non top of that offering recommendations\nthat customers might not even think\nabout right\nso this is why\nwhenever someone asks me hey gwen i'm a\ncomplete beginner to cloud and i'm\nlooking to land a cloud architect role i\ntend to tell them that architect roles\ntypically require years of experience\nand aren't really beginner friendly i'm\nnot here to discourage you if you feel\nlike you meet the requirements by all\nmeans go ahead and apply\ni just feel like beginners get confused\nbecause of two reasons one cloud rolls\nare\nextremely vague and not very well\ndefined and and two i think one of the\nmost popular certifications out there\nfor cloud beginners is the aws solution\narchitect associate and once they pass\nthe the certification they think like oh\ni have to go get a role that has that\narchitect name in it right um but anyway\nin this video i'm gonna explain what\narchitect does and some resources that\nyou can use to improve your architecting\nskills\nwith all that being said hi i'm gps and\nwelcome to a new video all right so in\nthe intro i gave you a definition of\nwhat a cloud architect is uh so let me\ngive you an example now so let's pretend\nthat i am the cloud architect on my team\nmy manager comes along and she tells me\nhey gwen we've been told that there are\ntwo team members on a different team\nthat currently spend about two to three\nhours downloading some files that are\ngenerated from a product that we own and\nthen submitting those files to an\nexternal website\nand we've been tasked with automating\nthis can you please come up with a\nsolution on how to implement this right\nso right right now what i want you to do\nis pause this video and kind of think\nabout what would be your next step right\nand while you're at it make sure to like\nand subscribe and share this video with\nsomeone who is interested in cloud\ncomputing okay\nso anyway let's get back on track here\num\nif your first thought is like oh i could\nprobably code something i could probably\ncontainers cicd pipelines all these\nkinds of things and you know slow your\nrole right because let's think about\nwhat we know here we know that files are\ngenerated from a product that we have so\nwe know where the files come from and\nthen we have two team members that are\ngrabbing those files in manually uh\nsubmitting them to an external website\nright so we know where the files come\nfrom so we know point a and then we know\npoint b where they need to end but we\ndon't know anything about the middle\nground there right and that's our task\nas a cloud architect is to have these\nconversations ask the right questions\nand to pair project requirements with\ncloud services that are out there right\nso for example\ncloud there are i think 10 container\nservices that you can use to deploy\ncontainers on azure and that's just\nazure alone how do you know which one is\nthe right one for your solution\nhalf of that is understanding all the\nthe possible services that are out there\nand you know understanding the pros and\ncons use cases and all those kinds of\nthings and part of those and the other\nhalf is understanding the requirements\nof your project right so for example\nlet's say we've decided that what we're\ngoing to end up doing is having the\nproduct that we own that generates the\nfiles\nsave those files to a blob container\nthat has a hot access tier right then\nwe're going to have two azure functions\none azure function is going to process\nfile submitted to the external website\nand then the second azure function is\ngoing to grab the processed file and\nmove it to a blob container that has an\narchive accessed here because we want to\nsave money of course now\nwe've figured that out but what we need\nto now figure out is what is going to be\nin the middle of those two functions\nthat are going to allow them to\ncommunicate\ntypically this is implemented with a\nmessaging service and when it comes to\nmessaging services one of the first\nquestions we should ask is are we\nworking with messages or are we working\nwith events and this isn't something\nspecific to azure this is specific to or\ngeneral for all messaging services out\nthere right so messages typically\ncontain some kind of raw data and these\nthis raw data is either going to be\nstored or is used to tell the\napplication that's going to consume the\nmessage how to consume it or what to do\nwith it right and then events are more\nlike lightweight messages and they're\nusually just used to like signal that\nsomething's happened the state has\nchanged the status has changed and they\ndon't really care about how they're\nconsumed right so in this case when we\nthink about our function our first one\nis going to tell our second one hey this\nfile is ready to be moved to archive\nthis is the name so we're going to stick\nwith messages here now through our sort\nof triaging and having conversations and\nfiguring out what exactly needs to be\nautomated we've also learned that we\ndon't care about the order of these\nfiles\nwe just care about them being processed\nat some point right then being moved to\nstorage archive once they've been\nprocessed at one point at some point\nright this is important because\nservices messaging services that have\nthese ordered guaranteed features first\nin for style fifo fifo tend to be more\nexpensive\nso in our case something like azure\nservice bus which uh guarantees order is\nprobably or overkill for a solution so\nwe can save some money if we use\nsomething like azure storage queues\nwhich guarantees delivery delivery at\nleast once well messing up my words\nthere anyway so this is the kind of\nmindset and the kind of questions that\nyou have to learn to ask half of that is\nyou know understanding the services and\nhalf of that is understanding the\nrequirements and these are things that\nyou just kind of pick up along the way\nusing different projects using different\nservices and things like that right but\nthen you have to multiply that across\nnot just you know which messaging\nservice which compute service uh which\nstorage service which networking service\nall these kinds of things right if your\ncustomer wants a traditional model and\nyou figure out that using a service\nmodel not only meets the requirements\nbut saves them money you should be also\nable to\nadvise that recommendation so this is\nwhy\ncloud architect roles tend to require\nyears of experience now again following\nup with what i mentioned that cloud\nrules aren't really defined\na cloud architect at a large company\nmight be really just tasked with\narchitect tasks while a cloud developer\nat a small team might be doing the\narchitecting a cloud architect that a\nsmall team might be also doing the\ndevelopment and the implementation\nthings like that yeah so\nit's a very gray area there um\nbut\nall this to say arctic rules tend to\nrequire years of experience\nanyway so now that we understand what a\ncloud architect does and sort of what\nyou can expect in terms of like things\nthat you should know how do you go about\nbuilding this skill set well yes i think\nthere's maybe three or four things i can\nprobably say here one is that every\nsingle cloud platform out there is going\nto have an architecture center go spend\na lot of time in them i was recently\njust looking at one\nright before i was working on this video\nbecause i wanted to see some\narchitectures that implement uh\ncontainer apps\noftentimes these architectures will have\ndiagrams alternatives considerations\neven steps on how to implement\narchitecture\ngo take a look at that two is read lots\nand lots and lots and lots of\ndocumentation for example in that\ncontainer\nservice like 10 options for containers\nthat i mentioned for azure you could\nread documentation of all the 10\ncontainer services there are also like\ncomparison docs which will say when to\nuse for example this one on on like when\nto use aks azure kubernetes service over\nazure container instances over container\napps and then you can sort of dial it\ndown and then go read the documentation\non the specific service but hey if you\nhave downtime\nby all means go and read just random\ndocumentation it's great um the third\nthing here would be to experiment on\nyour own in terms of like if you have\nprojects that you've already built and\nyou you know how it works and you know\nthe expected behavior grab one of the\nservices that you're using there and\njust swap it out for a different service\nand see what changes is the\nis it more expensive is it least\nexpensive is it not as efficient what\nanything that you can sort of figure out\nand learn from that\nlearn and document this is my fourth\nrecommendation here\nwrite write a lot because your ability\nto communicate ask questions and to\nexpress and explain your solutions is\ngoing to matter as a solutions architect\nand of course get certified i'm a big\nfan of certifications uh azure has\nsolution architects certifications so\ndoes aws go and take oh so is gcp sorry\ni don't use gcp much as an example\nbecause i don't have any experience with\nit um\nbut it's it's just less important right\nso go get certified um yeah that's\nreally all the recommendations i have uh\ni want to make more videos about cloud\nrules so let me know which ones you're\nlooking for\nand that's it for this video",
