  "transcript": "all right so the simplest way i can\ndefine a cloud engineer is you're the\nperson who makes\nsure a solution is running efficiently\nin the cloud now\nhow early on in the life cycle of a\nsolution you're involved\nin really depends on how your cloud team\nis allocated and structured\nat your company so say it's a small\ncompany\nand there's just you as a cloud person\nthen you're going to be involved from\nthe very beginning you're going to be\nsolution architecting you're going to be\nprovisioning development and staging\nand production environments and testing\nand all the cicd pipelines and once\nit's time to deploy the solution you're\ngoing to make sure that\nall the administration and monitoring\ntasks are set up\nfor success and it's running well and\nthen as there are updates\nto the solution you're going to be\nmaking sure that it still runs the way\nit's supposed to run\nright now being a cloud engineer at\ncompany a\ncould look very different than being a\ncloud engineer at company b\nand it's just the nature of the field at\nthe moment you know the role is still\nrelatively new we're also trying to\nfigure out\nwho does what but at the end of the day\nin every role\nthere's a lot of like even roles outside\nof cloud engineering just think like\nsoftware devs\nsoftware dev company a will look\ndifferent than a software dev\na company b but you can use this to your\nadvantage because\nif say your work at a small company and\nyou end up working on every stage of\nwhat a cloud engineer should be doing\nsay you do some solution architecting\nsay you do some administration\num then you get that hands-on experience\nand you kind of get a feel for what you\nlike doing i know this was my case\ni worked at a place where i got to do a\nlittle bit of everything and\ni ended up realizing that i really like\nsolution architecting\nand now that i'm on my own i'm picking\nup clients where i could specifically do\nsituations and problems and solutions\nwhere i'm\nsolution architecting um so yeah use it\nto your advantage\nit could be sometimes frustrating but\nyou know it is what it is right\nin terms of certifications that i\nrecommend it's hard to give\nsuper general advice but what i will say\nis if you're brand new to the cloud\nget whatever the entry level\ncertification is so for example for\nazure it's the azure fundamentals for\naws it's the certified cloud\npractitioner\nfrom there i recommend looking into\nthe and the associate level uh\nadministrator exam so\nfor azure would be the az-104 and for\naws it would be i believe it's the\nsolution architect\nassociate because those certifications\ngive you\na wide level of high level knowledge\nso you get to play around with a bunch\nof services without necessarily focusing\non anything too much but\nwhile you're studying for that\ncertification kind of get a feel for\nwhich services you enjoyed\nand then which ones you would want to\nfocus in on a little more so maybe you\ntake the az-104 and you realize i really\nlike learning about the developer tools\nor i really liked learning about\nsecurity or i really liked learning\nabout the solution architecting part so\nfrom there\nyou can pick the next certification and\nreally\nlike focus in on the material that you\nenjoy again\nfor giving general advice it's kind of\nhard everyone's in a different stage at\ntheir career but that's i guess\nthe most general advice i can give and\nyou don't have to follow it\nexactly i know personally i'm not\nfollowing my own advice\ni had a few years of hands-on with azure\nand i knew that i really wanted to learn\nabout solution architecting more\nso i'm studying for the 303 and then i\nplan on circling back to the 104\nup so that's just how i'm working but if\ni were to do it again\ni would do 104 and three other if you\nwant to talk cloud\nhit me up on twitter madebygps\nor catch me on a live stream i've been\nstudying a bunch of different topics\nright here on my youtube channel live\nand yeah\ni will see you in the next video thanks\nfor watching",
