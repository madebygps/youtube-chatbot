  "transcript": "hey what's going on everybody today i\nwant to list five mistakes that i've\nseen that are sort of like popular or\ncommon um when people are getting into\ncloud\ni sort of just based this on my\nexperience of being i guess part of the\ncommunity but also working in the space\nfor almost like five years now uh with\nall that being said hi i'm gps and\nwelcome to a new video\nalright so the first one is not using\nbudgets i have several videos about\nbudgets talking about how to implement\nthem and i think like the biggest\nmistake that i made in my cloud\nengineering career was i think i got a\nbill over\nover like a grand maybe a grand two\ngrand because i forgot to\nuh delete resources and i would have\nbeen alerted if i had budgets in place\nbut i didn't have budgets in place right\nso here we are but i would say yes\nabsolutely make sure no matter like what\nquantity of like this is like a\nan account that you use just\nfor development just for playing around\nor anything like that no matter what it\nis\nmake sure you\nuh have a budget in place i'll have a\nvideo i'll throw it up somewhere um\nand you will know how to do that\nbut yeah definitely make sure you\nunderstand how to\nimplement budgets implement budgets and\nhave them in place as well right\nthe next one i would say is not using a\ncli or not having linux skills or\ncommand line skills in general like so\nlet me show you let's switch to my\nscreen here yeah so this is the cli and\ni want to just delete this group delete\nthis uh rbac demo that i just used for a\ndemo right that's literally all i had to\nprovide\ngoodness\nas i make a mistake right uh let's go\nback here i just need to do n i think\nall right then i hit yes and then\nthat'll delete the group versus actually\nme having to go into like\nportal.azure.com\nportalportal.azure.com\nthen signing in\nthen going to\nmy actual resource groups\nthen finding the resources you know make\nsure it's filtered correctly all that\nstuff blah blah blah blah right you get\nwhat i'm trying to say make sure you\nhave uh you know everything that you're\nimplementing with tutorials and when\nyou're getting learned like you're just\ngetting started with cloud and you know\nmaybe you're saying for certification\nwhatever it might be any examples of\nthings that you see done in the portal\nlook up the commands and how to do them\non a terminal on a command line and use\nthose okay solid i have a bunch of\nsessions that i've done for the past\nalmost two months that use a lot of cli\nthings take a look at those alrighty\nmistake number three that i see is\nnot documenting your projects\ni wish i would have had blog posts or\nvideos on every single thing\nthat i did when i got started\nbecause i look back now as like a\ntechnical content creator i look back at\nall the beginner content that i could\nhave created that has so much value\nbecause\nit's extremely weird rare to find\nbeginners creating big content on like\ntheir beginner level like beginner level\ncontent is always by people who are like\nintermediate or higher up there\nuh but like documenting your projects\nand the things that you're getting\nstarted with or doing is extremely\nvaluable and it's also a way for you to\nlook back\non your progress share with others you\nknow develop a portfolio and sort of\ngrow your online presence which i tell\nyou all this all the time i got my job\nat microsoft because of this youtube\nchannel because of the things that have\nhappened around this youtube channel and\ni highly recommend you have a blog or or\nuh you know twitch channel or a youtube\nchannel whatever it might be whichever\nplatform you're comfortable with maybe\nit's tick-tock maybe it's instagram\nwhatever it is\njust document your stuff in some sort of\nway right\num\nyeah do that i have a i have a github\nrepo that sort of has this outline of\nhow to start your own channel in seven\ndays i'll link that somewhere somewhere\nand it's sort of just like this i guess\nday by day kind of program i guess\num well it divides up\nlike all the tasks that you need to do\nover the goal is to get you from nothing\nto a chan to one video published on your\nchannel in seven days so if you are\ninterested in youtube take a look at\nthat\nbut yeah document things like\nwhy you're learning this what challenges\nwhat didn't work what did work things\nthat you want to improve all that kind\nof stuff it's fantastic or maybe explain\nsome concepts whatever you might be\nright\num\nthe next mistake i see a lot that\nbeginners make is not consuming\nnon-tutorial content and this sort of\ngoes into\nthe topic of developing who you are as a\nlike with your people skills like a\nhuman being who's a professional in\ncloud right um i mean by like uh like\nreading books\nare not necessarily tutorials but maybe\nmore about like the business side of\ncloud or um something like i don't know\nthe phoenix project the unicorn project\ntools and weapons um\njust books around technology in general\num in cloud in general\nor podcasts like the cloudcast or\nthere's also\nevery single cloud platform has podcasts\nas well um consuming that kind of saw\nthat isn't something that you just have\nto like step by step by step like\ntutorial but sort of it gives you more\ncontext as to like why services matter\nwhat things or what news things have\nhappened as well it's going to make you\nmore of a well-rounded professional i'm\nnot saying that every single minute you\nhave to sort of fill with this\nnon-tutorial type content but i've been\ni've gotten a lot of value from\nlike podcasts and news and staying up to\ndate with just what's happening and it\nalso helps me\nfear feel fear feel less fomo when it\ncomes to topics around cloud because\nit's like i'm in the know of what's\ngoing on i don't necessarily um i'm not\ngoing to spend time learning it i'm not\ngoing to become a professional every\nsingle thing that happens but i'm in the\nknow when there's an update uh when\nthere's new tech or stuff like that\nright\nso that i think i would say i would\nhighly recommend you not just go down\na rabbit hole of tutorials but you know\ndiversify okay all right the last\nmistake i feel a lot of y'all make um or\na lot of us when\nor when i ma i made as well as a\nbeginner right i'm not trying to put the\nblame on you i'm just trying to give you\na heads up uh it's not participating in\ncommunity\ni'm not saying you have to become like a\ntech twitter influencer or anything like\nthat but you know sharing your stuff\nproviding feedback sort of networking\nwith your peers building sort of this um\nnetwork of people that you\nare like close with online or in the\ncloud space things like that is is\ngenuinely very valuable and it's not\njust like oh the job opportunities that\nyou could get which i've gotten several\nbecause of my presence on like twitter\nand youtube but also like the friends\nand and the colleagues that you can make\nlike for example learntocloud.guide\nwhich we're now turning into a web app\nis being built by with two friends of\nmine antonio and rishab and we all met\nthrough twitter right um a lot of\ncolleague people who are now my\ncolleagues from microsoft i met them on\ntwitter and things like that right so i\nthink you're sort of doing yourself a\ndisservice if you're not at least in the\nknow of these communities that are\navailable there's like there's reddit\nthere's uh twitter there's linkedin\nthere's tick talk there's there's so\nmany sort of cloud communities out there\nthat you can become part of\nand i feel like not not only just like\nknowing more people but like sort of\ngetting your eyes more eyes on your\nstuff um it's for free it's just\navailable for you to do out there why\nnot\ni'm going to throw a sixth one sixth\nthing to this list which is umnot\nwanting to learn to program\ni think when a lot of people sort of try\nto get into i've heard from beginners\nlike i want to get into cloud because i\ndon't want to code or i don't want to\nlike\nlearn how to program and i think you're\nonly doing yourself a disservice um by\nnot understanding like the fundamentals\nof a programming language\nmainly because the things that you can\nbuild with code is just amazing of\ncourse there's other things like low\ncode no code and those kinds of\nsolutions and i'm not saying it's not\nworth learning those things but really\nwhen it comes to like cloud and\nautomating things you're going to be\nusing something like bash or powershell\nor python to script your tasks anyway\nand you're going to learn a lot of\nfundamentals that can lead you into\nprogramming from there and taking like\nan extra step i know it takes a lot of\ntime i'm currently sort of re-learning\nhow to program with russ i told you on\nthe last video\num yeah it takes a lot of time but then\nwhen you can sort of build literally\nanything because you're not a program\nit's going to set you up for success\nright um so i would say like don'tdon't not want to learn how to program\nright um but yeah anyway those are sort\nof my five or six uh things i want you\nall to watch out for\num\nand yeah if you have any questions\nrecommendations comments any of those\nkinds of things you know where to leave\nthem i will see you in the next video",
