  "transcript": "just gave me a hard time I think it\nwould have been the worst experience oh\nI gave you credit for being so bold on\nproduction SQL dude that's like the most\nterrifying thing it feels like whenever\nI like you know log into like a SQL\nServer I'm like I'm walking a tightrope\noh my gosh am I gonna like fall over and\nplay it yeah\nI got too comfortable we're live by the\nway oh okay I think this is a good\nconversation\nbut because I I think uh we all have in\ncommon that earlier on we were sort of\nin an environment where you feel kind of\nsafe\nencouragement might be too big of a word\nbut like you knew if you made a mistake\nlike someone would have your back yes\nand I feel like the earlier you have\nthat the better because then you're just\nempowered to go try try try try and then\nlater on when you move on you go to a\ndifferent role that mentality kind of\nsticks with you so now that I have like\na different team you know a different\nboss I just don't\nfear like oh let's go give something a\ntry because you know you have so many\nexamples of like oh yeah you know what I\ndid make a mistake but I ended up\nfiguring out and then it builds your own\nconfidence very very important\nuh anyway hi everyone welcome\nto the stream uh happy Sunday if it's\nSunday for y'all if not happy whatever\nday it is for you it's probably like\nMonday or something Monday morning or\nsomething\num\nyeah feel free to let us know where\nyou're checking in from in the chat got\nrecipe we've got CJ here I'm gonna give\nCJ everyone knows Bishop so no new for\nintroduction but I'm gonna have a CJ\nlike a couple minutes to introduce\nyourself\nuh and then we'll talk a little bit\nabout what we're up to for today so yeah\nCJ hi thank you for being here my\npleasure yeah so I'm CJ uh if you're on\nthe learn to Cloud Discord you'll\nprobably see uh my face and my name all\nthrough the chain all the time all\nthrough those channels it's just like\ncrazy but um I'm a moderator on uh learn\nto Cloud Discord\num day job I am a cloud operations\nengineer at a education technology\nconsulting company work a lot with AWS a\nlot with ansible a lot with cloud\nformation so you know your IAC your CS\nwhat is it the cicd I I I I I mix up my\nmy uh acronyms all the all the\nabbreviations i i do them sometimes and\num yeah and I think my transition to\nthat has been kind of\ninteresting as far as you know I think I\ntold them off camera that I was\ninitially a music Major so I did\nclassical guitar I wanted to perform\nguitar you know just as a profession you\nknow teach and then I just sort of had\nthis transition where I'm like I don't\nwant to do that anymore what do I do so\nI was Barista for a long time and got\nanother job I got fired from that job\nand like what do I do now I have no like\nbackup or anything like that and then\num a family friend took a chance on me\ndoing support desk he's like no\nexperience no problem come on in and\nthen\nthat kind of just led to my you know\nmore happy accidents in career directory\nto become a cloud Ops engineer so that's\nthat's my intro there nice well\nshould you being here and all the\nanswers you provide some very\ninvolved answers it's not just like yes\nno like you you can tell that you take\nyour time so we really appreciate that\nand it's very helpful for the community\nso we have right here\nthanks for the solid answers on the\nserver CJ so\nof course we want to have I want to have\nyou on the stream for a while but the\nthing about these live streams is that\nI'm never organized it's always last\nminute I'm always like worship like hey\ndo you want to stream like 15 minutes\nbefore and he's always like sure so we\nend up doing them but I would like to\nhave 2023 the resolution is to be more\norganized with these live streams but\nanyway\num we're here to answer questions and\nthen oh we got someone else here\nuh I'll add them in a second but we're\nhere to answer questions but most\nimportantly we're here to work on some\nstuff and get some people some so\nfirst-hand exposure on\nwhat it is that do different devops and\nCloud tasks and we're going to use learn\nto Cloud as an example here so\nshould we first we should first probably\nexplain what we're gonna do\nyeah that's okay yeah probably yeah hold\non so\nlet's bring up a\nlike a diagram should we should diagram\nthis uh what's what's the useful way to\ndo thiswhiteboard Microsoft whiteboard is\namazing like uh Shameless plug\nbecause you know I can collaborate with\nyoulet me find let me see I should have\nthat because I have 365 let me see uh\nthat would be cool I can so I could send\nboth a few links to it right yeah that'd\nbe great\nand I have to let my dog out one second\nthere might be a couple uh extra guests\non the stream if I don't do this\ngo ahead I'm gonna figure out where it\nis\nwhere is Microsoft whiteboard hold on\nwhiteboard\nsorry I was muted search in the browser\nit should show up if it's not installedoh apps\nyeah sway people Skype safety\nrewards whiteboard\nI used it for\nteaching\nokay hold on\nI got it free start work it is free can\nI use it in the browser yeah right yes\nyou can use it in the browser\n[Music]\nyeah here's a tip\nif you want to get better\num at drawing stuff like so you know I\nused to teach but you cannot\ndraw stuff really good with the mouse so\nwhat I would do is open whiteboard on my\nPC and then open one in my iPad on\nbrowser and then use my\niPad as like a drawing board it worked\namazing\nit's good to know well I mean right now\nit's not\nit's not a browser anymore hold on no no\nI just sent it to you oh so I can draw\nhere yes okay yes okay cool hold on yeah\nNicholas hello Nicholas hey can you hear\nme yeah\nawesome\nwelcome welcome how are you give us a\ngive us a quick introduction of you\nyeah uh my name is Nicholas\num\nmy name is Nicholas and I have been uh\nnit for two years I'm a CIS admin right\nnow at MSP and uh yeah it's fun it's\nbeen fun I like it we're um sis Adam is\nthat your first I.T job\nno my first it job I was a field service\ntechnician and I'm at another MSP okay\ndid uh what's your educational\nbackground\num I I have too many degrees I have I\nhave an undergrad I have an undergrad\ndegree in a liberal in a liberal arts\nmajor I was a black Studies major and\nthen I went on to uh to grad school for\nsecondary education okay cool cool did\nyou did you kind of know that that's not\nwhat you wanted to pursue in a career or\nwas it out of like necessity that you\nswitched into it or I switched into it\nbecause I was I was just really stressed\nI've been wanting I wanted to have a\nbetter quality of life and I knew I\nwasn't going to get that teaching in\npublic schools uh in New York city so I\noh you're in New York made the switch\nYeah\nI don't live it I don't live in New York\nCity but uh you know I live close enough\nthat I work and play in New York City\nyou can consider it New York City yeah I\nfeel the same I actually don't know what\nNew York City is it just Manhattan\nis that what it's it's considered it's\nconsidered so New York City is\nconsidered the Bronx Manhattan Brooklyn\nQueens and Staten Island that's the city\nokay so I guess I technically am I'm in\nLos Angeles I'm Queens all right cool\nyeah anyway welcome\nrishab do you know Nicholas\nno from the uh from from discard yeah\nyeah yeah my my name is chain links in\nthe in Discord yeah yeah okay cool\nbecause I think I know you're from\nLinkedIn to Nicholas I think we are\nconnected there oh yeah I think we are\nyeah yeah the thing about the internet\nis I don't be knowing anyone's name I'd\nbe knowing you yeah yeah yeah I'm like\nis that chain links hold on yeahsee that's what I'm not really good at\nis like everywhere my name is rishab\nKumar seven that's it yeah it's easy to\nfind me yeah no me too if someone tries\nto do like opsec on me it's really easy\nto find stuff\nI know it's like awesome like I don't\nknow Richard if you have like trouble\neven like trying to figure out like a a\npseudonym or like some name that you\nwant to give yourself you're like what\ndo I do Elite code seven I don't even\nknow I don't even know yeah I used to do\nit earlier like Reddit and you know\ngaming stuff I would call myself\nDeadpool because I'm a huge fan but then\nthat name is most of the time taken so\nyeah chain links is the name that I've\ngot that I've kind of like just kept on\nfrom my childhood definitely like my\nfriends in high school used to call me\nand uh yeah that's just kind of stuck\nand similarly whenever I make accounts\nanywhere chain links is always taken\nlike okay guys yeah I'm the real chain\nlink guys\nI'm the real one all right cool so we're\ngonna whiteboard out what we're gonna be\nworking on today sweet oh I put the link\nif you hit the private chat the\nWhiteboard link is there so you'll be\nable to open it got it but what I have\nin mind is sort of like I guess we oh my\ngoodness I'm I'm so bad at drawing maybe\nwe use air like like this like this is\nour cicd pipeline I guess gotcha and\nthen\num where is our Tech where's the text go\noh here we go\nso we'll call this CI CI CD on on Main\nokay\nuh yeah whoops why how do I grab this\nindividual okay I've never used this\nbefore\nthis this Microsoft whiteboard I was\ngoing to use um\nwhat's the the one that looks like hand\nhandling yeah yeah that's the one yeah\nbut I guess this one's good too\nsouh let's see what else we have to do\nokay so hold on I guess I can select I\ncan't multi-select yes in one no\noh my goodness okay so what I want to do\nis duplicate all this\nis a way to grab it like uh just hit\ncontrol I thinkand then you'll get a box and then use\nthat box to likecopy awesome yes okay so\nat the moment what we've got going on is\nwe have\nour our app our code our source code\nfor\nlive for like uh Version Control lives\non GitHub so that's if you go to\ngithub.com forward slash learn to Cloud\nforward slash learn to Cloud I think\num or if you go to our websites on the\ntop let's go there it's this thing did\nwe fix that Discord link\nno no but anyway here uh so this this is\nour source code right so this is the\nlearn to Cloud application so that lives\non nope right here that lives on GitHub\nhere\nnow we have a cicd pipeline that when we\nhave pushes to our main branch so\nbranches in in git in general I guess\nnot just specific to GitHub allow you to\nhave multiple copies of your same code\nbut that way that enables collaboration\nso I can have my own Branch where I'm\nworking on something Richard can have\nhis own Branch where he's implementing\nsomething else and that way our main\nbranch is just what is meant to be\ndeployed to our production environment\nin azure no\nif this was like a small application\nwhere it's only Richard and I working\nthe entire time\neven then I don't think just having\nMaine is enough\nuh usually you have\nlike just a bunch of different branches\nand then when you're done implementing\nwhatever it is that you're implementing\nper Branch you'll remove it you'll merge\ninto Main and whatnot but\nwhat we want to end up doing now is we\nwant to enable\nuh people who want to get a Hands-On\nwith clouds Junior entry level whatever\npeople who are new to cloud and need\nproduction experience we want to create\na staging environment Within are are I\nguess learn to Cloud application\nor devops practice whatever\nso people can merge their uh their own\nso they'll open up a PR we can merge\nthat to a staging environment first and\nthen that'll be a staging branch and\nthen we'll have cicd that we'll push to\na staging environment so the actual if\nyou when you go to learn to cloud.guide\nnothing is impacted there because that's\njust showing what the main branch is\nbut this also gives people the\nopportunity to okay you merge something\nyou can see it in production you can see\nit working but none of the traffic is\nactually going to that application\num now\nright before we went live we I was like\nyou know what I don't know how so again\nthis is going to be we're gonna call\nthis like cicd on staging something like\nthis\nso this is pretty much pretty\nstraightforward because essentially you\nreplicate what you have here but now\nwhat we have to also figure out is okay\nso once we everything passes on staging\nhow do we get that back up to our main\nso that's what we're going to be\nfiguring out today\nin terms of like Tech this is\nGitHub actions which is yaml\nthat's it right that's all\nyes that's the only thing we're going to\nbe using today we might have some other\nPR depending on how long it takes us\nlike I mentioned right before going live\nwe were like this is the thing we can do\nright and everyone was like we could\nprobably figure this out so this is the\ngoal for today's to figure this out if\nwe can't figure it out at some point we\nwill maybe we'll have to do another\nstream maybe we won't accomplish it\ntoday we might figure it out in 10\nminutes and then we can go to taking a\nlook at other PRS that we have open\nother issues or just hang out and chat\nwe have usually we just do these streams\nbetween Richard but myself but I've\nalways wanted to have more\nuh you know friends I've learned a cloud\nor community members on here so we have\nNicholas here we have CJ here people who\nare always in the chat kind of like are\nalways in the Discord answering\nquestions participating\num so should be cool\nuh we have a question ready you're gonna\nanswer this one are you following a\nparticular branching strategy like git\nflow for example\nyeah\num this one is for I think it's called\ngithub's workflow let me find it out\num this is the ex exact strategy that we\nused for any of the devops uh related\nSource control code that we had in my\ndevops gig I researched I think and I\nwrote like a really big article on this\nfor for that company on like different\ngit strategies and why this is the best\nbecause we didn't have you know\nlike 15 or 20 developers working at a\ntime we won't have bugs because all of\nthese not\nas in we won't have bugs but we the the\nproducts that we created are the tools\nthat we created were used by internal\nteams it was not customer facing so we\nknew that we won't have yeah we won't\nhave much uh branches or issues that we\nwill be working on uh being said that we\nalready kind of follow this with with\nour learn to cloud is I know Gwen needs\nto get better at this but\num I'm not I'm not following me outshe she owns LTC so she can merge to\nmain directly I get it but\nno I didn't I did say last live stream\nthat I promise I'm going to stop work\nbecause my issue is like I I think\nbecause this past year it's all just\nbeen you know docsify GitHub Pages yes\nI've cared less so it's like oh just do\nit straight to main but that is not what\nyou should do don't follow my example\nwith Gwen I trust her that she won't\nbreak prod\num\nyeah she she is you know responsible and\nbut yeah for any of the community stuff\nor the these issues that I might be\nworking with or even Gwen or CJ or\nNicholas will be working on what we do\nis there should be an issue open firstly\nin GitHub and you either take the ticket\nname or the issue name and name your\nbranch\num with the same name whatever the issue\nis so today we will be working on you\nknow staging environment for Azure\nstatic web apps so we'll name our branch\nthat and then once the pr is created it\ngets merged to main\num the thing is I added that we do have\nPRS that can be seen as previews in\nstatic web apps because static web apps\nsupport that uh the good thing about\nthat is you get as soon as you create a\nPR you get an email with the static web\napp link that we did saw in the last\nlive stream\nuh I think so yeah yeah we didn't show\nthat yeah okay\num but\nwhat we want to do is read like an\nEnterprise level get strategy where\nnothing gets merged to Main\nbefore it has been to the staging and\nhas been tested\num so in the future we'll definitely\nbuild some tests that will be written\nagain in GitHub actions that are\nperformed on the staging\num\nenvironment so for example one of the\ntests could be scraping all the phases\nand looking for you know if the content\nexists or not right every phase does\nload or not uh the translations are\nworking the URL paths are working it'll\ntake time but this is the vision we have\nfor learn to cloud and\num it starts with the correct get\nstrategy\num yeah yeah definitely if you\nuh have hope of\nlike a want to get into like a devops\nrelated role or even like something like\na junior Cloud developer maybe\ndeveloper-centric devops Centrics kind\nof role understanding how git and like\nstaging environments different\nenvironments works and like cicd and all\nthese types of things is important uh so\nwe hope to give you a kind of like\ninsight into how that works right now\nwe're not experts we have Acro I mean\nlet me take a look we got assist admin\nhere we got a cloud Ops engineer and\nwe've got two people in Deborah so we're\ngonna we're gonna I don't know it seems\nlike it seems like like the beginning of\na joke yeah you think how many yeah how\nmany people will it take to uh get a PR\nworking yeah\nuh but yeah everyone do a favorite hit a\nlike on the stream I like to set goals\nfor live streams so let's try to hit 50\npeople live it's Sunday night I know\nmost people probably like relaxing but\ndo me a favor hit a like share the\nstream with people uh and then metaphor\nwho's always in the Discord chat is here\nas well saying what's up so what's up\nmetaphor\num cool so Richard do you want to share\nI guess I can share\nwhat what we currently have so again\nyeah we can start with that GitHub repo\nuh again if you go to our site it's on\nthe top you can just hit GitHub top\nright here\nand as you can see I'm on Main here if\nwe go into where is where I guess I can\ngo into click GitHub here the dot GitHub\nfolder and then go into workflows these\nare all our cicd full uh actions and the\none that is for our main branch that\npushes to\nour application in production it's this\ntop one uh what is it called\nuh Azure static web apps agreeable\nForest it's it was it was generated by\nAzure static web apps now as you can see\nit will run when there's a push to the\nmain branch so it's only working on this\none right uh it's pretty straightforward\nactually and then it ends up in azure\nhold on a second let me open up my\nportal let's switch to this view here\nlet me open up my portal and I can see I\nhaven't checked how much I like to do\nthis thing where I check daily the price\nof or in a cloud\nlet's take a look at it and then I can\nshow you where the stuff is deployed\nuh switch\nholding where is this this one yeah here\nwe go Okay so we've had on average this\nis\nI think this is past five minutes no\nwhat is this\npass where's the time oh okay past five\nminutes 693 sight hits\nin the last 48 hours we've had\n37\n560 and then the last week we've had\n181 000 side hits so that doesn't is\ncited and actual visits are different\nbecause you can have multiple side hits\num per page but on average just kind of\ngive us this idea how much traffic we\nhad around the 10th we peaked around the\n10th at 11 30 and then it's been pretty\nsteady since then\nso\nlet's take a look at the resource Group\nand I can take a look at how much does\nthis cost so far\nuh uh where is cost analysis herelet's give this a second we want to make\nthis page uh we found an API that'll\nhelp us make this public so we can have\nupdates every like 24 hours and people\ncan take a look so all right it costs\nthree dollars so far in our forecast\nRichard remember I said it was gonna be\n30 a month it's for 21.33\nif we keep sort of similar traffic I\nhave a feeling that we're going to\nprobably get more so I still think this\nnumber is going to hit 30. uh our most\nexpensive region is the uss2 then U.S\nCentral and then U.S West too it's a\npretty big difference between these yeah\num these two here\nwhereas I think it'll hit that fifty\ndollars\num I think we're gonna hit 50.\nyeah yeah what we are at January 15 we\nare already halfway thereuh yeah you're right but the fork our\nforecast saystwenty one dollars twenty one dollars\nmaybe February we'll hit 50 I don't know\nso my goal is to I get a hundred dollars\nmonthly credit\nso we can hit that fine I think that'll\nget us a long way\nbut once we go over that then I'm gonna\nstart being like okay\nthis is turning into a full-time jobuh James says learning devops myself\nit's awesome it's awesome nice uh let's\nsee Okay cool so let me get this off\nscreen and then you can kind of take\nover to see where you're at but as you\nas always people feel free to ask us\nquestions\nfeel free to ask us questions in the\nchat\num we're here to hang out and get some\nstuff going let me get my stream yard to\nthe side\nuh we got a question here\nwould this mean you would have a branch\nfor each Dev environment stitching one\nstaging two prod Azure web apps for each\nand no one would be able to push domain\nkind of the goal is to have so the same\nstaging environment like we can have\nmultiple branches for whatever reason\nbut we'll have one branch that will\nalways be like the staging environment\nand then that is what people will merge\ntheir PRS into I guess we will merge\nPowers into and then that goes that sort\nof puts the code through all the proper\ntests and things like that and then it\nends up in like that staging environment\nand then that I guess that gets promoted\nto Maine yeah yeah so yeah\num so you won't have staging one stating\ntwo branches you will have staging but\nthen your branch name can be anything\nand that also goes with the environment\nso you the dev environment is called\nstaging so we won't have you know like I\nsaw the example say staging one stating\ntwo and prod\num whereas we only have two environments\none will be prod and then one will be\nstaging\num the reason being because\nas I just said you can have previews in\nstatic websites so each PR that gets\ncreated you'll get your own preview even\nunder the staging environment so I don't\nthink we have the need to have stating\none setting two and prod uh instead\nwe'll just have the the concept we have\nin mind is Dev and me like prod so Dev\nis where all the changes get pushed gets\ntested everyone who created a PR will\nhave their own preview they can look at\nit they can ask for the feedback right\nand then so that is what we are trying\nto get away from is people\num you know\ncontributing and having to run it\nlocally and then asking for feedback you\nknow you as soon as you merge it to\nstaging or open a PR first stating\nyou'll get your own preview that you can\nshare publicly with\nthe LTC community on this card and get\nfeedback that would be sick because like\nI think the the sort of friction between\nlearning anything in Tech that isn't web\ndev is you know when you create a\nwebsite like you can kind of like\ninstantly see what you've done in cloud\nand in like operations and devops all\nthose types of I guess Fields is tough\num to kind of replicate that same kind\nof not not instant gratification but\nthat kind of that visual feedback so if\nwe can have you know these environments\nthat as soon as you make a change and\nyou can see it live like oh I made this\nlike I worked on this I think that would\nbe really cool someone asked about\nuh good evening are you using any track\nany tools to track changes slash files\nyou're looking to push and yeah if you\ngo to learn a cloud on the top left here\nyou have LDC roadmap and this has uh\nthat leads you to a GitHub project that\nhas all the issues that we have on\nright now we probably have to add some\nmore in here\nso what we're look what we're working on\ntoday is this one here\noh my bad\num okay no no worries yeah we're working\non number 88.\nwow we're already at 88. wow okay yeah I\nopened the pr today it's an it's the 100\nPR how lucky I'm what we should we\nshould\nchooseI'll bring to that once it's getting\nworried\nwhat is it what is it oh it's the edit\nthis page feature that opens a PR now\noh you did it already yes it was it was\neasy after I read the documentation read\ndocumentationwell maybe we'll get to that after we\nfigure this out but yeah if anyone wants\nto sort of hop on any issues just leave\na comment there hey I would love to to\nwork on this one uh and then we can help\nfacilitate that work as well okay cool\nuh uh Richard you want to share your\nscreen\nokay yeah\num just to go back to Jared's question\nuh I shared the link in the\nYouTube chat I don't know if links would\nwork but yeah this is the strategy We\nare following or really close to the\nstrategy\num the good flow so I'll just show\nquickly the diagram here so this is how\nit works you get the idea we built a\npretty similar diagram on Microsoft\nwhiteboard that Gwen was sharing\num so the purple branches here shows you\nthe staging in our case and then\num the V the version one here you can\nsee is like the prod for this particular\nexample that they're showing so main\nwill be proud always and then anything\nany feature that anyone wants to work on\nwill be the purple branch that you can\nsee on the diagram if anybody is\ninterested they can look into this about\nthe git workflow that\nI'm not I'm not gonna I'm not gonna\nmerge your PR until you close your tabsdo you see the windows at the bottom now\nyeah hold on let me move this this thing\nhere along this wait now which one is it\nI guess it's this one here no tell me do\nall of those have like 50 tabs as well\nyeah not all of them\nthis is this is the main window okay\ngood yeah\num so let's open GitHub I just wanted to\ngo over the\naction and let me know if it's too small\nyeah it's too small okay let me open up\nthe workflow here real quick[Music]\nis it good\ndo like two moreI think that's good I am yeah\nokay chat chat let us know if you can\nsee that fine\nokay\nso\nthis is how yaml looks for people who\nare not familiar with the yaml uh\nlike the visuals and in the syntax and\nso I can quickly go over so as you know\nthe action name suggests it's the Azure\nstatic web apps CID CD right and you can\nsee\num the branches it's currently looking\nat is just main right so if there is\nuh any pull request that's to the main\nbranch it creates a preview for it\nbefore it can deploy it to\nthe actual main site and then any push\non the branch itself like you know we\nwere talking how\num so let's say Gwen has a really quick\ntypo that she wants to change so she can\ndo that to the main and it will deploy\nthat or this action will run\num for that uh change that Gwen did\nand talking about jobs these are the\nactual jobs that the the GitHub GitHub\nactions is responsible of running\nso you can see a couple of Secrets being\nimported here\num so we don't want to disclose any of\nthe secrets so we use\num there is a functionality built within\nGitHub repository that you can store\nyour secrets in and you can access those\nby calling secrets.github or secret\nstart whatever your\nenvironment variable is\nso our application is root so all of the\ndocosaurus stuff resides in root so it\nusually looks for package.json right now\nsince it's a react app and it looks at\nthe output location called build so if\nwe do a npm build right now locally what\nit does is it gives us a build folder in\nroot that contains all of the website\ncontents that you see on learn to Cloud\nso that build is what gets pushed to the\nstatic web apps in azure\nand you can clearly tell there is no\nmention of the different environments\nthat you want to set up\num different branching strategies that\nwe were talking about is just only\nconcerns made right now so if I I have\npushed my code to implement CI CD Dev\nenvironments so this is what we were\ntalking about so you people can have\ndifferent branches named according to\nthe feature that they're working on\nand\nyou can see already there is a change in\nthe uh action here where the branch is\nnow included are both Main and staging\nright so now anytime a push\nis sent to the staging Branch it will\ndeploy\nthose changes to the staging Branch now\nwhat we have to figure out is the\nenvironment part of it so how does that\ncreate get created in the Azure static\nweb apps that we have to deploy\na new\nenvironment in the portal or do we just\nrun this action and it will do that for\nusbecause it's the same\nstatic web app right if we create what\nif we created\nno because ideally we wouldn't want to\nhave to create another app we would just\noh wait no let me think about this\nbecause the thing is that you're still\nusing the same web apps API token and\nthat's what I'm curious about like if\nyou're using the same token to deploy is\nit going to just rewrite over learn to\ncloud and then like your your learn to\nCloud uh dot guys like oh my gosh yeah\nso as far as I'm aware the static web\napps has environments\num\nlike the environments uh functionality\nbuilt into it as far as I'm aware I\ncould be completely wrong but so far\nso\nI I read this on the action\ndocumentation\num the GitHub action documentation that\nI was building uh\nso this is where you see the so this is\nthe Azure portal for learn to cloud and\nyou can already see the previous\nenvironment so you see that yesterday I\nadded the discard link and as soon as I\ncreated a PR it created a preview for it\nand you can basically look at it and\nsame thing for the edit page feature\ntoday but as you can see the environment\nright now we only have production here\nso that's what I'm not sure about is can\nwe have staging in hereJames asks a good question no we need\ntwo Azure stat Azure exactly rightyeah that's what I was thinking about\nlast night like I woke up in the middle\nof night like what yeah\ncold sweat oh my gosh yeah\nthat's all we'll do what I usually do at\nmy job is Googling yes we have a we have\na while you do some Google's rishab we\ngot a questionnaire which one is\nbeginner friendly python to go CJ you\nsaid you do python I would say yeah\npython is very beginner friendly\num yeah I think it's just easy to read\nand understand\num yeah I think you can't really go\nwrong with python and honestly what what\nkind of job are you looking for Ali I\nthink that the also a question too I\nmean it's good to have a base language\nbut then you know if you want to build\noff of that I mean you can you can go to\ngo I've tried to experiment with go a\ncouple of times\num it's sort of it's a similar\nit goes you know it's really it's really\nhard to hard to say to be honest I mean\nit's it's great I love it but it's on it\nit's hard when you're I'm sure I don't\nknow Glenn you're probably like doing\nthis I know you're doing like rust and\nstuff too but sometimes it's hard when\nyou have a language that you know and\nyou kind of work with it day to day and\nthen there's that one where you're like\nI'm kind of doing stuff with it but like\nI'm not really like learning to that\nlike next level to become even more\nproficient so I'm just kind of like in\nthis tutorial land I feel like I'm kind\nof in tutorial and with go I feel like\nyeah I find it hard to\nfind some like actual application to use\nit for outside of just like learning I\nthink that was\nhow I became proficient with C sharp was\nbecause I was using it at work and then\nI could actually see like in a real\nlike it's like in production like how\nit's actually working and I would also\nhave feedback from other Engineers but I\nthink that's why a language like python\nis great for for getting started because\nthere's just so much community so much\noh for sure and I don't want to I don't\nwant to even just tell Ollie not to\nlearn go as a first language I mean look\npeople have different first languages\nall the time some people learn Java some\npeople learn C sharp some people Learn\nPython I think\nhonestly kind of go with your gut you\nknow which one you want to choose\nsometimes it's almost just like what do\nyou like like what what what are you\ndrawn to what do you want to learn more\nsometimes as well so yeah\nI'm going to get wrong answers only all\nright you got to learn command prompt\nand Powershell\nyou've got to learn basicallydo you have a any program experience or\nwhat's like I'm sure you do some\nscripting\num I I'm basically just trying to you\nknow become a Powershell wizard right\nnow that's great you know like uh I I\nactually do really enjoy it it sounds\nlike sadomasochism to say you enjoy\npower Zone it makes no sense sometimes\nbut yeah what about it do you enjoy and\nI like like let's get into the details\nI think what I enjoy is that I'm just\ndiscovering how powerful it is you know\nit's kind of like that that honeymoon\nstage like oh wait I can do this in\nPowershell you know what I mean so\nthat's that's kind of where I'm at\nthat's awesome yeah yeah and uh at the\nMSP do you have any like a cloud\nexposure\noh yeah I mean I uh for a lot of our\nclients they're kind of there's they're\nmoving into into the cloud to Azure\nspecifically uh so like you know right\nnow\num a lot of a lot of the clients that\nI'm I'm supporting they're they're on\nPrem but you know they're they're slowly\nmoving to the cloud and I I hope to be a\npart of a lot of those those projects\nI've already expressed interest in doing\nthat\num but I do see the Azure portal pretty\nfrequently in Office 365 pretty much\nevery day I do like active directory\nstuff oh yeah yeah I mean active\ndirectory Azure portal and then\nPowershell you got like a powerful combo\nthat when you do move into more more\nAzure stuff yeah yeah I mean that's kind\nof like the bread and butter especially\nPowershell you can do everything\nperfect yeah I I query the things I\nquery Azure active director for\nPowershell all the time I find that\namazing that's awesome you know yeahexecutive directory but this is why I\ntell people all the time is when you go\nto the portal and you go to any open up\nany service in Azure I don't care what\nwhatever it is\non the left side there's always a space\nfor active directory because identity is\npart of absolutely everything and if you\ncan know it in and out especially if you\ncan automate it\nyou're good yeah you saw it well he says\nPowershell is your best friend and help\ndesk I did um not Powershell\nwhat's there's like another one uh\nbefore Pop I guess it's command prompt\nyeah maybe that's just like that's CMD\nright yeah yep yeah yeah yeah I think\nyou can make batch files yeah\nI had a friend who did a lot of that and\nthen I then I remember thinkingI'm A bash person uh cool so\nyeah do a click Ops on that button CJ\nhey there you goBishop how are we doing I\nmean yeah walk us through your like okay\nyeah walk us through your like Google\nfood like what are you doing I'm already\nat Reddit so you can seeit it is not going well\num okay I'll tell you where I'm at right\nnow before we read this Reddit post\num\nso I did find out and shout out to\nAnthony\nhe did have a tutorial on\num I don't go in knows Anthony oh yeah\nyeah shout out Anthony yeah\num he did a tutorial on Azure devops and\nAzure static web apps so turns out when\nyou pick Azure devops as your deployment\nsetting hereand I show you what I mean by that is\nand you set up pipelines you can set\ndirectly staging and production from the\npipeline settings that's it we're moving\nover to Azure devops\nF GitHub napkin\nso\ndoes it show somewhere I think I saw\nthis too when I Googled\nyeah yeah so you can also password\nprotect which is Awesome by the way um\nyour\nyou know\nmarriage thing like what's getting\npushed out\nand this is how it looks for\nthe\nAzure devops side so I think I we can\nfind the hack to make this happenum because\nwhat static web apps does mention is if\nyou go here and you look at stating\nenvironments it says automatically\ncreate a new staging environment with\npull request which we already are doing\nthe thing is those pull requests are\nagainst Main\nso\nto\nGwen's point or someone I think\nmentioned in the chat too that we might\nneed two static web apps the two okay\nwhich wouldn't be a big deal because\nthere's no traffic hitting it so it's\nprobably going to be very inexpensive\nyeah we won't have and the good thing\nabout that is we could have something\nlike you know\ndev.learn to cloud.com[Music]\ninstead of you know those random URLs\nthat you get and also we can leave it on\nlike the lowest uh tier of static web\napps because you know you're just here\nto just look at the changes and stuffso will it create a new so I know you're\nsaying how it'll create all those new\nlittle step static web apps every time\nsomebody does a uh request or I'm sorry\ndoes the pr so is that going to do that\nagainst the stage if we do a new web app\nit's just going to do it against that\none instead of me okay exactly and then\nwe can\nturn off turn this off on our production\nwebsite like we don't need staging\nenvironments\nhow do I get the\nfix we want in Maine to Maine from\ncontributors\nthat's when you merge from staging to\nprod or like to main so that's the next\nstep we have to figure out PR on staging\nwould that be from us or we have the\nsame user like okay now open that\noh I see what you're saying sorry no no\nI didn't get it okay cool so we have\nokay let's say CJ opens\num a PR and we we put it against staging\nright it goes into staging it it goes to\nDev dollar into cloud.guide right so\nit's there but what about the awesome\nfeature that CJ made that's now in\nstaging we want to get it to Maine how\ndoes that happen so either we can have\nautomated testing in a GitHub action\nthat tests all this stuff on the staging\nenvironment and then merges that to Dev\nor to main or we can have manual\napprovers like you and me who click on\nthe button to merge those staging\nchanges so I remember this happened\nwith us but we needed a manual reviewer\nevery time\num so at least one human being who\npresses yes merge staging to prod so we\ncan go through that approach right which\nwill cause\num the community like there will be some\nweight for\nthe community members to see their\nfeature in prod it won't be like rapid\nbut again\nI don't know how much that's you know if\nit's worth the extra minutes and saving\nus the hassle of merging malicious code\nyeah yeah no I think the manual is a\ngreat uh idea recipient like this is\nalmost like a good principle of like you\nautomate until it hurts like you're like\nyou don't have to automate yet but you\ncan wait until it becomes like I don't\nknow what the what what's the problem\ngoing to be when we were like crap we\nhave like 500 people wanting to merge\ninto learn to Cloud right now and how do\nwe all like I'm gonna click through\neverything I I guess you could see the\ncould you see that happening\neverywhereI think it's also a good\nfilter Gwen\nto not get those like especially like\nokay let's talk about Oktoberfest let's\nsay we get 50 PRS all of those 50pers if\nwe have automated testing and automated\nmerging to main will get included to our\nproduction website\nright so in those cases I think manual\ndoes save us because we can be like oh\nno like we don't want this even though\nlike tests went good and stuff but this\nwas not a significant change or you know\nthis is what we are looking towards\ngotcha okay makes sense\nand if we get burdened\nI feel like we do have you know good\nCommunity contributors who we can add as\nyou know CJ yeah exactly like mods on\nbusiness\nas mods on GitHub this is our way of\nsaying that you're going to start\napproving peers\nI was Googling it's okay\nokay so I'm gonna\nmake sure we\ndraw this out\nso stagingLTC\nl2c no\nI usually say I I usually use T to\nabbreviate LTC\nwell I kind of like that too but that\nkind of sounds like a like a sports\ndrink\nit kind of looks like a\ndo we want to launch a sports drink\nthere's like an oh learn to hydrate oh\nmy gosh yes\nfor your long study sessions oh yes\nit's over once again\nbest period will learn to Cloud guideoh that's hilarious look at us I'll wait\nfor that PR to come\n[Laughter]any questions that we missed here I feel\nlike a souluh no I think we're good\nadminthis is the closest I could get\nto a user yeah oh yeahumso how do you feel about the\narchitecture Gwen\nhow do I feel about the architecture I\nfeel like it makes\nperfect senseI got the mod hold on\nI got the motto for when you get into\nthe bottled water business straight from\nthe classI feel like now we have to do it because\nit's like uh it's like a bit now\nthat's hilarious\nit's great I love that that's how we pay\nthe hosting Bill yes bottles yeah get\nlike the you know like oh yeah\nat some point that's what I was thinking\nthe other day of like oh if this does\nbecome like above like my my monthly\ncredit like well how are we gonna tackle\nthat because we don't ever want to make\nanything paid but moving into like\ndonation land is then you got to be like\nan LLC and all that kind of stuff gotcha\nand then there's paperwork and taxes\nyeah how does the like the GitHub\nsponsorship thing works like you know\nhow you have GitHub sponsors yeah yeah I\nthink you need to set up as some some\nkind oh you have yeah like fill out text\nstuff\npaperworkbut we'll probably have to\nfigure that kind of stuff out\num for now we're good but I don't know\nhow long okay\nso this is where we are uh right now\ncool PR's PRS that so instead of Maine\nit shouldn't just connect up\nso human yeah like it should be the the\nstuff that I was building here yeah yeah\nthat should push into that yeah yeah\nit's so hard to edit thisiPad works so great because you can\ntouch stuff\nI use draw.io for my diagrams yeah yeah\nI used to use that a lot\num but I was telling Nicholas I was\ntelling Gwen prior to this\num so when I was teaching I used this\nbecause it was free and it has a team's\nintegration\num and then I would open like the same\ntab on my iPad and can like hand draw\nreally good yeah\nyeah I could see how that could be\nconvenient for sure\nyeah and now it's all messed upyeah we Windows really needs better\nlike touch\nfirst devices like an iPad like I have\nthe um\nthe surface book three it's supposed to\nbe like a really high-end machine but\nthat thing is crap\ndon't get me started on surfaces man\nyeah they're like I don't know what they\ncan't get right with those things but I\nmean there's a lot of potential I feel\nlike because you have like native\nhardware and then native operating\nsystem yeah kind of like the Mac\nyeah I think yeah I'm really excited\nabout like arm stuff now with yeah the\nlike the dev kit that they build looks\namazing because it's only like what 600\n500.\num with 32 gigs of RAM and I've been\nseeing good reviews about it so\num\nbut yeah I use surface 3 I think it was\npretty old\num\nlike it always sounded like a jet engine\nI don't know why even though it was not\nturn it on yeah yeah it's like it's just\nevery\ntime it's on the because it's supposed\nto be a talent as well the the placement\nof like the headphone jack is on like\nthe top of the screen on the top here\nyeah so your whole wire runs this whole\nthing of just being it's like so\nuncomfortable\nit's very uncomfortable but\nshout out to service team\na lot of love for y'all I'm sure you'll\nfigure it out a lot of potential there\nuh what do you drink peered with the\ncloud cloud to brain easy oh my goshthat's the contender right there\nI like the straight from the clouds\nthat's a really good one that's a really\ncatchy one\nokaydid we get it\nyeah I think this looks good oh it was\ntoo much work so I'm notI know I stuck this intoohcool\nyou can just draw I think it's better to\njust drawnice gotcha a lot more elegant you knowthat is justI'm not really good at knowing when it's\nsarcasm and when it's like actual actual\nyou know\ncompliment it's constructive sarcasm\nyeah that's awesome okayum so yeah I think the next step would\nbe\nto create the static web app okayand me changing my Branch locally to the\none that I was working on uh got it\nkind of leads in nicely to how you have\nit deployed to begin with so then we can\nsee yeah I'm not even sure how I guess\nthe how you guys do aiac or anything\nlike that so this will be great\nuh\nyeah so we don't need this so\nyeah I think Gwen will need another\naction that deploys to staging\nand\num yeah and then we will need to edit\nthis action to only deploy to main once\nstaging is donewait hold on I'm confused we need an\naction that will deploy to staging\nso but when we generate uh a new app\nwe'll have that\nso yeah\nthe other part is we remove staging uh\nwe remove previews from the main site\nso we remove previews from this site so\num this pull request block that you see\nhere\nwe I think we can completely remove that\nno\nbecause we will still yeah we will still\nmerge from Dev\nor staging but then that means it's a\npush to main so yeah I think we can\nremove this entire chunk\nbut\nthat means every we're gonna have to go\nthrough staging as well that makes sense\nyeah everyone goes through staging yes\nand then still you need a human uh\napproval to be merged into Maine and\nthat's when you will see the the changes\nliveokay okay cool okay\num yeah so I think I think this should\nwork we'll see one way to find out\nand the the other thing is we will have\nto update our\nyeah we'll start by creating\num stuff okay so we'll create a static\nweb app\nwhen do you want to do that or am I okay\ntoo okay cool go aheadjust one just one\nwhat are you doing oh grafana cool yeah\nthat's gonna be a fun project oh that'd\nbe funexperience with grafana a little bit and\nit's it's I can see where the power lies\nin it are you gonna do it for uh learn\nto Cloud just to get like metrics and\nall that oh fun yeah and I had\nexperience but I was telling Gwen like I\nneed the the\nthose are Rusty now yeah because I used\nit like a year and a half or two years\nago so funny enough I had to go to this\narticle Gwen\nthat I wrote\nwow installing grafana and serving yes\nindones\nso take notes people yes the life you\nsave may be your own like right yeah I\nlove that and the first thing it\nmentions Gwen so this is the extent\nwhere our friendship goes I think\nnice it says hope everyone is doing\ngreat it's been a few months since I\npublished an article I was busy with\ngetting more YouTube videos out and did\nI mention I was on the Microsoft reactor\nsession with Gwen my goodness this was\nthis was like 2021 wow\nI feel like though I\npart of me was like oh that was in the\nfall but it was last\nyeah this is last last year oh my\ngoodness crazy oh the month crashed into\neach other\nwait I don't\nwe have the branchthe Implement cicd stuff the the yeah\nwhat branch am I because I right now I'm\npicking the organization repository and\nI have to pick the branch\nwhich branch am I using oh yeah you're\nright so let's start with creating a\nbranch\num it's going to learn to Cloud\ncreate\nah\na branch\nyou got it you could do it new Branch\num I didn't know how to create one in\nthe UI I just use yeah that's why I was\nso confused\num\nstating rightI think that is the right spelling so\ncreate branch\nokay yeah pick staging nowyeah the goo is confused everyone even\nyou know at the msps you know like where\nyou're still used to doing everything\nfrom like a command line yeah you know a\nlot of cloud tools for the networking\nyeah it's just so much am I straight\nforward yeah I was gonna say like they\ncould have added you know like ad Branch\nhere\num right yeah like it would have made\nsense but no so you have to click on six\nbranches click Ops click UPS wait or do\nwe do we use a build preset like react\nand yes react react okay yeah that just\nhelps a lot hold on let's switch to my\nstream because yeah yeah it'd be great\nto seeuh\npresent your screen share this one hereokayfree CS2\nGitHub and staging what's our app\nlocation yep root you can leave API\nblank and the folder is built awesome\nokay\nso this generates\na yaml file\noh look at how the heck am I supposed to\nwe can look at it after you oh there we\ngo zoomed in okay\nit should be the same pretty much except\nit's different branch here yep yeah that\nlooks cooldo we have\nAfricaalways tag your resources everyone\nthat's like a good tip always yep\nit's great I was like how many tags\nshould I create and then I was like okay\nlet's just name what this is like this\nis alone to Cloud so yeah I know one\nthing we do at work is we actually do\nthe uh git level or like the gitlab link\nor like have the link of like where if\nyou're having multiple projects it's so\ngood to be like where is the source\ncontrol here where's the git yeah you\nknow repository it's a great one too\nI found it the hardware because we used\nAWS and remember how that's your mistake\nwatch it watch it I mean technically\nwe're like two Azure to aw I mean\nRichard you're kind of all over the\nplace so you're not really like AWS all\nthe time oh no no I was saying about\npast right yeah majority of my work\nrelated stuff was AWS until like the\nlast year\num\nand yeah like if you didn't tag your\nresources they were so hard to find\nespecially like oh okay we have a VPC\ndoes it belong to this ec2 instance of\ncourse you can find it by looking at the\nUI and clicking things but\nforeign[Music]so if you go to learn to Cloud\nalthough they'll get repository like the\nGitHublet's show people that it automatically\nadded a git workflow for us\nso if we go here and then we go to\nstaging\nyeah\noh actually no we're supposed to go to\nGitHub go to actions yeah\nflows\nit's this one here but yeah we can go to\nactions as well\nand it would be we should probably name\nit something else yeah I'll change the\nname with my PR but it's this one here\nyep\nyou can open it up it'll show you the\nexact like steps that it's doing right\nnowyep\nbuild and play cool\nuh too cool so that's that's all I\nneeded to create right\nyes I wanted to fix your your thing here\nbut you can take the screen if you need\nto I'm gonna fix here\nbecause we don't need this anymoreoh my goodness how do I select here we\ngo okay\nso now we move this here let's see if I\ncan do a bit I can do a better Arrow\nthenso this ends up not being here doesn't\nthis end up beingthe where does this Arrow connect to\nbecause there's we still have cicd we\ndon't have previews anymore on me like\nthat's the goal\nprevious hereour goal is to get this here\nto connectto hereand then that goes to productionis this supposed to be a branch or an\narrow\nwhich one this this here\nthis is a branch\nso that's okay that's not bad I thought\nyou were trying to make an arrow\nso but I feel like it probably makes\nmore sense if we do this\nthis way and then can you flip no\nflip this oh my goodnessit was like uh\nlike this branch\na circle andpreviewpreviewbeautiful and then\nrectangle\nthey don't have shortcuts this thing\ndoesn't have shortcuts come on\nuh like thatall right cool so that goes there okay\nwe're kind of getting there with thisthis\noh my they don't connect either come on\nMicrosoft whiteboard I feel like this\nshould be better with this should be\nbetter whiteboarding functionality here\nthiswe love you Microsoft 514.this is constructive feedback\nhow to grab just this\nare they grouped no ohthis goes here and then\nbut I want to grab just thisokay you stay down here and then you\ncome hereokay here we go that's something all\nright\nPRSGitHubPride why is this here prod is over here\nstaging staging preview stage because\nthis kind of makes sense\nI'm very like\nlike a Perfection perfectionist when it\ncomes to diagrams so I'm sure I'm going\nto come into this later and just like\ngive it a makeover\nbut I would like to keep a track of\nthese for each session that we do so\npeople have an idea of\nlike visually cool so our staging just\ngot got deployed cooluh cool it just finishedicy Rock like that that is the name of\nour water\noh my gosh\nI see wrong yeah let me get we get to\nenjoy it's just the name of our oh my\ngosh it's just the name of our static\nweb apps like the random name yeah oh my\ngosh it's perfect\nso anyway here's our staging we can\npotentially uh oh I was thinking\nbut we would probably have to change\nalthough we might be able to have act\nremember it should be said we could have\nlike builds or PR or something that'd be\ncool that'd be cool but that I don't\nknow if that would requiresource code crop yeah that requires\nsource code changing to the footer to\ninclude whatever Branch it was merged to\nand then involve that into the action\nbecause only then it'll know that it\nhappened\nafter I was Maurice\nI'm starting my first job as a junior\ndevops on the 23rd seeing the dynamic of\neveryone working it's nice to see I'm\ngetting really good practice at nodding\nalong and acting like I know what's up I\nknow right[Music]\numso uh uh my Branch okay\nshould I switch Yeah Yeah\ncoolso what I'm doing is remember I removed\na bunch of chunk of code from here that\ndid the preview stuff for us in the main\nour produced\nPR previewsI'm gonna commit that\nthen push it to my branch\nwhat I also have to do is merge Gwen's\nstaging Branch now into my code so I can\nsee the both of the actions under\nworkflows\num and I believe I can do that by get\nmerge\nstagingnot something we can merge hmm\nlet's do a good poll wait what are you\ntrying to do\nyes\nand now let's do get merge region\nstitching so I'm merging staging Branch\ninto my uh\nfeature Branch because I want to see\nboth of the GitHub actionsthere we gookayso yeah this is our staging action and\nthen this is our\nprod\naction so we'll rename this one to what\ndo you want to call it proud cicdyes\nhmm\nprod in caps prod yeah\nokay\nsave that\nuh this is staging yeahsave thatrename using git like this with the UI\nis so confusing to me it is very weird\nso I always use like you know command\ncommands because I can't I always don't\nknow like am I supposed to hit the check\nabove am I supposed to hit this yeah\nyeah I've gotten used to it\nandbut there's a I don't know it's it's a\nweird habit whenever I pull stuff and\nlike merge stuff\nor you know whenever I'm pulling from\norigin I do it through CLI I don't know\nwhy hmm\num as you saw just in case just in case\nwhen you add to when you got to check\nwhat's two plus twos and you got to pull\nout the calculator calculator but it's\nso satisfying to see there's like greens\njust like you said when you do the pull\nyou're like oh it's like dopamine like a\ndopamine Rush\nyeah yeah I get it yeah\nrenamed the\nGitHub actionsworkflows hello my studying asks are\nthey using terraform no this isdo you guys find yaml easier to read\nthan Jsonuh yeah yeah\nI think\nit's because I see yaml more than Jason\nokay there was a time where I found\nlike Json better gotcha I feel like it's\nlike yeah for uh cloud formation at\nleast with AWS their IAC you can choose\nbetween yaml and Json and it's like all\nwe've always I've always chosen me I'm\nat my company I feel it's almost like a\npersonality test like if you choose Json\nlike I don't know like you're a\ndifferent kind of person than me that's\nfor sure did you choose that Json is not\nreally meant to be as much as people try\nto like say that it is it's not really\nmeant to be read by humans and like but\nlike the cameras reads better like yeah\nand comments and comments too that's\nlike the huge difference for me that\nlike helps out a ton it's like you can\ndocument the heck out of that you can't\ndocument Json it's like it's impossible\nno you can't well and that's why a lot\nof people like we have bicep which is an\nabstraction above arm which is our\ninfrastructure's code which is all Jason\nokay and everyone complains so much so\nthey made biceps a lot nicer to work\nwith than yeah but then it almost like\ngoes down to like I guess it compiles\ninto Json oh okay interesting but you\ndon't have to work with it because bicep\nalmost looks like terraform to me I\nthink yeah all right yeah it's really\nclose\nthe other day I was looking at it just\nto like get a feel for it it is really\nclose to like like it makes sense\nbecause I know terraform right\num whereas like cloud formation I\nremember it's so different oh yeah so\ndifferent\num\nokay so um what I'm doing right now is\nlearning about Branch protection rules\nbecause we want to protect our main\nbranch to be only be merged by staging\nand not every PR that you know our\ncommunity contributors create\nso it tells me to go to github.com\nnavigate to the main page of the\nRepository\nclick settings and then in the code and\nautomation section of the sidebar click\nbranches next to Branch protection rules\naddokay\nso what do I add into the rule\nyou can create a branch protection for\nspecific Branch all branches or any\nbranches that may imagine name pattern\nyou specify\nfor example to protect any branches\ncontaining the world release you can\ncreate a branch rule for Star release\nstar okay\nyou can create a rule for all current\nand future Brands branches in your\nupholstery with wild cardio\nbecause GitHub uses file colon colon\nI see\nso you can use foil cardswill match all the okay we don't need\nWhite cards if repository has multiple\nprotector branches that affect the same\nbranches the rules that include a\nspecific Branch name have the highest\npriority\nokaywhat is this for for Maine\nyeah I'm trying to figure out how you\ncan protect me so I'm guessing\nyou can figure it out in here so based\non the documentation you have to go into\nsettingsyou have to go into branchesthe default branch is considered a base\nbranch in your repository against yeah\nthat's our main\nand we don't have any branch protection\nrules Define a protector Branch rule to\ndisable Force pushing prevent branches\nfrom being deleted and optionally\nrequires sales status checks before\nmerging\nwe probably need those for both staging\nand Main yeah and I'm glad our main is\ndefault because I think that's why\nnobody can delete it but\ndid thatso I think I just type in main here\nyou don't need like a asterisk or\nanything like that that's for like if\nsomeone else names it main Dash\nsomething it'll also oh okay\nyeah so we don't need to have this like\nRejects this would reject everything and\njust use Main\nno I'm saying like the pattern matching\nis yeah yeah or just like wild cards and\nstuff well I think just wildcards it's\nnot exactly rejects yeah\num I think it said it hereWild Card syntax okay yeah yeah Okay\ncool so you can do like stars\num\nto include a pattern\nin the name\nokay how do you\nadd like staging in here or is it a rule\ndo you do this per Branch yeah I think\nyou do this per Branch you can have\nmultiple rules and then you can check\noff what you need\nyeah\num\nrequire a pull request before merging\nprobably yeah probablyI don't require assigned commits\nrequired in your history required\ndeployments to succeed before emerging\nbranches read-only users cannot push to\nbranch do not allow about bypassing the\nsettings restrict who can push to\nmatchinghmm\nso we require a pull request before\nmerging yes quiet approvals before\nmerging one yes\nuh this Misty still pull request\napprovals when new commits are Pew\npushed\nno reviewable commits push to a matching\nBranch will dismiss full request review\napproval rules\nuh I think we can leave that unchecked\nbecause I do that sometimes where\nlike I create a polar question then\nme and go and talk and we come up with\nanother idea and I'm like okay let me\ninclude it into this pulling twist and\nthen I commit new code\num\nrequire review from code owners yes\nrestrict who can dismiss pull request\nreviewsno restrict who can dismiss pull request\nreviews\nyeah we can leave that unchecked allow\nspecific actors to bypass required pull\nrequest no\nrequire approval of the most recent push\nyesum requires status checks to pass before\nmerging\nso this is where our testing will come\ninto play\num\nsince we don't have any\nskip for now okay yeah\num required conversation resolution\nbefore merging yeah\nrequires signed commitsbut then\nso remember what happened with day\nuh yeah I would say yeah because country\nis important\nrequire linear history prevent mortgage\ncommits from being pushed to matching\nbranchesdo you want linear history I think we'll\nrun into a problem\nbecause of I you know there could be\nmultiple PR's at a time yeah\n[Music]\nand this is another thing I would love\nto have is like our staging deployment\nto succeed\nbefore yeah yeah I don't see why that\nyeah that can happen\nbut can we add the deployment\nenvironments\nsee this is where you know Azure devops\nis like might be better yeah very well\nintegrated\nwith azure\nthe other thing I saw in the article\nGwen\nthis article here is they were able to\ndo this\nlike you know when you clicked\num GitHub here\nso they're staging previews are on the\nsame app so they don't need to\nhave different static web appswhich is nice\nbut there might be a way to do it\nthere might be\num the the community question someone\nasked in the forums\num they said the PM is looking into this\nas a feature but the last comment was in\n2022 like early 2022 oh\nhelpfulthe issue\nand it's like this hasn't been updated\nfor like three years you're like a bunch\nof comments oh I'm I'm doing the same\nthing okay like can you let me know when\nthis gets included into the features uh\nthat's when you know you're treading new\nground you're like okay I guess I'm the\none to answer it\nlock branch is read only no okay do not\nallow bypassing the above settingsyeah because these are settings we're\nsupposed to respect as well\nrestrict who restrict who can push to\nmatching branches no\nwe won't have one main uh\nthe rules applied to everyone including\nadministrators\nyesare we ready\n[Music]\ndo we dareyeah we can come in and like change this\nhopefully yeahimagine we lock ourselves out and now we\nhave to follow thisthat would be wildmulti-factor see this shows me that it's\nserious we're gonna get locked outI'm looking to create my cloud resume\nchallenge I failed my cka exam it's okay\nif I consider if I publish what I\nconsidered why I failed and recommend\npeople some tips I learned or should I\nonly publish My Success activities\nsuccessful activities I'm assuming what\ndo people think about this\nyes publish that\nI would say\ndefinitely I have a video of like why no\nI failed my Linux certification\nsomething like that it's like one of my\nmost popular ones highly recommend it\nit's especially if you have figured out\nwhy you don't do well I think that could\nbe pretty helpful yeah\nuh I would just say be careful and not\nbe like\nI failed this it's so hard I'm never\ngonna figure it out don't be like that\nyou know no that's not useful for anyone\num but yeah if you can be honest and\nprovide some some advice there I would\nsay yeahwhere are we at Richard\nuh I was looking at the environments you\ncan add environments but I'm just not\nsure if it's only\nGitHub Pages GitHub yeahNADA pong says Good Vibes how you doing\nhi from India hi good morning\nwhat time is it in India It's gotta be\nlike\nwell like early morning\nfresh up I feel like you would know\nwhat time it is in India\nit's pretty late\nsomeone said good morning I'm from India\nyeah or early I guess 6 51 a.m I guess\nfor sure wouldn't knowI'm not sure if this what does this do\nyou can configure environments with\nprotection rules variables and secrets\nmaybe if you need secrets for different\nenvironments\nI see yeah yeah yeah yeah but it is only\nI guess true for like GitHub Pages then\nbecause I don't see any way to configure\nstatic web apps as an environment here\nlet's eat that out\nokay so going back to branches where are\nwe at right now so we have staging we\nhave to ICD for staging it pushes to the\ndev\nyeah web app now we need to connect that\nthat to go to main\nyeah that's what we are waiting on now\nokay we already locked the main\nnow we have to figure out how we merge\nlike okay\nso we have to find a way that whenever a\nPR gets created\nit gets created for staging\nokay\ndoes it make sense\nbecause right now if I open a PR it will\nget created for main\nI think but because of the rules it will\nsay Hey you cannot create a pull request\nfor me\nuh how do we change the the switch where\nGitHub detects that okay the the PRS\nshould be created for staging\nand then we\nmerge staging into main hmm is that that\ncould be like on a repo uh options I\nwould feel like on a like a\nsetting okay default oh it says it right\nhere hey\nhey the default branch is considered the\nbase branch in a repository against\nwhich all pull requests and code commits\nare automatically made unless you\nspecify a different branch we were about\nto like try to figure this out no we're\nfollowing rishab's advice to read read\neverything yes\nread it\nokay I'm gonna switch this okay now\nokay so we're sure what that means when\nwe say default branch\nyes okay excellent I think so because\nthere's no\nlike you know\nsmall star or extra six let's read more\nhere you're in the danger zone right\nhereI gotcha all rightthere it is I told youoh okay I see this yeah yeah yeah\nthey're saying we have open pull\nrequests that can be impacted we'll have\nconsequences because we have open pull\nrequests you have another one right now\nyeah can you merge that please\nokay\nand then we can close the other one\nbecause that one\nI don't think we received a response\nfrom the contributor for a while now\ndon't you love warning messages like oh\nchill I know are you sure are you really\nsure are you really sure like these\npeople are doing something serious\nI'm gonna make sure you know the right\nmindsetumNepali translations these were to the\ncontributors\nand contributing\nso Gwen checked in four days ago I\nchecked in last year in Octoberwhen am I okay to close this yeah go\nahead just leave a comment like Hey\nwe're closing this closing for yeah due\nto\ninactivityokay all right\nI wish to editing uh configuration files\nin Linux work like that like when before\nthey ask you oh do you want to say after\nyou say like are you sure you want to\nsave this\nall right you change this interface you\ngot a lot you're going to get locked out\nof your box okay yeahI can't merge rishab oh no\nyep because we changed the rules we\nlocked you out it says merging is\nblocked the base Branch requires all\ncommits to be signed wait this could be\na good test does she have to merge to\nstaging and then emerged Iknow it's weird I meanthat's weird I'm looking at what\nsignature verification basically means\noh that's good\num you can sign commits and tags locally\nto give other people confidence about\nthe original chance you have made if\ncommit or tag has gpg\nSSH\nsignature that is cryptographically\nverifiable GitHub box the commit or tag\nverified or partially verified for most\nindividual users gpg or SSH will be the\nbest choice for signing commits\nSSS signatures are the simplest to\ngenerate you can even upload your\nexisting authentication key to GitHub\nokay now I remember why my commit is not\nsigned because my SS SSH key expired\non December 31st 2012. so what were youand then as like rishabh Kumar seven\nlike with my get user but I don't have\nlike like it uses HTTP authentication\nrather than uh\num like SSH key yeah yeahso what would you have to do you'd have\nto generate you have to do one set it up\nand then commit againyeah that would be the\nideal way or I bypass\nit now for this commit get this merged\nyeah\nand then\nI think we would have to add a Wiki too\nthen Gwen because I feel like most of\nthe users are signed in as like SSH I\nknow over the https yeah over the httpe\num and they will be like\nwhy can't I merge\nbut only if we don't turn it for staging\nlike we could leave it remain off for\nstaging yeah yeah yeah\nall right let's turn it off for now and\nthen we'll\nenable it later for Main\noh\nsettings\nI'm like why this tab looks differentimagine if it doesn't let me do that\nyeah that'd be Hilary\nwe'll see uhsigned there you gonow is the moment of shootah okay so let me refresh okay now I can\nmergeawesome cool okay\nso now we are good to update our default\nBranch to staging now the real Moment of\nTruthchanging your default Branch can have\nunintended consequences that can affect\nnew pull requests and clones\nso I guess our Forks are impacted by\nthis which is fine because we have\nchanged the architecture too much\nalreadyokaywe are live I guess so now\nstaging is a default branchyepstaging is default\nand this is the one that'll keep like\nmost up to date now we just have to keep\nin mind that we have to merge\nit to main every now and then\nor like as we approve pull requests that\nwould yeah that should be the thing\nright away we're emerging manually\nyes\nremember the approval thing yeah so but\nwhat does that workflow look like it's\nwe get the pr it emerges and then\nyeah we'll have to\nright now what we have to do is\ngo into Main\nit'll say you know implement or let's\nsay\nyou know Nicholas PlayStation PR right\nnow oh you like sync\nyeah it'll say do you want to like sync\nstaging to main because it'll say like\nyou're behind two commands yeah you're\nbehind these many commits of staging\nwould you like to\nmerge it to Main and then that\nsort of updating it that's pushes to to\nprod to prod\nokay yeah so right now if Nicholas opens\nuh pull request\nit will be merged to staging like we'll\nsee this the pull request here to be\nthe request will be for merging it to\nstaging\nfrom staging to main is like our\nresponsibility of people who we choose\ngot it\ncool so we accomplished this taskum yes testing was not part of it so I\nwon't say we didn't accomplish thisconsidering the future future features\nyes testing will be part of this we'll\nhave to add some issues for testing like\nbut we also need to figure out what kind\nof tests we want to yeah that's a good\nquestion yeahyeah all right cool well we've been\nstreaming for like an hour and a half so\nit's time to\nget off thisum let me switch to\nyeah the four there's four of us here oh\nno no no hold on that makes me look like\n[Laughter]well what did everyone learn it's pop\nquiz time oh CJ how do what does it mean\nwhen a commit is not signedI'm just kiddingum yeah oh yeah yeah it was cool not in\nthumbs up right not in a wave yeah if we\nfigured it out\num\nthe worship how did you feel about\nworking on\non stream um\nit was good I think\nI felt like the only thing I was\nconcerned about is I've never done this\nlike I've done this with you Gwen but\nthat is more like casual you know\nwe speaking\nstuff\num because we are not on stream right\nand like there was a sense of you know\nearlier\nthat\nyou know just the Imposter syndrome\nkicking it\num\nand I to be honest I thought it would be\neasier\nthan this like the technical aspect of\nthis I thought it should be easier to\njust have staging environments because\nit's a built-in feature in static web\napps and we should be able to achieve it\nwithin one app with one GitHub action\nbut that was not the case so from that\npoint like that aspect it was\nchallenging but that was fun\num and from the other aspect I had a\nfeeling that if this would be\nuncomfortable\num at certain extent but it was fun\nit helps you have other people who can\nlike entertain because when the issue\nwith live streaming is you know you do\nhave a chat that you\nyou kind of have to keep up with or\nentertain to an extent so this is why\nI've always not I can't understand how\npeople who just do like code and a live\nstream can like accomplish focused work\nbecause you kind of help us have the\nback of your mind like oh there's an\naudience so that's why I thought having\nother people would kind of make it\neasier for whoever it is actually doing\nthe work to focus\nbut I very much like this is like a\nvirtual co-working kind of thing\nyeah yeah this was cool for sure\num for hanging out yeah yeah\nand\nI don't know that's it we plan on doing\nthis maybe\nI would like to commit to like every\nSunday uh I'm not saying you guys have\nto be here every single Sunday but I\nworship and I will\nuh and then having people hop on as\nneeded like but we could find tasks like\nthat sort of played to the strengths of\nother people like we could find some\nPowershell stuff to do yeah we don't\nhave any AWS stuff to do but we could do\nsomething fun stuff no but this would be\ngreat experience to like learn like it's\nlike sometimes you're gonna be learning\ntechnology set like you never touched\nlike it's part of your job so like\nthat'd be perfect I'd be like hey let me\nlearn GitHub actions I don't really know\nit that well let's like do that live you\nknow like yeah just like you were doing\nrishab I mean this is almost like an\nexample of what you'll get a ticket in\nyour role and be like I've never done\nthis before but exactly I'm gonna try it\nanyway and then like you go through the\nprocess and then you do it and like\nthat's how you learn stuff or that's how\nyou know stuff it's just through to\nhaving that like I don't know and then\nlike I kind of know a little more than I\ndid now so yeah definitely and yeah how\ndid you feel\nI mean I didn't do much so I feel great\nI just feel like emceeing so it's like\nit makes it it removes the pressure for\nme to like\nTechnical and\nyeah but I enjoy hanging out with other\npeople it's like a really loud\nmotorcycle aside\nit's gone\num\nyeah I enjoy I've been wanting to do\nmore stuff with other people so this is\na great opportunity to do so\nso I appreciate you both worship as\nalways appreciate you\nwe should be here next week at some\npoint turn notification on and whatnot\nand if you have any interest in doing\nany work and kind of like be on stream\nand working through something with us\njust comment on one of the issues in our\nour GitHub project\nand we can help you accomplish that\nand that's it\nI'll see everyone at some point\npeace out thanks everyone",
