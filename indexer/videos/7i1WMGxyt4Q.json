  "title": "How to become a Cloud Engineer",
  "transcript": "hi everyone today I'm going to be\ntalking about three areas I believe you\nshould be focusing your learning on if\nyou want to become a cloud engineer in\n2020 I'll try my best to keep it short\nand sweet but also provide an overview\nand some tools and some resources and\nperhaps some project ideas for each areayou build monitor administrate architect\ncloud solutions and infrastructure and\ndepending on where you work if you work\nat a larger company you might be\ninvolved in just one of these tasks if\nyou work at a smaller company like me\nyou may have your hands in every bit of\nthese tasks and it can be overwhelming\nbut it's also very exciting so you know\nstick with it\nyou're going to live in breathe in one\nor multiple clock platforms at your job\nso learning one well is the key here\nin 2020 you can't go wrong with her\nlearning AWS or GCP AWS does have more\njobs I think that's just because they\nhave been around for longer and they\ncurrently hold the majority of market\nshare though Adger is catching up pretty\nfast and gzp isn't as popular but it's\nit's still a very very interesting\noption and I would totally say if you're\ninterested in learning you know Google\ncloud you know go for it the key really\nis to just learn one well a lot of the\npractices that you learn in one will\ntranslate over to all of them it\nbasically just comes down to you know\nthings are named differently in\ndifferent cloud platforms so yeah pick\none learn one will I think\ncertifications are great great ways to\nget a wide range of high level knowledge\non multiple services inside of you know\nthe cloud platform that you choose I\nknow a lot of people don't like\ncertifications but I think if you're\njust getting started they are amazing I\nknow they helped me a lot and they still\ndo help me even though I've been in the\nfield for a couple of years now of\ncourse they won't replace getting\nhands-on sign up for a cloud platform\nyou'll get some free credits and as you\ngo through tutorials as you're watching\na video as you're reading some sort of\nblog posts or book implement the theory\nimplement the exercises just make sure\nto delete the resources after you're\ndone using your dumb learning I would\nrecommend Linux Academy they're not\npaying me or sponsoring this video or\nanything like that but I used them when\nI was getting AWS certified like three\nfour years ago and what helps me a lot\nwas they have live labs and sandbox\nenvironments built into the course so\nit's a couple of videos and then you get\na set of instructions in a sandbox\nenvironment to implement what you've\nlearned and then you keep going in and\nyou have a mix of theory and hands-on\nwork that you get done and it's really a\ngreat way to learn\nI'm going to break this down into two\nparts part one learn the theory and why\nDevOps is important part to learn the\nskills and the tools that implement the\nskills\nit's a set of practices that if you\nimplement you will shorten your\ndevelopment lifecycle improve your\nsoftware quality and provide continuous\ndelivery of your software and all of\nthis of course means you better serve\nyour customers and your time to market\nis shorter which would make you more\ncompetitive which is always a good thing\njust because you can release quickerfor this I recommend two books the book\ncalled the Phoenix project which is a\nstory it's about an IT manager who's who\ninherits this mission critical business\ncritical project that is severely\nover-budget and severely behind schedule\nthe CEO one day comes in and it's like\nif you don't fix everything within 90\ndays I'm going to outsource the entire\ndepartment and this is like thousands of\npeople so obviously thousands of people\nwill be losing their jobs funny story\nhere I was actually reading that book I\njust finished that book before I went\nfor my interview for the jr. rule my\njunior cloud engineering role just a\ncouple years back and I had finished my\ninterview with the person who's like my\ndirect supervisor now and we were\nwaiting for the CEO to come in and the\nsupervisor asked me just to kill time\nlike hey what are you currently reading\nand I told them the Phoenix project and\nhe was like no way I'm currently reading\nthat too and then we sort of established\na bond there over the story and I asked\nhim as I was working on the script of\nthis video like hey was that moment we\nhad over talking about the Phoenix\nproject that influence that all of the\nfact that I got hired and he mentioned\nthat he believes yes because it showed\nthat I had you know actually natural\npassion for learning about these things\nso I don't know if that story helps you\nat all but I'm you know a healthy kid I\nthe second book is the DevOps handbook\nwhere the Phoenix project tells you the\nstory of implementing DevOps practices\nthe DevOps handbook is the handbook of\ndoing like the instructions manual it\ngives you the theory and the technical\nsteps to follow those two kind of go\nhand-in-handinside of DevOps you have automated\ntesting continuous integration and\ncontinuous deployment monitoring and\ninfrastructure s code which what I would\nsay are the most important skills to\nknow you must swap your tools for each\none typically you'll see CI CD\ncontinuous integration continuous\ndeployment and automated testing as one\ntool or one service and you know github\nactions at your DevOps circle CI are the\nones that come to mind so google those\nsee which one you like the most and as a\nproject to pull your own website using\nCI NCD for infrastructure s code docker\nis pretty much the standard for working\nwith containers kubernetes is pretty\nmuch the standard for container\norchestration so organizing your doctor\ncontainers and then you have terraform\nwhich i believe is probably the industry\nstandard for for provisioning\ninfrastructure but there are the things\nlike ansible I believe Jenkins as well\nbut terraform is what I use so I'm a\nlittle biased and monitoring graph wanna\ncomes to mind date a dog new relic\nPrometheus I problem Prometheus probably\nmight be your best bet but like I said\nGoogle the skill and then see what tools\ncome up and you know pick which one you\nwant to learn and another project could\nbe deploy some infrastructure with\nterraform and that will give you some\ninfrastructure as code experiencereally the cost saving and the time\nsaving and the magic and benefit of\nusing the cloud it comes when you can\nautomate your tasks and you will have to\ndo that through code recommending the\nbest code programming language to to\nlearn is hard honesty you have to pick\none and learn it well in the concepts\nwell that way you can like every other\narea you know learning one and then you\ncan translate your skills it's the same\nthing with programming like when I was\nstarting with AWS I picked up Python and\nshell scripting and when I got hired for\nmy junior role they were an azure shop\nthey aren't at her shop so I picked up\nPowerShell in c-sharp and that's\ncurrently what I use on my day to day\nit's really about understanding the\nconcepts and then picking the right\ntools for it if you're still having a\nhard time picking language you really\ncan't go wrong with Python as a side\nnote I will say learn to use the\nterminal learn to move around\ncomfortably in the terminal earn some of\nthe popular commands some of the\nnetworking things it will save you a lot\na lot of time so some resources here for\nPython there's this book called Python\ncrash course I think it's by Eric\nMatthews and there's a youtube series\ncalled Python 2020 by Derek Banias very\ngood resources for Python as far as\nusing the terminal and shell scripting I\nwould say Joe Collins Joe Collins has a\nfantastic series on it so just go I'm\njust look it up on YouTube you'll find\nit\nyou don't have to be a masher at one\nspecific tool the most important part of\nbeing a cloud engineer is understanding\nwhy you would have to use something and\nwhen is something the best to use tools\ncome and go but the practices and the\nskills are always there they evolve but\nthey're always there so don't worry too\nmuch about being like the kubernetes\nexpert or the docker expert or the\nterraform expert don't about that that\ncomes with as you evolve in your career\nand you know there's plenty of things\nthat I still have no idea about Here I\nam making a living doing this cloud is\nvery overwhelming there's a lot of\npotential a lot of movement going on\nhere it's a little bit of work a little\nbit of focus you you you can land that\njob so good luck to you and I will see\nyou in the next video",
