  "transcript": "hey everyone welcome to a new video i've\nbeen wanting to start this\nseries where i grab a question that i\nget asked often\nand i spend you know three four minutes\njust talking and providing my insight\nagain this is based off my experience\nand my\nyou know i guess insight with working\ninside of cloud and such like that\nso this isn't like you know the final\nanswer but just you know more insight\nright\nnow the question i get asked the most\nis which programming language should i\nlearn and\nhow much code do i need to actually know\nin order to work in cloud in order to\nland a role\nnow like most things in tech\nthere isn't one perfect answer but what\ni will say\nis which platform are you learning are\nyou learning are you learning aws\nare you learning azure you're learning\ngcp you know first\nsettle on that once you know that go and\ndo some searching and see\nwhich language has the most examples\nand go with that one in my case when i\nstarted working in azure like two years\nago\ni really really wanted to learn python\nbecause i thought it was just like\nthe coolest language and i wanted to\nbecome really really good at it\nbut i found more examples of the stuff\nthat i was trying to do\nin azure in dot-net and c-sharp\nit had the most examples that's like the\neasiest way i can answer the question\nso maybe for aws it's python maybe for\ngcp it's go and for azure it's dotnet\nlike whichever one it is\npick that one and move forward with that\none the reality is if that\nyou work enough with one language and\nyou understand the fundamentals\nthat will translate over into you know\nlearning a different language picking up\na different skill or\nyou know then later on you're like hey i\nreally actually like\nthis like programming stuff let me dive\ndeeper into like learning it and then\nyou can start building stuff like\nyou know websites and apps if you want\nto right but you don't need to have that\nfull skill set to work in cloud your\nyour\nyour the importance i guess and your\nlearning should be focused on\nunderstanding how to like\ndeploy um infrastructure and deploy\nsolutions\nand and how to work effectively and\nefficiently inside of the platform\nwith a language versus actually\ndeveloping these solutions\nlater on you may find yourself in a\nsituation like where i'm at now\nwhere certain opportunities are\npresenting themselves where if i was\nbetter at like\nprogramming.net i'd be able to take\nadvantage of them and that's why you see\nme like studying.net and learning and\nlike\nlike on the stuff that i've been doing\non twitch and like the streams and such\num but that isn't the case for when i\nwas like it wasn't the case when i was\nbeginning like\njust knowing enough to automate things\nwas more than enough right\nuh but programming is definitely at\nleast scripting\nit's definitely a skill in automating\nthings it's definitely a skill that's\ngoing to just\ntake you like just like set you on a\ncorrect path in terms of cloud\ndon't necessarily worry about becoming\nthe best you know software developer\nanything like that\njust know how to automate things um yeah\nand that's what i would say in terms of\nthis question if you have any questions\nyou'd like me to take\nthree to four minutes answering uh leave\nthem in the comments\nif you already know how to program or\nyou know if you're learning a language\ncan you let me know can you let me know\nwhich language you're learning or which\nlanguage you know\nand which platform do you primarily work\ninside because i would love to know that\ntoo\nif you want to learn.net alongside me uh\njoin me on my twitch streams\ni have one today 6 p.m eastern\nif not i will see you in the next video\nthank you for watching",
