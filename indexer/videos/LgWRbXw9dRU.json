  "transcript": "foreign[Music][Music]thank youhello everyone and welcome thank you all\nfor joining us today for this live\nstream event my name is Albina and I'm\nthe program manager of the Microsoft\nreactor San Francisco I will be sharing\nsession Resources with you in the chat\nbut before we begin I would like to\nquickly review two items with you our\ncode of contact and our event guidelines\nfirst please take a moment to review our\ncode of conduct Microsoft reactor seeks\nto provide a respectful environment for\nboth our audience and our presenters we\ndo encourage engagement in the chat but\nplease be mindful of your commentary\nremain professional and on topic\nand secondly our event guidelines this\nsession is being recorded and will be\navailable on demand through the\nMicrosoft reactor YouTube channel in\nabout 24 to 48 hours I'll be sharing the\nlink in the chat for our YouTube channel\nand if you have not been on a live\nstream through YouTube before please\nknow that you must create an account on\nYouTube in order to access and interact\nin the chat you can set that up right\nnow and if you're unable to use a chat\nbut have questions feel free to reach\nout to us through the social media or\nMeetupwhich brings us to today's session Linux\non Azure what is it how and when to use\nit this session will run approximately\nfor 60 minutes and I'm going to bring in\nour speaker Gwen\nand our guest reshap as well welcome\nthank you so much Albina as always for\nthe wonderful introduction hi everyone I\nsee a couple people in the chat hanging\nout with us already awesome let us know\nwhere you are checking in uh also do let\nme know if you are on our our session\nlast week where we talked all about how\nLinux works and today we're going to\ntake it a step further and talk a little\nbit about more about utilizing Linux on\nAzure and I have my friend rishab here\nhe he wasn't on the\nlet's switch to this so he wasn't on the\num\nlike the series information or the page\nor when you register you probably didn't\nsee his name because last minute I was\nlike I really want to talk about uh an\napp that we have in production that is\nutilizing Linux and it's on Azure and\nit's an effort by both of us it's called\nlearn a cloud some of you may or may not\nhave heard of it so no one better than\ntalk about these things with than\nhimself so hey Richard how you doing\nI'm doing good I'm doing good and I\nguess most of the people no one says is\nthe duo right the cloud Duo so we do a\nlot together yeah yeah\num yeah we are back\num and I think this is my first reactor\nstream for this year\noh wow I'm I'm honored yeah you do uh no\nyou take out with the reactor too as\nwell rishab does a whole bunch of other\nstuff now with me\num but yeah for today uh I want to dive\na little bit more onto Linux on Azure\nwe're going to talk a little bit more\nabout Open Source and then the history\nof Open Source at Microsoft which was\npretty interesting to read about\num but we're gonna keep these things at\nhigh level then we're gonna talk a\nlittle bit more about utilizing Linux on\nAzure then we're gonna demo a little bit\nabout uh again showcasing our use of\nLinux on Azure and then also I want to\nactually I'm gonna do this right now\nbecause this might take a while so are\nyou all familiar with the Azure\ndeveloper CLI Azure developer seal I\ndon't know if anyone's used it before\num also I just got access to the the\nBing chat thing with uh open AI nice so\nfreaking cool anyway\num so the Azure developer CLI is it's a\nCLI that will enable you to essentially\ndeploy full-on\nproduction ready applications to Azure\nwith a simple command and they have a\nbunch of templates I asked um Savannah\nwho is the PM for the Azure developer\nCLI because I know a lot of their\ntemplates are I want to open up one of\nthese templates a lot of their templates\nare based off of like Linux images so if\nwe look on like sushi sharp I know the\nthese app service ones are based off\nLinux images and I know the one for the\nc-sharp and Azure functions is also\nbecause I helped author that one but\nthey also have like Java and OJ node.js\nPython and I want to pick I don't know\nlet's pick this Java one as an example\nit's off based off container apps and I\nasked her like well so what was the\nreasoning or can you give me like a\nstatement because I want to share with\nthe the people watching the streams like\nwhat was the reasoning behind\n[Music]\num\nyou know basing these templates off all\nlike Linux images and then Savannah's\ngreat she's one of the funniest and\ncoolest people to talk but she basically\nwas like honestly Linux is where the\npeople is at so that's super\nstraightforward I was like I'm gonna use\nthat exactly because it was it's just\nthe truth it's like you know we'll see a\ncouple more stats about uh why like\nthat's sort of like back up the\nstatement at first but I'm gonna do this\ndeployment first because it's probably\ngonna take a while\num oh look at this WSL which is Linux on\non Windowsand then we're gonna make deer we're\ngonna call this Howlin next Works demo\nand then we're gonna CD into this lovely\ndirectory name yeah love it uh and then\nwe'll just do azd up\nand we're gonna call this\nwhich is called reactor demo\ncool it's also way too big and the\nreason I'm running this now is because\nit might take a few moments and yeah I\ndon't want us to wait towards the end\nbecause we might have a lot too oh my\ngoodness oh docker's not running if I\nrun Docker will it\nwill it give me issues because because\nthis is using uh container app so\nobviously the docker technology needs to\nbe running\ngive me a second I will get this running\nand then we'll run this command again\nand as long as it's running in the\nbackground we should totally be fine I\ndo want to add while we're waiting\nyou think Linux you got to think Bash\nif you're not familiar with bash lucky\nfor you today we released bash for\nbeginners uh we can drop the link into\nthe chat for you all but it is 20 20\nvideos uh I think the longest one might\nbe 11 but the majority of them are\nanywhere from like five to six minutes\nlong it covers all your fundamentals for\nlearning bash utilizing bash in the\ncontext of like scripting for clis and\nthings like that I think this is running\nnow okay and it's free it's on YouTube I\nhelped author that as well so be sure to\ncheck that out\nand we're going to hit yes here and I\nthink this is going to provision okay\ncool all right back to the content here\nso anyway open source uh switch over\nhere\nswitch this way actually\nuh I think it's this one hereokay there's someone in the chat who\nsaid I was just going through the bash\ncourse before this stream started\nperfect timing I got people multitasking\nyeah yeah oh I wanted to okay just to\nback up that point that I was saying and\nI shared this on on Twitter earlier\ntoday but\nso you know when we think of Linux uh\nand we think of cloud so cloud has done\nlike this amazing job of abstracting\nlike networking programming\num Hardware secure oh maybe yeah\nsecurity to an extent and then you know\nthe cloud is is nothing more than a\nbunch of beautiful Linux service network\ntogether right but that doesn't mean\nthat\nyou need to know uh how Linux works like\nfor example all the stuff that we\ncovered in the session last time kernel\nuser space uh the the the file system\nhow things boot like you don't it's\nthose things are interesting to know for\nsure\num if you're a nerd and you like to know\nlike what's under the engine and whatnot\nbut it's absolutely not necessary when\nyou're trying to like work in the cloud\nright but the cool thing is like\nrealizing like okay so this is the chart\nthat I kind of quickly made today is\nlike well it's we have the services on\nthis uh our y-axis and then the level of\nLinux extraction on the x-axis so uh\nwhen we think about like knowing the\nabsolute most about Linux which would be\nlike the lower level uh bash is\ndefinitely useful there but you go like\na level up and you're working with like\nvirtual machines and Bash is useful\nthere too you go level higher you're\nthinking like Azure kubernetes Service\nuh or you know something like that where\nit's like a managed service but you\nstill get access you can get access to\nlike the underlying yes infrastructure\nif you needed to like mess with the apis\nor whatnot bash is useful there too uh\nbut then if you go like a level up\nhigher I put like container apps here\nyeah coincidentally I'm using that for\nthe demo as well but if you do like\nfunctions or and then you can swap these\nout for whatever their equivalents are\nin any Cloud it doesn't really matter I\njust know the Azure one so I put them\nthere like\nCLI skill set bash Powershell skill set\nhere and like no matter what like no\nmatter what service you throw at what\nlevel of instruction you throw it at\nit's going to be very useful so\nhopefully people find that uh something\nto add I think you can probably get\nthrough the whole thing just watching it\nuh in like two hours or so and then\nobviously it's going to take you some\ntime to get Hands-On and whatnot but I\nthink you could spend like a weekend and\nget uh pretty comfortable there as well\nso keep that in mind okay cool back to\nwhat I was actually supposed to talk\nabout today\nso what is open source a very brief uh I\nguess one-liner on the topic is\nSo Soft it's primarily a like a\nsimulated with like software but I know\nthere are other products that um like\nlike literature and things like that\nthat are also associated with open\nsource but primarily when we speak about\nopen source we're talking about software\ncode projects related to code and things\nlike that\nwhere the source code\nso if you think of like an application\nwhatever makes up the application\nbecause ultimately like the program\neverything comes down to code uh is made\navailable for anyone to use modify and\nshare freely so that's pretty much just\nlike the the most vagueyeah and then some some examples so for\nexample uh vs code Docker kubernetes SQL\nServer we I put learn to Cloud there\nfree code Camp is an example of because\nthey they open source or other\ncurriculum so that is an example of not\nnecessarily being software but it is\ntied to something like that so they also\nopen source I think they might be one of\nthe largest GitHub repos also like in\nterms of popularity which is pretty cool\nyeah\num but yeah so you say that it it can't\nbe it just doesn't have to be software\nit can be you know educational content\nit can be you know your notes and like\ntools that you build\num exactly so everything can be part of\nthis ecosystem uh that we know as of\nOpen Source cool absolutely we have a\ncouple comments here that I wanted to\naddress the same can be said for\nPowershell plus a bunch more I would\nagree yeah that's why I was trying to\nsay like CLI in general term like a CLI\nskill set in general Powershell is built\nnot built into Linux so not recommended\nso this is like this is where like the\nbonus Point goes to bash where it's like\nessentially a universal language like a\nlot a lot of Linux distros cover Bash\nfrom like scratch you don't have to\ninstall it like I mean even python\nsometimes comes but it's not like no I\nthink so yeah yeah like bash is like\nyou'll know you can go in there and use\nit without having like any in additional\ndependencies\num but both are great right\num\nso cool we were talking about okay some\nmore open so yeah we're going through\nsome examples here uh more open source\nfacts and also I would just like to say\nthis isn't a Powershell versus bash like\none is better you shouldn't learn the\nother one if you know anything about\nlike my background as someone who\ndelivers technical content is I truly\ndon't care what people select I really\njust want you to learn whatever it is is\nthat is going to enable you to land a\njob or upskill and that oftentimes is\nsort of reverse engineering like a job\ndescription or whatever it is I just\ntend to like to cover things around the\nstuff that I like so bash uh Azure and\nwhatever but ultimately if you decide to\ngo learn Powershell and AWS which would\nbe an interesting combination more power\nto you I don't I don't really enjoy\nthese like AWS version Azure like these\ncom like the conversations yeah the\ndebates of conversations that tend to go\nviral and enter that's not where\num I like to dedicate my time but anyway\nOkay cool so that's kind of like sort of\nhigh level of talking about like open\nsource uh can be used for commercial not\ncommercial non-commercial purposes often\ndistributed for free but it's not always\nlike it could be open source but have\nsome sort of cost Associated to it maybe\nit's not directly through like paying\nfor access to it or something like that\nbut it's often Associated free with open\nsource whether that is good or not\nis a totally different type of question\num but\nthat's just the way that it is right\nyeah and I think that's where you know\nwe would have to like dive really deep\ninto like licensing and stuff there are\ndifferent kind of Open Source licenses\nlike where you can\nnot for the repo and customize it in to\nsome way where you make it profitable\nbut yeah yeah I I hope the audience get\nthe point that you know it can be free\nbut there might be some gray area with\ncertain softwares yeah and also just\nbecause something is free not as again\nthe licensing detail really does matter\nbecause it's not like oh just because\nit's free I can reutilize it for\nabsolutely anything no but that would\nrequire a whole different type of talk\nwhere you just you can write a book on\ndifferent languages yeah uh so typically\nthis is also not important these last\ntwo are very important too typically\ndeveloped and maintained by a community\nor individual sometimes it's just\nthere's that funny meme where it's like\na bunch of I don't remember what it is\nbut a bunch of things stacked or it's\nlike these massive corporations and at\nthe bottom it's like one tiny brick\nthat's holding absolutely everything up\nand it's like one little one Library\nthat's maintained by a single person\nyeah yeah have you seen that I think I\nsaw it earlier I've seen it or something\nlike that and it's like yeah the reality\nis a lot of like\npackages or applications libraries\nthings like that that are used in like a\nlot of like web are often open source\nand maintained by a small amount of\npeople or a single person but there is a\nbigger push I've noticed to get\num support from companies or\norganizations that do utilize open\nsource to you know continue backing\nthese uh these projects you know GitHub\nsponsors and things like that it does\nneed to be significantly more for sure\nyes uh but it's getting better\nso those are some interesting uh open\nsource facts there uh let's talk more\nabout Open Source at Microsoft which was\nquite an interesting\nthing to read about now just for context\nI joined to Microsoft about a year and a\nhalf ago so I'm way into like the Satya\nNadella phase way into like Microsoft\nembracing Linux Microsoft embracing open\nsource but I know it hasn't always been\naround here I have like the privilege to\nbe around a lot of people who have had\nlike 15 20 years of of being at\nMicrosoft and then they they like will\ntell me first time from first-hand\nexperience like it used to not be like\nthis like the culture was completely\ndifferent now we're in at Microsoft\nwe're definitely at a place where it's\nlike open first and then there needs to\nbe a discussion whereas if something\nneeds to be closed or not open source\ninstead it used to be like close first\nwe'll see we'll see we'll consider open\nsource later on right so I'd curious\njust to know about other people's\nexperience with Microsoft Technologies\nor with Microsoft in general like what\nwhat era did you start using Microsoft\nor know about Microsoft Technologies and\nhave you seen this shift as well\num so let me let me know about that\nright so anyway Beginnings I like to\nclassify this as the wrong side of\nHistory and I have like two phrases here\nthat kind of stick out that I wanted to\nshare these are quotes this is not\nsomething I'm saying do not cut this off\nyeah\nso Linux is a cancer that attaches\nitself in an intellectual property sense\nto everything it touches so this was by\na next CEO of Microsoft Steve Ballmer uh\nand this article is called the well\ntalking about like Linux is a Cancer and\nthis was like early 2000s I believe or\nmid-2000s around that time\num if you Google I mean if you Bing if\nyou search this with chat gbt you'll\nprobably get a lot more information\naround a lot a lot of Articles this was\ncovered extensively pretty interesting\nright\num another thing that I saw in this uh\nthis talk that's called it's like an MIT\ntalk the second one here a conversation\nwith Microsoft president Brad Smith uh\nMicrosoft was on the wrong side of\nhistory when open source exploded at the\nbeginning of the century meaning like\nyeah our position against open source\nagainst Linux in general\num was the right one because when you\nthink of Open Source and you think of\nwhat it stands for the culture around it\nlike the end results and things like\nthat it's like very very powerful and\nvery very enabling and when you think of\nlike technology and the things that can\nchange because of embracing that type of\nculture obviously being against it\nit's just like not the right move from\nany from any Viewpoint so\nsome interesting dates when it comes to\nI guess Microsoft's relationship with\nwith uh open sources 2001 bad attempt at\nopensourcing.net if you're familiar.net\nis this entire ecosystem uh it was\noriginally made by Microsoft uh to\ndevelop like desktop apps web\napplications and things like that and in\n2001 essentially what they did was like\nthey grabbed.net and they pulled a lot\nof stuff out of it and then they sort of\nOpen Source the rest of it but a lot of\nthe stuff that they took out was like\nreally important and really these two\ntypes of things so that's why I put bad\nattempt at opensourcing.net\nuh 2009 they began contributing to the\nLinux kernel which I was surprised it's\nearlier than I thought 2012. I mean\nthere's a lot more that happens between\nlike there's multiple things that\nhappened yeah in many of these years but\nI just sort of cut out the ones that\nkind of stuck out to me\num me being someone who works in the\nAzure space works in the done at space\nworks in the cloud native space and\nwhatever okay\nso okay uh 2012 Azure begins hosting\nLinux virtual machines that is a lot\nlater than I thought and when you when\nyou start to think like the AWS market\nshare versus the Azure market share\nhaving the Linux virtual machine images\navailable in 2012 definitely contribute\nto that obviously AWS was around earlier\nbut I feel like when Azure started and\nif you immediately have these images\navailable you could have gained a little\nbit of Leverage there but so be it\nhistory is uh\nis already a thing there 2014 full.net\nis open source and the.net Foundation is\ncreated and then the notorious quote\nfrom satyana Della Microsoft life loves\nthe Linux it becomes a thing and um you\nknow that is quoted all the time now and\nit's big it's a big part of like\nthe open source code so now that\nMicrosoft is just you're reminded\nconstantly Microsoft loves clinics um\ncool 2015 Visual Studio code released\nand then they released with a Linux\nbuild as well which I think is important\nalso I think about just the\nthe adoption that that clinic that\nVisual Studio code has had is 100 thanks\nto uh releasing a Linux build and making\nit available across platform whereas\nlike you compare like you know the\nadoption of azure versus like Visual\nStudio code only with a couple years\napart right you see\num so it just goes to show that\nCommunity has always been that part of\nthe community has always been very\nimportant 2016. WSL has announced system\nactually joins the Linux foundation and\nPowershell is open source shout out to\nall my Powershell uh Fanatics in there\nuh but it's also open source\nuh 2017 I think WSL was also a massive\nmassive move I don't want to talk more\nabout WSL in the next\nthe the next session we're going to talk\nabout all about getting started with WSL\nI want to talk a little bit about the\narchitecture as well because I think\nit's just fascinating how it went from\nWSL to wsl2 so the just was like a quick\nlike one-liners WSL is was essentially\nusing some sort of like we could call it\nlike emulation or like\num whereas like wsl2 has a full like\nLinux kernel so very big difference yeah\nyeah yeah\num if you didn't know if you don't know\nreally much about what the Linux kernel\nis it's it's code that sits in main\nmemory when your machine is running and\nits goal is to assign the next task to\nthe CPU and the CPU will go to main\nmemory and kind of work with those tasks\nright so obviously having that in wsl2\nis a game changer\num but anyway 2017 Microsoft joins the\nopen source initiative and the cloud\nnative Computing Foundation cncf which\nis the foundation that is in charge of\nessentially like pushing promoting\nsupporting all of these open source\nprojects that are around uh Cloud native\ntechnology yeah like kubernetes\nis probably one of the biggest ones\nthere but like Maxwell has a lot of\nTechnologies in there too like functions\nand things like that as well uh another\nmassive move\nlet's move around here\n2018 GitHub acquisition big big move\nwhen you think of like open source where\nto where to host your code like yeah\nGitHub right there are a bunch of other\nplayers there too there's like gitlab\nthere's um bit bucket right but get some\nis just it has like market share there\nuh and then wsl2 with an actual Linux\nkernel is released in 2018 too so this\nwas also a couple years ago like I I\ndon't know why I still get the feeling\nof like it was only a couple years ago\nbut no yeah it felt like this was more\nrecent and now that you know in 2023\nit's like five years oh my God hmm\nyeah\num oh this one this is an interesting\npoint here\ndon't forget about Sublime and Adam but\nvs code is pretty much taken over\nbrackets was abandoned I know I remember\nAdam had like a really great had some\ngreat momentum yeah and I think I think\nit was like that first move to towards a\nmore like lightweight more customizable\ntype of editor and then vs code just\ndefinitely yeah yeah I think that's what\nI got like just talking about the\nexperience like I used Adam before and\nthen as soon as we as code came in it\ngave me more power in a certain sense\nbut the adapt like the adaptability was\nstill easy like because the other Ides I\nget that I just makes beginners or like\npeople who are starting to overwhelmed\nwith all the buttons and think about\nVisual StudioI've been 18 so since the GitHub\nacquisition and I open Visual Studio and\nI'm like\nI have no idea so I I use vs code given\nI guess what's different is my\nexperience with.net has always been like\nafter it's been open source so a lot of\nlike Cloud functionalities so we're\nthinking like serverless all that like\nmy experience with net was serverless\nfirst and I didn't do any of like done\nit framework things or anything like\nthat where where Visual Studio is like a\nmassive Game Changer but when I open it\nI'm like this is a lot this is way too\nmuch I I enjoy vs code a lot more but\nagain you know different tools for\ndifferent types of jobs right\nuh 2019 Visual Studio code releases as a\nsnap which is a way of installing\npackages like you have like Snap Store\nlike Snap CLI uh tool where you can\ninstall packages and uh what is it\nubuntu-based distribution yes snap yep\ncool uh which is important because you\nknow uh when you think of how you\ninstall things via CLI like uh Mac has\nBrew it's one of the most popular ones\nyeah Homebrew where you do like Brew\ninstall and you find the package that\nyou want to saw\num Windows has winget uh what's that\nthat's game changing too yeah\num chocolatey I think prior to yeah\nchoco yeah choco yeah yeah there might\nbe another one I think Windows has\nlagged in that aspect of like package\nmanagement yeah because like brew has\nbeen great forever but then you think of\nlike Linux and you have snap you have\nlike What APK\num so many different options but like\nthe thing about being a different Linux\nthis show is like different ones will\nhave different yeah their own right and\nembracing the ones that the majority of\nthe users in that dish show are using is\nit shows that you care it shows that\nyou're not like ignoring it's not you're\nnot just doing what favors you as a\ncompany so embracing something like\nSnaps are very very important\nand then Linux surpasses Windows usage\non azure\nvery important so when you think of\nazure you might think like oh it's a\nbunch of like Windows technology and\nlike it's Windows servers and you're\ngoing to be stuck on Windows 2008 R2 or\nsomething like that no Linux actually is\nthe most popular type of infrastructure\nwhen it comes to uses on Azure and that\nwill bring us over to\num the open first mindset so like I\nmentioned we went from going to\nuh Linux is a cancer to Linux is like\nthe most popular thing used on aperture\nand this whole like right shift in\nmindset right so it likes on Azure a\ncouple of interesting stats that I found\nuh 50 over 50 of VM cores in that are\ndeployed into Azure are Linux based I\nknow I mean chat can you let me know\nlike if you're deploying stuff in Azure\nlike what is it always Linux based like\nfrom I don't think I ever I don't think\nI've ever deployed anything Windows\nbased\nuh\nfor me not in a while\nwhen was the last time\num there was a.net\nframework 4.5 app\num at one of the previous companies I\nworked for and it needed to be moved\nfrom on-prem to you know like\nand it was lift and shift that you need\nany kind of\nyou know\nany kind of creative uh migrations it\nwas just okay we're gonna move this from\ndata center to a VM in the cloud and\nthat's where then did it back in 2019 I\nguess I guess yeah for supporting stuff\nmaybe like lift and shift like you\nmentioned it might you might have to but\nI think anything new the default is like\npeople just people just use Linux the\nsame so in the next that here is 60 of\nazure Marketplace images are Linux based\nand over 47 000 customers using Azure\nopen source databases so these are\nthings like Azure database for postgres\nnice space here Azure database for my uh\nmy singing L here Azure Cosmos DB I do\noh my goodness let me fix this right now\nbecause I want to make these notes\navailable for y'all if you all are\ninterested so\nlet me just quickly fix these on the\nspot Azure Cosmos TV and there we go so\nin terms of leveraging Linux let me\nshow you all we we were already on here\nbefore but this is more so talking about\nthe importance of bash but let me wait\nwhere is it here here so if we like hold\non I don't want to erase this but yeah\nso in terms of leveraging Linux like you\ndon't have to start\nright here like you don't you like if\nyou are like new company or like a new\ndeveloper trying to Leverage\nthis technology in Azure you don't have\nto always do like a VM or even like AKs\nlike I think a very like\nmaybe like a good first starter would be\nlike go and see like the highest level\nof obstruction services like what they\nhave to offer and then if you need any\nmore granularity acts granular Axis or\nyou need more customization for whatever\nor you need to manage something more and\nlike a managed service won't work for\nyou then kind of move your way down the\nladder to like okay so maybe like um\nAzure container apps like you need more\naccess to the underlying infrastructure\ngo AKs if you can't if you can't do AKs\ngo to like standard kubernetes deployed\non Virtual machines or something like\nthat but try to start more up here\nmainly because you're not going to be in\ncharge of a lot of stuff that makes a\nlot of these things tedious\num I'm pretty sure there's a lot of\nkubernetes admins out there that are\nlike I wish I wouldn't have to I wish we\ncould have this managed and then they\ncould dedicate themselves more to the\nbusiness logic more to the fun stuff I'm\nsure there's people out there that like\nit too but maybe if like start up in\nhere I think\nfor situations like a lift and shift\nthat might be more difficult you\ntypically end up utilizing VMS for that\nkind of stuff yeah but a lot of the\ncloud native stuff starts up here anyway\nright so\nuh let's see yeah so let me see if this\nthing is done deploying\nuh okay looks like it did so our API\nservice is here I actually have used\nthis image before template before so\nlet's see what happens when we load it\nup\nand then I'm going to use open up my\nportal as well ah so it's a to-do app\nand thanks to plural Dot and it's on\nit's in Java right yeah so it's written\nin Java we're gonna actually to open up\nthe template here so\nit's written in Java so this is our\nsource for our API here I don't really\nknow too much about Java so where would\nI find it in here source\nMaine Maine\noh my goodness there's so many oh no\nthat's not it there's so yeah I think\nit's the the to-do\nokay here it is I'm starting to find\nsome dot Java files that's the one thing\nabout Java that is all the scaffolding\nis hard to get uh especially if you're\ncoming from maybe like a python\nbackground or something like that\ngetting into like oh until all the like\nscaffolding is might be a little\nstraightforward not a straightforward\nbut anyway so yeah it is a Java code and\nthen if we go into the infra and then we\ngo into like the core we can see it's\nprobably hosts\nI want to see where it's calling a Linux\nbased image\nyeah here we go so this is bicep for\nthose who are not familiar bicep is an\nabstraction on top of arm which stands\nfor Azure resource manager arm is Json\nthat is you know as a way to interacts\nwith the Azure API Azure is\nessentially a massive API and that's how\nyou create resources and things like\nthat but working with Json is\nnotoriously difficult I'm not sure if\nyou all have worked with Json but it's\nmore so a language that's great for\nwork from computers working to computers\nor computers talking with computers it's\nnot very human friendly to look at so\nthen they came up with this awesome\nthing called bicep which has been around\nfor I think a couple of years which is\nan abstraction on top of it and it's\nways for you to like like this is a lot\nmore friendly than working with you know\nstraight up Jason right so yeah\nparameters and you've got like there's a\nlot you can make it as modular as\npossible uh but anyway yeah they're\nbasing this off uh this app service plan\nbased off Linux right\nso the API has deployed look at all this\nuh Swagger open API here nice you can\nhold on let's take a look at this so you\nhave an items uh and you have lists you\nlist API items API you get your schema\nthere and then you have your front in\nhere and then I'm gonna open this up in\nthe portal and we'll take a look at it\nin a second\nbut if I write down here fix I have to\nfix blog post I just want to see how it\nworks pick the blog post that is\nactually a task that I have to do and\nthen if I click on here I can do in\nprogress I think due date when is this\ndue let's say let's do I think they told\nme it's due on Monday so we'll save that\nthere\ncompleted okay cool and then you can\nhave I think additional lists so like\nmaybe we call this content\nand then we create like shopping I don't\nknow shopping I just love that how the\nUI is really\nsimilar to Azure portal oh that's right\nI didn't notice that yeah I'm like I've\nseen this\nyou're right I wonder if they I bet I\nbet they did it on purpose they're smart\nthat's smart I gotta ask Savannah if\nthey did that on purpose\nuh where's like oh can I move can I move\nthis hold on how do I move this can I no\nI can't\ninteresting okay anyway so yeah it's a\nto-do list right so if I probably\nrefresh my API\nand then I go to\nitems I guess get the items can I just\nrun this I don't feel like I need to\nput anything in try it outoh hold on I got no this is not the\nright one this item id items no I just\nwant to get all the items\nor maybe let's get all the lists first\nokay because is that\ntry it outexecute\nwhy it lists ID oh get a specific list\noh here we go sorry that was wrong okay\nnow I'll do this here cool so we're\nseeing that it does a curl\nand then we have our list that we just\ncreated my list content description so\nif I grab one of\nlet's grab a shopping one let's grab\nthis ID so now I can list by\nlist items by let's see lists this ID\nitems I know I just want\nlists\nthis one this one here list ID\ntry it out paste this in here execute\nand then I have my items bananas cool so\nit works uh and hold on a second let me\nlog in first without everyone looking at\nmy email address\nuh yeah and I didn't do anything all I\ndid was run uh let me share my thing\nagain\nACD\ntemplate name and then up\neasyd up oh my\ntop of this\nI did this easyd up template to do Dash\nJava mango Dash a CA who stands for\nAzure container apps and it asked me for\na couple of parameters and I didn't have\nDocker running so\nthere's that I'm going to delete it in a\nlittle bit but let me show you what it\nlooks like in the portal so yeah you can\nessentially deploy something with one\ncommand straight to Azure now what did I\ncall it does anyone remember react or\ndemo I think yeah cool so let's take a\nlook at what actually gets deployed here\nso remember I talked about the level of\nabstraction like obviously you're not\ngoing to see like yeah type like Linux\nright but it's like a container app we\nhave one container app to container two\ncontainer apps container up environment\nwe've got a cosmos DB for oh this uses\n to be nice\ncontainer registry it's deployed also a\nshared dashboard key Vault log analytics\nworkspace and application insights let's\nopen one of these let's open this\nenvironment thing here\num\nlet's go on to oh Dapper components I\nneed to look at like where do I find the\nimage that it's based that is a good\nquestion it's the container\nI think it should be\num\nI I\nI know what\num the developer CLI does but I just\ndon't know like what I know it uses\nbicep but I don't know if it creates\nlike a new container image\num too it should it'd be based off so\nthis is the image ah oh here it is yeah\nthere we go perfect next right so anyway\na bunch of resources get deployed thanks\nto that uh someone said here\nterraform does the same thing it's just\ncross platform independent correct uharm bicep is like Cloud promotion\ncorrect yes it is an infrastructure as\ncode Tool uh IAC but bicep is just the\none that the no actually the developer\ntemplate uses by except right in the\nback end but it also has support for\nterraform I believeuse their form right here so you can\nhear from our bicep like we're I again\nthis pushes the whole mindset of like\nwe're gonna Embrace what the people want\npeople want Linux people want terraform\nwe're going to do it obviously we're\ngoing to start with like the stuff that\nwe know the most because you know if you\nwant to like get developed stuff quickly\nthat's where you're gonna head to right\num but then we're gonna Embrace what the\npeople want all right so I wanted to\ntalk to you all about and this is why I\nbrought Rich up here\nso how we actually leverage actually\nhold on now we can start here\nso I stuck the learn to Cloud logo here\nI don't know if people are familiar with\nlearner Cloud uh it is an open source\nguide to learn the fundamentals of cloud\ncomputing and it probably sits like if\nwe go back here in the context of web\nlike you could have VM and then you\nprobably have something like\na static site maybe on job storage and\nthen you can have something up here like\nAzure static web apps so we decided to\ngo like let's go high top in terms of\nabstraction as I can because we're two\npeople maintaining this website on our\nfree on our free time we get like do you\nhave data on how many users we get yeah\nlike\nyep I do have it so for context last\nyear we had 73\n000 users\num and around\n150k sessions so 150 000 sessions on our\nwebsite which was earlier just a static\npage hosted on GitHub pages so not you\nknow best performant uh SEO optimized\nthing right and for this year since we\nmoved as Gwen was saying to static web\napps right and then we'll I'm guessing\ngo and we'll talk more about the\narchitecture side of things for January\nitself we had 6 000 users\num we had around yep we had around 12\n000 sessions for just one month\num and sorry my bad\nthat's for oh my God okay 6 000 users\nonly for February and we are just\nhalfway through February oh my goodness\nokay let's just do Feb here Feb Feb 2023\nand then wait what were the static the\nstats for 20 I guess 2022\num 73 000 users\n73 73\n000 users how many sessions\n150 okayfor all the whole year and then to now\nwe're at our Azure static web apps just\nthe month of February we have 6 000\nusers in 12 000 sessions yeah that's\nlike 15 days\nyeah so we get some traffic that's what\nI'm trying to say\num and we've been able to sort of\nmaintain this with very very little uh\nvery little management I'll keep like a\nlot of the work we've been doing is\nimplementing stuff like GitHub actions\nbuilding apis like a lot of the fun\nstuff and we haven't really been worried\nabout our our traffic or scaling or\nanything like that so here's like this\nis my portal this is where I log into\nevery single day and I check like some\nside hits uh as you can see like for the\npast I don't know we'll take a look at\nsight hits are not the same as site\nvisits I should say but it kind of gives\nyou an idea of like oh like what kind of\ntraffic you're getting like let's look\nat the last like seven days\nin the last seven days an average uh\nhold on where'd it go127\n430 uh\nside hits\nand then we also have an API running uh\nthat serves our Cloud dictionary which\nI'll show you in a second as well and\njust so we can get a feel for the\nuh we'll do like I don't know how long\nI've had this I'm just gonna no hold on\nwe're gonna do last seven days so\ncompare the same we've had four thousand\nwow that is surprising four thousand\nseven four thousand seven hundred and\nsixty uh hits to this API in the last\nseven days so again just so you can get\na feel for what kind of traffic we're\nwe're working on uh for context learn to\nwhy don't I have it in my history learn\nto Cloud this is the site that we\nmaintain that thing that loaded right\nhere this is actually the API so what\ngets refreshed here like that traffic\nthat I showed you which is like four\nthousand something\nis the this little box that fills in\nhere so if I refresh this I feel like\nit's an ambulance coming hold on you\nwant to talk about this while I mute\nmyself sure\nyep so the the box that you see in the\nMiddle where it says here's a random\nCloud definition uh it calls the API\nthat Gwen has built and is hosted in\nAzure functions\num every time you refresh the page so\nthat you get a random Cloud definitionthank you\num I forgot to close my window that's\nwhy it's so loud uh my mistake yeah but\nanyway we have this API here people can\ncontribute if you're interested in\ncontributing it's very\nlow-hanging fruit wave contributing to\nopen source you can hit submitted\ndefinition it'll take you to GitHub\nright the the rest of I guess the meat\nand potatoes of the site itself is if\nyou click on guide it'll guide you\nthrough essentially the\nI want I like to call the pillars of\ngetting into Cloud engineering and it's\na guide written by the both like the\nboth of us taken from the experiences\nthat we did coming from like\nnon-traditional educational backgrounds\nmeaning we didn't go to college uh and\nthen working our way into a cloud role\nand sort of we look back at it how would\nwe sort of distill this information in\nsort of like a road map or a guide right\nso what it is is\num we have like different phases we talk\nabout bash and the importance of\nnetworking programming fundamentals\nCloud platform mentals devops\nfundamentals and Cloud security\nfundamentals and if you just sort of\nwork your way through each phase uh each\nphase will give you like why does this\nface matter in the context of cloud like\nhow do you break this down some\nresources that we recommend we try to\nkeep a lot of these uh again resources\nagain open source and free some of them\nmight be paid but I don't think there's\nanything over like 100 and I think the\nappeal of it being like an open source\nlike a compilation of Open Source type\nof information is also what encourages\nothers to like give it a shot because\nyou know we're not selling anything\nthere's no charge this isn't a boot camp\nor something like that that's more smart\nseeing power it's more so to empower\npeople to go and learn right so again\nyou gotta you gotta feel for uh the\nprojects and then things that you should\nbe familiar so you can test your\nknowledge and you know certifications\nthat might be useful and all that kind\nof stuff right uh we have a page for\nprojects where you can look at\nindividual projects if you want to get\nHands-On more study researchers are in\nhere so okay right we have have uh this\nis a new addition a search we can search\nfor here\num what else do we have here\nuh we have a road map in terms of like\nthe content that's on here that's pretty\nmuch what we're working with but yeah we\nget a decent amount of traffic and all\nthis is hosted on\nso let's go in here\num I have so many groups to clean up and\nyou can do better at this everything is\nhosted on inside of one Resource Group\nit's called RG Dash learn to Cloud\nbecause we're very creative and the meat\nand potatoes is this static web app we\nare paying for a\nPremium plan so I think there's like a\nlike a free tier for static web apps\nwhich for probably the majority of\npeople if it's like a personal site or\nsomething like that uh the free tier is\nmore than enough but we figured that\ngiven the kind of traffic that we're\ngetting we most likely need to host\nsomething with a little bit more power\nand scalability and things like that so\nwe decided to go with it I think it's\nlike\n10 starts at ten dollars a month\nsomething like that and then it will I\nthink so yeah you have additional costs\ndepending on like certain parameters we\nalso have\nuh whatever we have in here environs\nyeah we have a staging environment yeah\nwe encourage I'm going to open up our\nGitHub we encourage new people or just I\ndon't know people trying to get Hands-On\nin general to contribute to the project\nas much as we can so we let me open up\nour project so we have a backlog here\nwith just things that we're working on\nuh and the the preview part the staging\nparts I'll show you in a little second\nuh is really really helpful for us to\nget other people to help to work on\nthese things with us uh so for example\nthese we're gonna have to add some more\ntickets to the ship because we're\nlooking a little low here yes we\nwe just finished our first print of the\nyear\num and that's why it's looking like very\nless issues I think we had like yeah we\nhad like 13 or 14 issues open last month\nand we just went through them\num and there were a lot of community\nmembers too who took like who\nparticipated in helping us you know\nclean this up\num so I'll add some more issues that we\nplan on having in in learn to Cloud yeah\noh I also forgot to add that we have\nseveral languages yes English French\nPortuguese and what's the last one\nNepali Nepali so that is a community\ncontribution as well so anyway we have\nour backlog right so we try to con\ncontribute as much as we can to\nget others to help out uh and get\nHands-On and the cool part is you want\nto talk about because this is also Linux\nbased our workflows\nyep sure which which one should I open\num the for a close folder\nthis one yeah okay and which one and\nthen static web apps is good\ncool\nyeah so this also runs on a container so\nif you don't know what GitHub actions\nare they are basically\ncicd like they help you enable CI CD on\nyour open source project so you get\nthere's a generous free tier I think I\ndon't remember the numbers correctly but\nI believe there's like 2 000 minutes uh\nfor a public repo for a month and\nbasically you can run GitHub actions to\neither build or deploy your websites\nartifacts releases\nwe use GitHub actions for three things\none of them is publishing two are Azure\nstatic web apps whenever a new you know\npull request is merged to the staging\nBranch then it goes to the staging\nenvironment and if it goes to the main\nbranch you know that's a release and we\nuse Ubuntu latest as our container as\nyou can see right on the line 17 it says\nruns on Ubuntu latest so it uses that\ncontainer to you know do a bunch of\nactions steps jobs that we need to build\nthis so this is based on docusary which\nis again an abstraction from react so\nyeah yeah this uses react\nand so whenever we do npm run build\nwhich you might be familiar with you\nknow that runs on and Ubuntu container\nso yeah\nwe are using Linux here too yeah so this\ndeploys to Azure which is Linux the\nhostess site what else do we have what\nis this code ql so code ql is it also\nruns on ubuntulet everything runs on\nUbuntu latest for for our actions\num this just does a code scanning so no\nmalicious uh PRS are normally just code\nis merged to our beautiful open source\nproject because we don't want that and\nevery time a new PR is created this just\ndoes analysis and it's a tool made\navailable from GitHub\nvery cool yeah and uh let me see\nit's kind of all the I guess that's\nwe have work queued up to leverage uh\nLinux stuff so for example let me go to\nour project here yeah I was going to say\nwe have Dev container support now so\nthat oh we do yes we do for those who\naren't familiar diff containers another\nabstraction on top of limits essentially\nit emulates your so if you use like vs\ncode you open up a Dev container uh and\nwhat it does is it your vs code will act\nas if it exists in whatever environment\nyou've described in your Dev container\nso you don't have to install things\nlocally uh you don't have to like or\nlike generally across your entire system\nand like you like I think of um\nmaybe like one of the best examples is\nyou know how python uses environments\nyeah\nDev container is essentially\nwill would replace that kind of\nfunctionality right yeah and it's like\nfor the complete project and like we\nespecially when we you know saw that\nthere's so much Community contribution\nwe wanted it to be easy to for people to\nlike\non board and clone the repo and like\njust get started working with and they\ndon't have to deal with npm packages you\nknow broken Dev dependencies so I think\nthat was the thought behind it\nabsolutely our and here is where our API\nlives our API is let me actually show\nyou all that\noh where is that RG Cloud dictionary our\nAPI watch it be on a Linux based uh like\na Windows based image apps okay sorry\nwe're using uh Linux once again for our\nAPI that powers or our function our our\nCloud dictionary we have in this\nfunction app we have a couple uh\nendpoints here and then people can\ncontribute to that versus we have to\nautomate this I just\nthe issue I'm coming into with this like\npeople will submit their definitions and\nlike a Json format I manually have to uh\nlook at them and then we can add it to\nthe well we have an endpoint to create a\ndefinition uh so we just send it as post\nbut the issue is like we could easily\nautomate this with a GitHub action again\nbased ubuntu-based type of action but I\ndon't know of a good way to avoid\nuh plagiarism because what I do is like\nI read the definition that they've\nprovided and then I kind of like search\nthe internet like really quick and see\nif like if it's literally a copy paste\nfrom somewhere else and I'll be like I\ndon't want this is something valid like\nit needs to be a definition that you've\ncome up with originally so I don't\nreally know how we can automate that I'm\nthinking we could potentially leverage\ndurable functionsto help the process a little bit but I\nstill think there's going to be manual\nIntervention which yeah\nI think\num like the first part of the problem\nthat you mentioned with GitHub actions\ncan be done and we can still have that\nmanual check where you go in and see if\nnobody is copying and pasting but as\nsoon as you hit merge pull request like\nthe adding it to the you know\nthe database is done automatically by a\nGitHub action and then we can figure out\nif there are apis that exist for you\nknow sentiment analysis and plagiarism\nthat we can leverage to perform certain\nchecks before it's merged\nonce open openai API is available we can\njust say like is this copied from\nsomewhere and it gives us a yes or no we\ncan do it off off of that that would be\npretty sick uh that pretty much covers\nwhat I wanted to talk about uh Linux on\nAzure again there's so many more\npotentials I just use the use case of\nlike Azure container apps with Java and\nthen our own use case which Azure static\nweb apps Linux base Azure functions\nLinux base but depending on like your\nworkflow you're going to want to\nprobably use something different but the\noptions are there next uh next week we\nare talking about can we make sure to\ndrop the link session for next week\nwe're going to be talking about WSL WSL\nis magical we should use WSL as well for\nlike your day-to-day so this is WSL as\nyou can see I have the windows terminal\nUbuntu image open here and then if I do\nlike am I inside of the yeah I'm\nprobably inside of this if I just open\nthis up like code dot here this will\nalso open up in the context like you see\nin the bottom right so starting vs code\nin WSL so it opened up you're\nessentially working within\num like your whatever you have you're\nusing some of my case Ubuntu within wsl2\nwell it's telling me I have to install a\nbunch of things here too\nbut this is different from working off\nlike\nlike vs code working in\nin\nWindows because it's yeah I mean it is\nworking in Windows but it's in a WSL\nright\num yeah especially with wsl2 it's really\nnative yeah like really close to Native\nXP really cool yeah especially with\nsomething like uh what is it system D\nlike the the initial but there are a\ncouple tools that you install like\num to improve this kind of experience\nbut we're going to be talking more about\nthat in the next session which is the\nlast session for Linux related stuff so\nbe sure to check that out uh and do we\nhave any questions that we can\ntalk about or answer before we leave a\nlot of people were talking aboutum I saw something about um and\nyeah a lot of people talking about bicep\nthe technicalities of arm and bicep oh\nis a great a great conversation let me\nsee here\noh\n[Music]\nI feel like it's just like people asking\ntalking to each other which is great\nanswering their own questions yeah open\nAI has an API available for a limited\namount of tokens 4K per per query the\nway they divide tokens is interesting\ntoo because like\none token isn't necessarily a word and\nalso like the more complex a word is the\nmore tokens it can it's very interesting\nI was reading about it yesterday or like\nthe day before because we were thinking\nabout leveraging it for uh some learning\ncloud stuff\num yeah and now that I have it in my\nBing like I was I saw the email today I\nwas like you're approved Oh no you're\noff the waitlist like\num so that's great let me see here what\ndo we got there's also a lot of comments\nabout people want to use Mariner the\nMicrosoft Linux distro oh the yeah yeah\nI don't think it's available for\nconsumer use that's what uh AKs is built\nI mean you can go in and build it like\nthey have all the instructions if you\nneed but why would you want to like\ndefinitely don't use it like definitely\ndon't use it as like your desktop like\ndefinitely definitely not um I don't\neven think it has like I mean you could\nslap a UI component on top of it but I\ndon't see why anyone would want to do it\nbut I think that's a like interesting to\nlearn like the nitty-gritty of how\nsomething like AKs I don't really know\nwhat else is built on top of it I'm\npretty sure many many more\num services but I know AKs is\num\nyeah I think I saw the repo once I was\nlike this is freaking cool I would it's\nlike one of those things on like your\nendless to-do list to check out yeah\nyeah but yeah also just for those who\num um joins\nat the sort of later half I mentioned\nBachelor beginner series is out\nwe will have hold on let me share we\nhave a few more minutes I'm gonna take\nadvantage of this to just share what we\nactually cover in the\nwait send this over here uh one second\nI'm gonna open up my\nscreen\nAKA dot Ms bash for beginners beginners\ndid I spell that right yes so 20 videos\nit should take you\na couple hours to get through\nuh so the first one is just introducing\nyourself setting up the environment we\nopted to go for GitHub code spaces\nbecause GitHub is free anyone can have a\nGitHub account and then you get up to 60\nhours of free code space use per month\nand that is plenty to cover what we're\ncovering the series but if you have bash\navailable to you uh somehow which is\nprobably pretty easy to get like WSL\nUbuntu you have bash available\num you can switch to the bash shell on\nMac OS if you want to I think the\ndefault is like f\nright up shell official but if you don't\nwant to you don't want to smell locally\nyou don't want to change anything\nlocally you can use code spaces and we\ngive you instructions on that\nuh we talk about how to get help so man\nand help commands we talk about\nnavigating so CD PWD pop D push D\ncommands how to list content how to find\nfiles which where is comments like that\nhow to work with directories make deer\nuh remove D or copy move things like\nthat view contents more or less tail\nhead grep environment variables we\ncovered yeah EnV we covered the path\napartment variable export redirection\nand pipeline grabbing the input or the\noutput of a certain command sending it\nover to another command for the\nfiltering out that that is the beauty in\nthe creativity and just plain Arts\nutilizing a command line and reduction\npipeline is all about that modifying\npermissions how many times have you gone\nto a tutorial and you put chmod 777\nwithout knowing what you're doing gone\nare the days of you not knowing what\nyou're doing because you're going to\nwatch this video and you're going to\nunderstand what you're actually doing\nthere too\nwe talk about shebang's comments we talk\nabout commands in bash scripts variables\nhow to set them Scopes initial\nstatements if then else case statements\nso that's to be the case statement to\nmatch patterns what are functions so how\nto make your code more modular functions\nparameters defining functions what are\nLoops while until uh I think there's\nthree different Loops in bash we cover\nthat as well here and then we put it all\ntogether in that final video on how to\norder bash script where we actually\ndeploy a resource Group to Azure which\nis a free thing you're not going to pay\nfor anything and if you don't want to do\nit don't do it you can just watch it to\nget the understanding what it actually\ndoes uh 20 videos released today I still\nget the comments of like I can't believe\nMicrosoft is doing this like I did not\nexpect this from Microsoft it's like\nyeah and they they supported me for the\npast couple months being like yeah go\ndedicate as much time as you want to go\ndo this so it's really really cool nice\num so hopefully people don't have any\nplans for the weekend and they can go\nwatch it\nlook at this I just saw the bachelor\nbeginners and amazing for a person like\nme I think I've heard three people\nalready that said that they're into the\ncourse I'm like wow that is impressive\num thank you all for the endless support\nand hopefully we can do more if we're\nbeginners series\num depending on I have to get a feel for\nwhat people want I know the bachelor was\none that was requested a lot so that's\nwhy I ended up doing it but I'll get a\nbetter feel and we'll see maybe towards\nthe end of the year I'll spend another\ntime another couple months doing\nsomething like that yes any final words\nif anyone wants to contribute to learn\nto Cloud just go to learn to cloud.guide\nour roadmap is on the top and we have a\nbunch of and if there's something like\nthere that you don't see but you still\nwant to help out with let us know we'd\nbe happy to we have a Discord as well\nyeah if especially if the the issues\nthat are there already and that is not\nsomething that you can help with Gwen\njust showed you the cloud definition\num so contribute to the definitions\ndefinition yep 10 minutes it'll take you\n10 minutes I promise and if you need\nhelp submit the definition tell me what\nyou need help and I'll help you out we\ncheck these every single day\nbecause we don't care about work-life\nbalance unfortunately all right thank\nyou everyone for praying and out thank\nyou Richard for coming on last minute\nalways appreciate you and for everyone\nelse I will see you next week where we\ntalk about WSL too\npeace out peace",
