a\nlike let's try to hit 100 people to\nstream so share with people let's hang\nout for a little bit let's talk all this\ncrazy stuff\nwhat is 343 rip 343 stuff\nwhat is\nthree four threeI still have to get a new keyboard this\none I'm I just I'm so sad I don't want\nto let it go\nyou have to get a new keyboard or you\ngot a new keyboard no I have to my cat\num\nmessed it up\nuh um spelled something or yeah yeah\nso after a new one I just don't know\nwhich one to get because I can't find\nthe one that I like a lot\nlike remember I was saying that I should\njust buy two of these or something like\nthat like stop okay you did send me I\nthought you did stock up\nI did not I was like\nthe chemistries yeah it's very\nappropriatevery appropriate for the week\num the University of industry is an\nAmerican video game developer located in\nredern Washington part of Xbox game\nstudios\ncrazy\nso there was\nuh what's the number for gcp 12 000 laid\noff today yeah 12 000 laid off at gcp\ntwelve thousand light off at a Amazon\nnot just AWS Amazon\nand then obviously the 10 000 not sure\nyeah I think ten thousand\nuh Microsoft but\nI\ndon't know if everyone's been\nlike told or I don't know really but\nthat's like remember that they're\nthey mentioned\num\nwhat a week it's like personally it's\nlike\nevery time Outlook makes a sound\nit's very\nit's very use a lot of anxiety anxietyso there's thatuh I just discovered this discover that\nI have to rebuild my entire VMware lab\nsetup including a new domain controllerum\nis this like a work thing yeah I'm\nassuming this is working yeah and like\nwhat happened I'd love to know some\nbackstory here\nbecause I build an entire VMware it says\nVMware lab so that's why I feel like is\nthis a personal setup kind of thing\ncould be\nwhat up HC how you doing Lucas oh\nthere's two Lucas's in there there's one\nLucas Henderson and one\njust Lucas\nEric how you doing Alex how you doing\nLucas asks what is the reason for these\nlayoffs pleaseuh probably I don't know they say like\nyou know economy and all that kind of\nstuff so that's\nreally all I know\nAlex this year they were looking for an\nexcuse to play copycat huhyeah\nI think they all have been saying that\nyou know we\nhave been hiring so\nmuch over the last\nfive ten years\num and that was not sustainable\nand they're realizing it now with the\neconomy collapsing so that's the same\nkind of sentiment I've been hearing\naround from like leadership and stuff\nI got a fantastic question let me bring\nit up\nhold on I got this really good question\nI was like I want to answer this on\nstream I don't I didn't even really\nthink about it I said I want to think\nabout an answer on stream\nokay\nokay it says here\nuh wait hold on where is it uhuh okay uh\nif Microsoft were to lay you off\nobviously with Severance but then want\nto rehire you in say six months would\nyou go back regardless of the job you\ndid or did not acquire in the interim do\nyou love the culture at Microsoft or any\ncompany enough to trust them again\ncompany loyalty versus modern corporate\nmodel are protect profits and sharehold\ninterests at all costs no I don't think\nit's a right answer but I'm curious\nso the question is\nwould I return to Microsoft if I was\noffered a job after being\nafter being laid off so Saget laid off\nthen six months later like hey we want\nyou back would you come back\nand then there's other kind of questions\nabout uh company loyalty and stuff like\nthat\num so let's break that down that first\nanswer is I guess it depends on what I\nwas doing the\nthe next like my natural\nI think I'm in a position where I I\nwould would most likely\ntake a lot more to decide on what my\nnext role would be so if I do join\nanother place I wouldn't probably be\nlooking to leave right away\num because you know you know I think it\nprobably takes a couple months to land a\nrole in this again actually I don't\nreally know but you know six months is\nrelatively short\nto like leave a place especially if it's\none that I've made like a very Mindful\nand aware decision to join nowthat means that doesn't mean like I\nwouldn't go away go I was just thinking\nlike most likely that's the situation\nthat I might find myself in so probably\nnot but that doesn't have anything to do\nwith that like I'm upset at Microsoft or\nanything like that no absolutely not\nit's just probably I'm at a job that I\nI enjoy or something like that uh\nwhat about you what if you were laid off\nwould you go back\nI was going to ask you like a follow-up\nquestion what if they reach out to you\nin a yearagain it depends on like what the role\nis what I'm currently doing I think this\nperson is more so trying to ask me like\nif I'm going to hold some kind of grudge\nagainst the any company that lays me off\nand\nif it's done in a respectful way in a\nway that like they did their best they\nabsolutely could to handle it then yeah\nso be it\num\nyeah I don't think I would hold any\ngrudges unless it was done in a way that\nlike humiliated it me or made me uh made\nmy my job search for like after that\nmore difficult than maybe but\nI don't think so they\nthe second part to that is like company\nloyalty\nI don't necessarily think I have loyalty\nto\nany company or or brand or anything like\nthat\num I know I like YouTube and a lot of\nstuff that I do is like there's a lot of\nazure and stuff like that but that's\nmainly because that's what I was working\nwith before I worked at Microsoft and\nthat's obviously what I work with now if\nI left and was at a shop that like I got\nreached out for like an AWS developer\nrole the other day and I'm not\nnecessarily opposed to it but\nyeah I don't really think that I'm tied\nto certain technology I like I truly do\nlike Azure I truly do enjoy working with\nMicrosoft products but if another\nopportunity came along and uh then you\nknow you'd probably see more of that\nstuff in my channel I think I would want\nto stick to Cloud but the loyalty to a\ncompany isn't necessarily\nlike massive that doesn't mean that I\nmean I guess the other the flip side of\nthat is like I really enjoy the role\nthat I do I enjoy the team I enjoy the\nwork\num I enjoy the culture and that\num so I would like to see here but if it\ndoesn't happen then you know you're\ngonna you gotta move forward you gotta\nfind whatever the next the next thing is\nhold on my\ngirlfriend close the door and then the\ncat is in here\nthe cat wants to get outum let's see\nhow how do you feel what do you think\nabout company loyalty\nyeah I know\num I think it's pretty much same\nsentiment that you know it's the tools\nlike I use both AWS and Azure I\nuse twilio to build the stuff the\ncontent the talks I still use Python\nright\nand if it if there is a rule that aligns\nwith all of thatafter twilio so saying that if I get\nlaid off and I go work somewhere else\nwhere maybe I have to learn gcp which\nwas the case a few months ago right or\nlike last year\num yeah I don't believe that\nI would leave a company within six seven\nmonths where I was on boarded and\nalso being the role that I needed\ndesperately or not desperately but you\nknow when I was laid off like I don't\nthink I would leave that role within the\nshort amount of time to go and like\nbounce back to\nuh tulior\nMicrosoft in your caseone thing I will guarantee you is that\nand I was talking to Richard before so\nthis is why it's relevant it's if I did\nget laid off\nI would make\nvideos up until I found my next thing\nbecause I'm looking for a job without\nhaving a job is something that I haven't\nexperienced\nfor a couple of years\nso now that I have way more years of\nexperience and a way different mindset\nthat I did when it originally happened\nto me I'd be curious to see how I would\nhandle that so my channel might turn\ninto like unemployment Vlogs for a\nlittle bit until I find whatever the\nnext thing thing is so\nyeah but ultimately business is business\nuh layoffs are going to happen and it\nsucks it really does but it really does\nmake a difference how companies handle\nit and I think that is what matters more\nfor me in making a decision if I wanted\nto like come back or not\numumgave up on company loyalty years ago\nperhaps my company just made me jaded\nthough there are companies that\ndefinitely suck that's for sure one\nthousand percent\nyeah I wouldn't know ever go back to a\ncompany that laid me off\nuh\nuh malix's just Malik's is just like\ndubia said how they do says more about\nthe company than the staff restructuring\nby itself\nyeah I had two companies call me back\nafter they quarterly feelings I said no\nthankseven if they offered more compensation\nas form of apology\nI move forward no sense in looking back\nso this is\nthis is kind of interesting becausea lot of people being laid off it's like\nyou know these are people who are most\nlikely very like productive great\nemployees greater what they do so\nit's not necessarily that they're being\nlaid off because they're not worth it or\nsomething like that soI don't really think it's like if you\nwere in that role and then you go back\nlike it's because you're not taking\nsteps forward in your career\nso I don't want this this there to be\nthe stigma that people being laid off or\nbecause they're not good at what they do\nbecause that's not the case\nyeah yeah and especially in this like\nthe in this I guess wave of layoffs\numso yeah but people will make different\ndecisions based on their own their own\nlife for sure\nyou two are very talented have you\nthought about making your own business\nas a contractor if you got laid off\nsomeone said this the other day I can't\nremember who mentioned this I think it\nwas on the stream that I did I think I'd\nconsider it\num\nI think it might be difficult between us\nboth because worship is based in Canada\nand I'm based here in the US so\nbuilding a business or starting a\nbusiness yeah we're both in different\ncountries might be leave to like have we\nwill have to read a lot of paperwork\nyeah and there's probably a lot of stuff\nthat would be maybe limitations or\nsomething like that um\nbut I mentioned that I would want to\nturn learn a cloud into something that\ncould make money I was going to say that\nwe already like kind of work on\nsomething together so that's my my\nloyalty is to learn the cloud that's the\nonly loyalty I'll have when it comes to\nsome sort of cloud entity it's to learn\nthe class why we both have signs here\nuh I was a high performer with bonuses\nstill got laid off yeah yeah no one is\nno one is safe when it comes to layoffs\nthere's no way of being layoff proof\noh yeah\nit's just if you're if your whole team\nneeds to go you're you're they will take\nyour whole team off and that's why I\nthink your point about you know it's not\nthe talent or the skill that people are\nbeing laid off uh based on their like\nyou know skill or Talent it's not that\ncurrently at least because if you think\nof it in a way that you know they were\nstill engineers at Google they were\nstill engineers at Microsoft so they\nhave been working at least\nmajority of them have been working for a\nyear or more right yeah um so they got\nto be like good skilled uh individuals\nit's just a business need that has\nchanged now and it's caused\nto be laid off\nyeah there's a bunch of different\nreasons why it's like it's hard to\nit's hard to pinpoint and it's like a\nlot of science either yeah uh someone\nsaid okay conspiracy time people are\nmaking too much money so fire everyone\nbecause inflation isn't working\nI've heard this a lot\nlike they're just gonna have to fire\npeople until I mean and it's just not in\nTech this is in general\nfire people until uh this inflation\nsituation gets uh situatedit was looking something up I haven't\nbeen laid off before but I've returned\nto company slice after leaving themI don't think I've ever been in a\nposition where I've wanted to return to\na company that I've been at but if I did\nwant to I'd reach out that's why it's\nimportant to not burn Bridges\nyeah yeah\num I think yeah you know about this\nstory about me considering the\ncounteroffer that I was given at UCI to\nstay yes but I definitely blowing the\nbridge there with the company that I was\nhired at yeah yeah but\nyeah I've never been in a situation\nwhere\nlike I was laid off or fired and then\nlater reached outum that's the closest I've been is given\na counter offer and\num to join the devops team in the state\nyeah no I get it\nmaybe to monetize learn to Cloud you\ncould have more advanced projects\npaywall so this is the vicious circle\nthat I was talking about the other day\nif we turn\nmonetization like a goal for learning\ncloud and content that means we turn\ninto course makers that means we have to\ncreate courses and as they need to be\nupdated we need to update courses and\nthen we kind of fall into the circle of\nlike well how do we make up skill how do\nwe you know\nforeign\nyeah like how do we maintain our skills\nrelevant if we're focused on making\ncourses\num\nso that's why I really haven't perceived\nthat it's also why I don't want to\nbecome a YouTuber full-time or make\ncourses for a living or anything like\nthat it's just because it's not really\nwhat I'm interested in\num just the issue with like when you put\nsomething behind a paywall it's like\npeople have expectations\nso\nit's tough that's not something I'm\npersonally interested in doingI want to learn to be an entrepreneur\nand using cloud or somewhere on cloud\nrelated business don't know how or what\nyeah but it's my goal I have um this\ninterest inuh moving to South America and opening a\ncloud consultant the consultancy agency\nconsultant agency there like later on\numbut not here\nuh\nthey often lay off high salaries staffs\nand new projects initiatives that aren't\nthe main Revenue generating yeah but at\nthe same time they\nthey I saw there was some layoffs in\nazure\nsoit's like there's no real there's no\nreal rule here I feel like if they just\nwant to lay you off they will lay you\noff and they'll try to make up a rule to\nsay like to justify it but ultimately\nanyone can get laid off I don't like\nthat people try to like\nI think it's I I think it's natural\nhuman\nuh like attitude to be like oh what can\nI do or like how can I\njustify or how can I I make sure it's\nnot going to be me like oh like okay I'm\nin a very like high Revenue uh\ngenerating project I'm gonna be fine\nbecause I found myself doing this it's\nlike\nI performed very well I got a great\nbonus I got a promotion like I'm totally\nfine but then that kind of gives I feel\nlike that sets you up for more\nof like a like stress or more of like an\nexpectation if it does ultimately happen\nto you I think it's better to just\naccept the fact that like they're gonna\nlay off no matter what so\nyou can leave it open if you wantyeah\num\nI don't know if it was set up this way\nbut this microphone seems to have an\necho\ndo you have an echo do you hear me with\nan echo not you I think it's meum you know how you have that monitor\nsaying where you hear yourself\nyeah I don't have that on but I still\nhear you like hear my voice\ncoming into my headphones I don't know\nif it'sdo you have like the tab open somewhere\nin YouTube and you're sharing desktop\naudio no\nno okay who's whose audio is is it is\nthis his repeating or is it mine that's\nrepeating it's you I feel yeah I can\nhear ithold on let's seeyeah someone just confirmed this it's\nmine yeah his mic has an echoodd is it pulling\nit's not a bad Echo it's his his his\nuh\n[Music]\nbut it's not that bad so it's like a\ndelay like you're hitting my voice twice\nI guess no thank you for letting us know\nMark I just don't know what it is\nbecause mine is set to audiolet me see because yeah I can definitely\nhear my voice\nin my headphones which I don't\nit's like I don't have monitoring on\nwait so let me mute myself and do you\nstill hear yourself like continue\ntalking okay\nyeah I don't hear myself\nokay so it's me\nall right let me figure stuff out\ncontinue answering questions in the chat\nokayand yeah thank you Chad for letting us\nknow\num yeah I definitely not hear myself so\nlet let me know if it is good now so if\nthere is no Echo let us know so that\nmeans it's something going on\num Gwen's new\ntool\nif not then I'll try some other audio\ndevices how about now do you still hear\nyourself yeah I can hear myself again\nwhat is it\nokay yeah so the audience did confirm it\nwas fixed\numso when you're muted\nI don't hear myself and the audience is\nnot hearing an echo\nand then you unmute yourself which means\nyour microphone is picking your voice\nbut how does it replicate mine it's\nweird\nlike I've never seen that ughum Malik says really appreciate that you\nall have that perspective\nmany just want to sell courses so let\nGwen get back and probably\nshe also has some more\num\na good opinion on this but yeah\nthe\nI think the idea when you know go and\nstarted streaming and like started\nYouTube and same for me I know we shared\nthis in the 2022\noh\nlive stream we had with day and Kev was\nthat\nfor us it's like the engineering mindset\nlike we love doing what we do we love\nworking\num like for me it's you know devops and\nCloud for Gwen it's cloud and a few\nthings of devops similar interests and\nthen they it was cyber\num and then Kev Works in it\nI hear myself again damn it\na lot of people are saying that\num ohum a lot of people are saying it's not a\nbad act it's like they can understand\nhear and understand both of us when we\nare talking\nback and forth yeah distinct though\noh it broke the bottom of thesorry the poster thing fell in it like\nchipped the thing there was a security\ndeposit\nit's a displayed right so it's like\nmetallic yeah yeah that's why\nI'll leave it open it's too hightoo how's my girlfriend\nChanning she wants to talk on the phone\nbut she doesn't want to be heard on\nstream like they're not gonna hear you\nyeah\nwe could barely hear the\ndisplayed falling\noh really it was not too loud so yeah oh\nmy goodness this thing is amazing if I\nfigure out why it's routing your voice\nto the main thing\nlet me seeyeah\nso yeah Malik\num that being said you know we are\nalways love creating\nuh good Cloud Solutions good devops\nSolutions\nyeah I don't hear myself you're good now\nyeah I'm goodyeah now we'll see uh some comments in\nthe chat we should at least but yeah\nthat'll be sad yeah we don't we don't\nhave the goal to sell courses and that's\nwhy I learned Cloud exists that's why\nit's open source that's why it's free\nthat's why it's Community Driven and all\nof the other stuff that we have been\nadvocating for and it's gonna stay that\nwayokay I think we're good now I just said\nyou're it was it was routing your the\nthe PC audio to the main channel so\nthat's why oh so we're good now I got\nthis really fancy it's called a rode Pro\nCaster uh and it's what gives amazing\nquality to this thing but it's also like\nit's way more complex than what I'm used\nto so I'm still trying to understand how\neverything works on it but it has cool\neffects which is how I did that thingy\nokay cool let's see South America let's\ngo yeah I am\nwhen I lived in Ecuador I saw that there\nwas a lot of\nuh Microsoft presence in terms of like\ntech there so I have a feeling like\nhaving\num something like it AWS based or Azure\nbased company\nthat would Implement that kind of stuff\nwould be\nuh\nyeah lucrative and have lots of\nopportunitiesokay all these are echo echo echo I\nthink Owen's room is haunted oh my\ngoodness I'm like I'm more upset that\nthe thing chipped I wish I could show\nyou guys but it chipped the you know how\nthe bottom of the walls have I don't\nknow what this called\noh I see yeah like it's like a wood\ndetail or something like that yeah like\na slab thing like a long slab\nshipped it so now I'm sure like when I\nmove out of here\nit's gonna I had I had a similar thing I\nhad a it was not a displayed but it was\nlike a Ronaldo's uh wooden like it was\npainted on a wooden piece\num\nyeah and my brother had it behind the\nmonitor like on the monitor resting on\nthe monitor it fell down broke the same\nthing in my apartment I'll send you a\npicture like it chipped it yeah really\nbad yeahum bad moments\nI'm telling you\nit's the layoff energyyep\npower voice carries inevitable power\nvoice carries and inevitable I don't\nunderstand that\nhow's the back end project for learning\ncloud coming from my iPhone yeah let's\nsee how much learning cloud costs let me\nbring up the portalumso let's move this over here\nto go to all right sopresent\nyour screen share screen is your screen\nall right\nuh hiking comment all right cool\nso last 24 hours we've had oh no this is\nlast five minutes 700 787 sight hits\nlet's take a look I always like to look\nthe last let's do this last seven days\ncool oh I'm also pulling up like actual\nvisitor data\nwe've had 141\n000 sight hits maybe we can have more\nlike last 30 days because we've been\nlive for like\ntwo 200 800 no 283 900.\nsite hits okay so that's just you get a\nfeel of kind of for the traffic but\nwe'll have actually visitor data when we\nshould pull set up\nuh learn a clown\nis\nI feel like because we had that second\nAzure static web app for like a like a\nday or so like it might have given like\nthrown off our estimates but\nit's totally fine let's seeI I was uh saying that we were gonna hit\nlike 30 a month but I think we're\nalready our forecast is already\npassing yeah our forecast is 38 dollars\nI was going to say 48 oh my goodness I\nsaid 15 yeah you did say 50. so we're\nprobably we're gonna go above that but\nyou're right that we added a second\nstatic web app did you clean that up\nlike did you delete it or no yeah yeah\nyeah yeah okay cool\noh no do look our grafana what VM are we\nusing we are using a B2 it's a small one\nit's not it's supposed to turn it off\nno we should use container apps\nyeah yeah insteadoh\noh did I turn it off I'll I'll take a\nlook let's look because it's like\nalready we've had that for like what\nless than a week like a couple of days\nit's already a couple of days yeah\ncompared to\nyeah\nokay that's see\nyeah Richard what the heck let's look at\nthatumyeah it's on the top favor hit a like\nhit a like on that stream so we can hit\n100 people watching\nB2 I that's on rishab\nI'm firing you right now\nbut hey I was using it almost daily I\nwas trying to figure out how to get yeah\nI was trying to figure out how to get\nthe\nlike the Azure stuff but they also have\na plug-in for Google analytics now so\nlike we were like this was a solution\nlike everything would be solved because\nwe can have Azure app insights and like\nthe cost Monitor and also we could have\nthe Google analytics that we use for you\nknow user stuff\nbut yes it's a three dollar one can we\ndo this one no no it's fine it's fine\nwe'll I'll create a container and we'll\nuse container apps yeah yeah\num because you know we here we are all\nabout Cloud native\nif I want to run the grafana I could run\nit on Raspberry Pi which would be a cool\nproject butcool so then that's going to save us\nsome money there yeah look at us\nstay in that fifty dollars\nokay so I have last seven days of data\nwe had two point\n4K userswhich is\n68 percent more traffic\ncompared to any other seven days in the\nlast year\nso that how that's how the percentage\nCompares 2.7 K in the last seven days\nyesand I'll tell you last 28 is which means\nlike since we\nwhen did we go live January 9th\nuh but I guess the Google analytics we\nturned it on on so that was a couple\ndays after\na week after January 13th so\nJanuary 13 to January 19th yeah\nthat is the last seven days the last\nseven days two point oh my goodness\nwe're like a successful small startup\nexcept we don't make any money\nyeah\n4.3k sessions\ndamn we have nine people that are on\nlearn to Cloud right now all organic\ntraffic people no ads no marketing I\nmean I guess social media kind of counts\nmarketing but the fact that this thing\nstill gets this much traffic a year over\na year\nsince lunch\nbut well we can say organic marketing\nlike we haven't run ads on Twitter we\nhaven't run ads on YouTube right\num correct correct correct okay we are\nusing our personal brandsyeah I mean I guess that shows like if\nsomeone want to task like what's the\npower of your personal brand you could\njust show show these kind of metrics\nright because you know there's like\npeople out there there's influence out\nthere with like millions in audience and\nthen they can't sell like 15 t-shirts oh\nyeah yeah like so\num a few of you may know that I want the\ndeveloper 30 and the 30 world right\nyeah I forgot you you won that\ndoors like they they look at public\ncontributions\nwhat are my public contributions\n95 of them were to learn to Cloud\nso they looked over into Cloud they're\nlike oh this is free so like I feel like\nlearn to Cloud played a huge role in me\nwinning that award\num because they look at\nthe free stuff you do for the community\nlike that award specifically looks at\nthe free stuff that you do for students\nfor community\nkind of thing so\nyeah like from personal Brands\nperspective yeah like it it is a really\ngood\nlike we have great numbers\nwhich comes from the value that it\nprovides\nyeah\nlike\nall these vanity metrics like retweets\nand likes and stuff like that I don't\nreally mean much in my opinion\nyeah and like someone who said if we\nthink\nlike if learn to cloud or like if Gwen\nand I get laid off and we still want to\nkeep this runningI think\nlike I I don't know I'm just gonna put\nthis out let me know what you think what\nwe would have banner ads\nprobably something like that two\ngenerator revenue and it will generate a\nlot of Revenue yeah at least much that\ncould cover our hosting costs\nbecause of the amount of traffic we haveyeah if um\nwe have a road map for issues and stuff\nthat we're implementing so for example\ncreate status dashboard\nuh create API that will show Cloud\ndefinition on the home page enable app\ninsights Implement search feature oh we\ngot the configuration for this by the\nway so we should get on this\noh we did yeah we got the email with all\nthe details that we need for this cool\noh yeah approved\num Hospital Azure with dashboard with\nmonitoring metrics implement this is\ndone isn't this\nyes\nall right we forgot to move this over oh\nbecause we were having issues with\nmerging to the main thing that was weird\nOkay cool so that's done\nwe're probably we we have a weekly stand\nup where we add or remove to this uh and\nthen we we put this on the home page in\ncase anyone wants to get some Hands-On\nCloud experience like in production this\nisn't like some tutorial or some course\nyou're actually going to build something\nthat and we have it in a way that as\nsoon as you\nyou know you'd have your PR you submit\nit we can generate a URL for you to\nactually see it live it's not going to\nbe like learn a cloud.guy but it's going\nto be like a like a staging like so you\ncan actually see your contributions\nin real life so if anyone wants to work\non anything that we have here you just\ncan't you know go into your GitHub\naccount go to the link of our backlog\nand then comment hey I want to work on\nthis I know someone had mentioned they\nwant to work on which one is it this one\nthe status dashboard no no no\num the other one\nno it's this one these are\noh I almost work on this one and then\nsomeone Works to work on what works on\nthe search one the search feature I'm\npretty sure we could find someone who\nwould want to work on this one too app\ninsights because it's all JavaScript\nstuff\nyeah\num for me the focus was the dev\ncontainer\nso I have a branch oh\nsum it up here\num Dev container support so oh sorry\nGitHub code spaces support so that\npeople can they don't have to worry\nabout\ngonna see I don't see an issue in here\nfor that I'll create one\ndamn it rishab itI need this I need this now we need\ntickets for all this stuff you know yeah\nso that we talked about it and you're\nlike\nso these are the tickets that I have oh\nI'm like okay you're still here yeah\nthese are the tickets we have this is\nwhat we are welcome we are going to work\non then we were towards the end of the\ncall we were like oh by the way the dev\ncontainer stuff is like old and we would\nhave to support you know docusarus\ninstead of doxify\noh and that reminds me since I mentioned\ndocs I'm gonna create a ticket because I\nwill forget we have to clean up doxify\nBranch it's still running on GitHub\nPages for no reasonI'm gonna do that yeah add that ticket\nand add the the dev container.json which\nis what enables code spaces yes yeah add\nthat too and I'm gonna go through some\nof these questions here the baseboard I\ngot some Frosted Flakes y'all\nthat's my girlfriend's favorite cereal\nFrosted Flakes\nis Linux Survivor a good program to\nlearn Linux on I just went through basic\ncommands and file name structures and\nnow I'm on Linux security it seems\nintuitive and very easy to like I don't\nthink I've ever heard of Linux Survivor\nit's pretty good all right\num Kev I think I heard it from Kev\nTech yeah yeah shout out kevtech it's\nit's pretty good I recommended it to my\nbrother-in-law because he was he's\npreparing for Linux Essentials and he's\nnot\num like he needed some practice with\nlike actual uh command line\nterminal like he has installed stuff but\nhe needed some challenges like a gaming\nlike gamified method to learn command\nline so Linux Survivor is pretty good\nnice\nI also plug myself I have a bash for\nbeginners course coming out soon in the\nnext couple of weeks we wrapped up\nrecording yesterday\nuh editing is in the works I gotta do\nall the the marketing I gotta write a\nblog post got to put in all the metadata\nall that kind of stuff but you know\nthat's halfway done so\nuh that'll be out soon we're covering oh\nwe're covering a lot we're covering\npermissions recovering setting up your\nenvironment we're covering Loops\nfunctions uh variables what is your bash\nscript uh what else did I do oh my\ngoodness case statements conditional\nstatements redirection Pipelines\nviewing files making files making\nfolders and there's a bunch of stuff\nthere so\nbe sure to check that out that'll be on\nYouTube uh free for all\nin a couple of days not a couple days a\ncouple of weeks I'll if you if you\nfollow me on YouTube I always Post in\nthe community my community tab updates\nto that because everyone seems to be\nexcited for that onehappy hey gangs everyone what up Daryl\nhow you doing\nlook at that smash that like if you\nhaven't please smash that like button do\nit for a bit bit is the Azure advocacy\nmascots\nhe's\nhe's pretty cool I think he's one of the\ncoolest mascots\nwe got these plushies here and even the\ntag says\nthe tag is custom Microsoft Azure tag\nattention to detail yeah it's like the I\nlike the oh also the backpack the back\nthereum where's your beep the beep featurethere we goyeah so yeah hit that like button\nthanks for the stream Lucas said how\nyeah you're quick with that\nI couldn't even find that if I had to\ncomment it\num that's that's good I have the the\nYouTube window open on the right hand\nside and you you know\nso I'm mod for Gwen's chat and I'm like\nit popped up it's saying oh the message\nis held for review because it contains\nsomething something I'm like what and\nthen I click on show\nthat was quick that was quick\nokay so I have the one issue in\ncreating the second one\nuh and get startedit's a really good unorganized page that\nit's impossible not to share with your\nfriends who also want to learn about\ncloud services thank you I appreciate\nthatreally do I\nto be honest I don't really remember\nputting it together\nbecause it was kind of a blur because I\njust tweeted it out and then I was like\nokay now I have to make it and then over\nthe next two days I was just like\nnon-stop wrote it\nbut it's definitely evolved since thenbut we did put a lot of work into the\norganization so it's like a neat\nprogression as you go through it\nso thank you for that feedback\nsmash that like if you haven't alreadyupdate Dev containerto supportdocusauruscool coolthat's a long-term goal of mine to learn\nnow and one day be able to give back as\nyou both do give back at any stage that\nyou're at I would say\nI really I regret and I regret because I\ndidn't know about it but\nif I could have gone like helped us days\nand started documenting my journey then\nthat would be the coolest stuff I think\nthat's the only regret like if close to\nregret is like\nstarting that process sooner than later\nthat would have been so cool to just\nhave like my first help desk gig and\nthen now then like like eight like a\nyear ago joining Microsoft I think that\nwould be really freaking cool to see\nthat progression but\nI kind of started to like halfway\nthrough my I guess current career so not\nthat bad but it would have been cool to\nhave\nlike earlier earlier stuff for sure\nyeah\nRaspberry Pi exists\nare so possible to get one now it is\nimpossible they're so expensive so so\nexpensive I remember we got them for\nbulk in 2018 or 19 and I'm glad I hold\nlike a hell to one of them this was also\ngiven to me by like ECI it's a shout out\nfor paying for a Raspberry Pi\nbut we like both ordered a few of them\nand they were like thirty dollars each\nbecause it was a bull Carter and now if\nI try to get one first of all it's not\nin stock yeah if it is it's like 150 or\n200 dollars\ncrazyI remember I got one to make a video\ngame emulator at my cloud engineer got\njob because that office was pretty cool\nthey had like a projector ping pong\ntable and whatever so and on the end of\nFridays we would play it just video\ngames\nso my boss was like oh I want to play\nthe classics\nso I was like we should get a Raspberry\nPi and he was like okay get it expense\nit so I bought one I think I got one\nwith like I think the packet the whole\nproduct is called like a canary because\nit comes like with a case yeah it was\nlike a white case and like it's really\nnice\nI think that was like 40 bucks\noh something like that yeah\nbut this was 2018 so\nbig difference now\nbanner ads\nwhat up Anna\nwait this is different and I thought\nthis was\nthat this was the Anna that I knew or is\nit the Anna that I know maybe not I\nthink that's that's Anna with two ends\nbut hello Anna but she's also from\nBrazil so\nhello Anna from Brazil\noh I know who you're talking about yeah\nyeah Anna AWS Anna hey um keeping mine\ndocked for the for the win doc waitthank you my doctor for the win\nlike you're using Docker on yours\nyeah could besee what else did I\nthink one's room is hauntedI'm scared of ghosts I don't say stuff\nlike thatyou play the\nhow do you play so many zombie games\nI think I do it because\nI want to face my fears\nyeahface your fearshey y'all just wanted to know that I\njust applied some advice they gave me\nduring a liveduring a live message for Caldwell just\nstarted a software just started a role\nas a software product manager with a\ncloud Focus ah good for you\ncongratulations congratulations do we\nhave some kind of\nno claps oh come on\nI'll have to load it for the next one\num that's awesome Omar I I'm sure I've\nI've seen your name multiple times\nbefore and we we've been in I guess\nuh you've been on our streams for a\nwhile now so that's awesome\nI'm curious what advice it was because I\ncan't remember but\num that's awesome software product\nmanager with a cloud Focus\ncongratulations we're very very happy\nfor you keep us umkeep us updated with how it goes for\nsure\nyeah I think I see his face a lot on\nLinkedIn too\nand it's been like a year or more that\nI've seen\npretty active\nsnaps\nLucas Lucas H says snaps for Omar love\nit\nwhat up Ciscomany thanks what you do is important oh\nthank you some days we I want to quit\nYouTube\nso I mean all the time I want to quit\nYouTube so\nit's stuff like that that keeps me going\nI I constantly tell rishab I'm like I\ndon't really know if I want to do this\nanymore\nso I I have those days\nlately I've been having it a lot more\nbut\nthank you I appreciate it\nuh what else okay on Raspberry Pi three\nso I was replying while you guys were\ndiscussing piottagespeaking about pies\nthere's this Organic Market\nthat sells the most delicious\napple pies I've ever had oh okay and\nthey have\nand they're there every Saturday morning\nI was just telling Gigi this I'm like oh\nmy gosh we have to go tomorrow to get a\npiece of that pie because so good with\nsome coffee oh my God\nit's so freaking good\nI I keep coming back to this because\nthis is amazing this is amazinghere's a question for you if land to\nCloud had a mascot what animal it would\nbe\na robot that's not an animal though\nit has to be an animal oh my goodness\nfor real\ndon't say crocodile\nno I want to say something like a wolf\nmm-hmm can it be a dinosaur\nit can't be a dinosaur they existed\nright so that counts yeah yeah yeah\ndinosaur Maybe\nlike a T-Rex so badass\nI'm wearing like a hoodie with yeah\nCloud would be nice\nuh yeah oh someone said an eagle\nit's called a cloud barfing a rainbow I\nfeel like someone has that as like yeah\nI've seen the sticker somewhere like it\nreminds me of a sticker that has like a\nSilver Cloud and like rainbow coming out\nand like the the\nyeah super shiny eyes\nbarfing rainbow I've seen that\nyeah yeah apple versus pecan\nApple\nall day I'm like a such a classics\nClassics type person\nhere's the question rishab do you do you\never drink soda\nyeah so Coke or Pepsi\nit's a million dollar question\nyoucan I go out of the way and say a thumbs\nuphave you have you ever had thumbs up the\nthe drink the the drink thumbs up\nyeah it's a it's a really close to Coke\nand Pepsi but we used to have that in\nIndia it looks like Pepsi though it\nlooks more like maybe because of The\nBranding yeahum I'll say I'll say Coke yeah you're\ndone\nforeignyeah just like blocking you I'll block\nyour number yeah I'll remove you from\nthe GitHub repo and yeah made a pull\nrequest resha was removed because he\nloves Cokeyeah there's a right wrong and the\nanswer to this pecans are classic like\nCoke okay so okay I I would agree\nbut there was I just I watched this\ndocumentary on Netflix that was like all\nabout how Pepsi and the like I think 80s\nor 90s they said that you could win a\njet\noh yeah yeah the documentary is the\nwhere's my million dollar jet yeah\nsomething like that where is my jet\nPepsi something yeah yeah\noh my gosh someone says nobody drinks\nPepsi that's a lie it's a lie I it's a\nlie I don't drink soda often but when I\ndo it's either Pepsi or\num Seven Up\noh that's a good one\ndude begins dwarfs no\nno no this is\nthis is not oh someone asked a good\nquestion here how do you guys make your\ncoffee and how many cups do you go\nthrough in a work day one I drink it\nblack with a little bit of sugar\nand restaurant is a monster so he just\ndrinks it black with nothing see now I\nneed that effect that rishab drinks\nblack coffee like really deep voice but\nyes\num I used to drink\nI I think you know this but I used to\ndrink like two or three cups yeah in the\nday\nuh in like nine hours of my day\nand I have dialed it down to like just\none cup in the morning and that's it\num and I yeah I usually I got this new\nmachine\nlike the Nespresso something it makes a\nreally good coffee\nuh but yeah no sugar no cream I can't I\ndon't think I can handle cream because\nit gets like\nI feel full\nthe beginning of the day and I can't do\nthat like it I don't knowwhen people say pecan instead of instead\nof pecan pecan big secret who the hell\nsays pecanNoah says pecan\npecan\npecan\nI don't think I've ever heard that\nAeropress see sometimes I'm like I want\nto get super fancy with my coffee but\nthen I'm like I don't have the time for\nthis I also drink one cup that I barely\nfinish\nthat's true I like I'll sip it through\nthe morning and then once it's like four\no'clock I don't allow myself to have\nanything with caffeine because if I do I\ncan't sleep so\nthen I just like if it's there I just\nhave to like put it away or something or\nyou save it and then the next morning\nyou can make iced coffee\nyeah the only reason I got that machine\nis\nI'm gonna be honest here like\nif if people say I'm cheap that's fine\nuh the Black Friday event was on the\ncoffee machine usually goes for like 180\ndollars and with taxes it's 200 and like\nI'm never getting a coffee machine\nthat's 200 but then I saw people getting\n800 worth of machine so I'm like okay\nthis is justifiable because I love\ncoffee and I want to make it at home but\nI'm going down this Rabbit Hole so like\nbear with me\num the Black Friday deal they said the\nmachine is for sixty dollars plus you\ngetum you get like 50 capsules free for\nthat machine nice I'm like this is a\nsteal\nso I bought it right off the bat yeah\nyou can and they also gave me a frother\nto\nfraud the cream which I don't drink so\nit's just sitting there collecting dust\nbut the coffee machine is being used so\nthat's great\nso it's one capsule per cup\nyeah\nokayI feel like that's a good deal it is\ncould do if I'll do for years and you're\ndisappointing me more and more in the\nStream let's go more hot takes Coke\nsucks\nif you canum\nwhat's another really hot take\ntabs versus speciesuh\nuh now now I will end the end the\nFriendship here let's see no no I don't\nhave a preference it's whatever the\nconvention is for the language because\nit's like some language what is the\nconvention on learn to clouds code okay\nthere you go we have a lot of yamlers we\nhave yaml isn't that spaces\nare you sure isn't yamo like four spaces\nor something like that so you could use\nTaps right because you're saving\nclicking the spaces four times\nbut what it because languages have like\noh you're supposed like they're they're\nbest practices\nno no usually not yeah it doesn't pythonlike I have my own preference I don't\nknow what people use\nuh Max or better than PC no ew what I\nuse I use whatever I use text yeah yeah\nI used tabs I used tabs yeah I just do\nCtrl shift p and I do format and then\nwhatever it puts it at that's what I use\nyou can change that too to be honest\nwhatever the default is yeah\nsafe answers Glenn I need a hot take\nfrom you never mind HTML is not a\nprogramming language that's a hot take\nthat's like the the generic Twitter HOT\ntake\nwhy though\nuh question is why no no I don't think\nso I'm just joking I don't really care I\nnever really thought about it to be\nhonest yeah I have not but then I\nrealized when I was in high school it\nwas considered like not considered but\nif you tell like what are some electives\nyou are taking it came under\ncomputer programming yeah so like if\nit's not a programming language like why\nare you even learning it like in that\ncurriculum is what I'm trying to say so\nif the education system thinks that\nlike\nwho are you the question\nyeah but Twitter is a different you know\nworld uh so\nsomeone's gonna claimed thatcome at metry to cancel me\nMountain Dew switch let me hold on I'll\nbe right back I'm just gonna switch this\ndesk down\nkeep answering your thoughts on Mountain\nDew\nyou can see\nyeah we can still hear you\nit's a good it's a good soda\nwon't lie\num but yeah it's not the one that I pick\nI don't know why\nlike if I'm given a choice I don't pick\nMountainum but if I'm given wanting you I won't\nsay no\nif that makes sense\nthis is the cloud God\nforeignis here what's up love it sounds like a\nlike a Tony Hawk combo\nyeah I was gonna say it sounds like a\nAzure certification but\nI just took the no skills 900\n[Laughter]\nthere's a hot take no\num Mac only has the terminal going for\nit\nthere you go Rodney I don't know but now\nwith WSL like what's the what's the\nanswer there\nsee\nyou won't get like a hot debate out of\nme and Gwen because we have Windows\nusers\nreally good custom PCS and I know Rodney\nyou're also a custom PC person\nso like don't start this debate here but\nwe do also have personal Max so like for\nlaptops or portable systems we do have\nM1 Max and we are completely happy with\nthem\num so yeah whatever works for us we try\nto use it to our advantage to be fair I\ndon't use it often that often\nlike I might use it like once yeah yeah\nit's more for like you know if you're\nout and you're staying somewhere else\nfor like longer period and you need a\npersonal system I love this this setup\nthat I have here like custom PC cam 4k\nmonitor other monitor mic like this is\njust perfect for me when I work off a\nlaptop I just find like I don't know\nwhat to do with the display of the\nlaptop\nbecause if I close it then I feel like\nI'm wasting the retina display that the\nMac has if I open it it's this is such a\nfirst world issue and I hate myself for\nsaying this but it's just true if I open\nit and I'm like oh I'm just trying to\nfocus on looking at the screen but it's\nso darn small\nso\nI just like PC setups better\num\nthe only thing I like about the Mac is\nyou can program App application that's\nso true\nnow to do there's no way to build Mac or\niOS apps at least that I know of yeah\nyou need a you need a Mac machine to\nbuild\nthe entire directory structure of how\nyou submit and stuff which is weird\nMr Muffin that's a cool name I wish PCS\nwere able to do that somehow yeahis the command line code\num no it's\nlike every operating system have their\nown kind of version of command line it's\na cool hacky thing that you see in\nmovies and documentaries like black\nscreen white texts and Landscaping green\ntext and someone's like oh what are they\ndoing they're like oh I'm hacking into\nthe system so command line is uh it's a\ntext-based program that allows you to\nyou know run some kind of actions or\ninteract with a machine or like for\nexample\nyou know when you work with AWS you have\nthe Azure command line when you work\nwith m i mean when you work with AWS you\nhave the AWS command line Azure Azure\ncommand line Docker a bunch of programs\nhave command lines\num\nso it's not necessarily\na language or anything itself it's just\na text-based program\nthen the\ndepending on how like what the Oink the\ncommand line is usually\num\nabbreviated by CLI\nuh and then depending on how your CLI\nworks like you'll have to have different\ncommands like you know different\nfunctionality\num but the majority of clis if not all\nof them\nintegrate very well with bash which is a\nshell and also a language and\nessentially a universal language when it\ncomes to working with servers because\nthe majority of the cloud runs on Linux\nand the like a lot like I don't even\nknow the percentage but of the majority\nof Linux servers will allow you to use a\nBash\nso yeah that's that's I think someone\nasked us about hold on\noh my goodness yeah so that's what the\nCLI is\ndo you think like technically else would\nhave happened if you didn't fire anyone\nyes\nguys what programming language would you\nrecommend to get into devops python yaml\nthis is Richard's Channel now yes it is\nRichard's Channeluh you say you wanna you want to quit\nYouTube but lately I've seen a lot of\nGPS content via YouTube we do appreciate\nit\nthe more I make content it's because the\nmore I want to quit so the more I'm\nconvincing myself to not quit by making\nmore there's a little tidbit\nlaughs\nstart with bash follow them yeah\neveryone needs to know the baby oh yeah\nthat's it that's it don't argue with me\nRichard\nCloud the cloud gods have spoken\nchange the voice\nyou must learn bash to become one with\nthe cloud\nthere we go\nI have said this so many times that I\nwas so fortunate my college diploma had\nLinux and advanced Linux as a course\nbecause when I entered help desk like I\nwas people would think I was so smartand type in the name of the directory\nnot only that like I was really\ncomfortable with grip and stuff and like\nI remember some yeah some Engineers\nseeing me like going through log files\nusing grep and they're like oh you know\ngrab and I'm like yeah\num so yep it's like it's a cheap like it\nit really helps and if you try to avoid\nit\nI'm gonna say this you you will have to\ncome back and learn it um yeah you\ndefinitely will I today Caroline tweeted\nsomething like you don't need to know\nLinux to get into Thai tea you don't\nneed to know Linux to get into\nthis admin and etc etc and I was trying\nto understand her point of view I think\na lot of people when they say like you\nshould learn Linux they just mean that\nyou shouldn't know how to use a command\nline\nand it's one of those things like if\nyou're a beginner\num\nbecoming comfortable with the command\nline is like super important but it's\nmore so like oh which one do you learn\nlike you could do like command prompt\nPowershell uh or bash but ultimately\nbash is just more popular so that's why\nI recommend people learn it and nowadays\nyou know with Windows having WSL and and\nlike all these Cloud platforms having\nCLI it's like I just really don't see\nwhy someone wouldn't want to learn it soWSL is great as well different\nstokes-stricken folks yeah\nyeah that's what we use\num\nfor like the windows term in the lab\nwhere can you find your bash course\nwhich you recently finished when did I\nsay that I finished this course tell me\nthis is what like gets to me sometimes\nwhen I say I give people constant\nupdates let's yesterday I literally\nposted\nI finished recording and it's off to\nediting so where did I say where did\nthis misinformation come from\nbut anyway the recording is done it's on\nto the editor so it's going to take a\nfew I don't know maybe like two weeks or\nso and then we'll figure out\na launch day around the time\nlearn get up get ups for Bash what the\nheck is get Ops for bash it will help\nwith structuring your codeyou mean GitHub sorry get UPS like get\nUPS is a thing like GI g-i-t get UPS\noh no\num get ops command in Linux with\nexamples\nit's a very convenient best scripting\nutility which helps you to conveniently\nand gracefully handle the passing of\nflags an argument in a clean\nstandardized manner instead of having\nthe developer manually handle the flags\npassed to a script this provides a handy\nway of handling this when iterating\nthrough a while loop\ninteresting well get Ops\nI mean no colon the dolet go check if how do I andah poor hosting okay interestingway\nyeah I've never heard of this no same\nhere\ngood to know yeah good to know I've\nheard of get UPS yeah that's that's why\nI was like get UPS\napps warp terminal on Mac is the only\nthing I'm jealous of I've never heard of\nthat either yeah I've heard about it but\njust on\nlike social media[Music]\nI see CLI commands I have a whole\nsession on that on my channel I don't\nknow if it's on my channel but you can\nfind it yeah it is\nuh using yeah how to become proficient\nwith the Azure CLI in bash something\nlike that it's on my channel you can\nfind it I did a whole hour session on\nthat\nhow much of a role does intelligent play\nin a high position that you guys are in\nor do you believe anyone can do it I'm\nnot in a high positionthe audience expecting that you're gonna\nsay I'm not intelligent\nno I'm intelligent I'm not in a high\npositionI feel like a lot of people like to\ndownplay and say like oh yeah yeah you\ncan\nyou don't have to uh study you don't\nhave to be super smart you don't have to\nbe like you know I like I'm like dumb as\nrocks and I can do this no\nyou have to have a skill set an ability\nfor sure definitely\nbut you don't have to be a genius\nbut it's not like people go and throw\nrocks at like some random person but\nlike okay you can come be in this role\nlike it's not that's not the reality\neither but you don't you don't have to\nbe you know you don't need a PhD for\nthis stuff either definitely not\nuh how much does all intelligence play\nin a hype job position that you guys are\nin or do you believe anyone can do it\nI believe anyone can do it but not a lot\nof people have the\nI guess I don't know what it takes to\nlike face the amount of rejection that\nit takes to get into like\num\nlike a tech role not even just in like\nbig Tech just like get a tech role in\ngeneral you because it's so competitive\nlike you're gonna have to go through a\nbunch of a bunch of rejections sometimes\npeople can't do it I think there's a lot\nmore of like people skills that go into\nlanding a role like resiliency patience\nyeah um how emotionally mature you can\nhandle yourself in like with rejection\nand interviewing and stuff like that so\ncan every can anyone do that sure can\neveryone do it probably not\num but if if you're willing to put\nyourself through it then I can see yeahuh\nwould you define Bash\nI think I just did right yeah\ny'all got to have me on here come on\ncome on right now let me\nhow do I send you a link are you on\nDiscord\nuh yeah or you want to learn to Cloud\nDiscord if you want to learn to Cloud\nDiscord I'll send you a link right now\nand come on you just one you need to\nmake sure you have decent audio and\nCamera uh two you need to make sure\nyou're not going to be disrespectful and\ncome on here with like conspiracy\ntheories or anything like that\nuh that's pretty much it so if you're on\na Discord\ndo you like at register at maybe a GPS\nhey I'm here tell me the link and I'll\nsend you a link\nand that goes for anyone who wants to\ncome on\nI I all the time I offer people come on\nstream it doesn't really matter to me\nto become a devops engineer to be\ncomfortable not knowing everything\ninstead of being an engineer become a t\noh and I have engineer yes yes yes yes\nso that's why we love help desk help\ndesk lets you develop like this high\nrange of like a bunch of random skills\nand then you figure out which one you\nlike the most and you go deeper in that\nbut you carry all these like like\nlike there's a wide range of skills and\nyou have you keep like upskilling in\nthem upskilling upskilling whatever but\nyou're you're proficient in one thing\nbut you're very aware of the other thing\nthe other day someone was saying like is\nit important for web developers to know\nCloud I would say yes because ultimately\nyour stuff ends up being deployed in the\ncloud\nand then you are aware of it right yepuh hi from San Francisco to use for\ntechnical illustrations I use escalidraw\nyep same tools I used to use draw.io a\nlot\num in my cloud engineering gig and I\nalso realized like there was a python\npack you could use to\num draw\ntechnical illustrations which was really\nimpressive\nbut yeah excally draw for like anything\nthat you see on learn to cloud or on our\nstreams or videosthat question or phrase that dude what\nquestion is this did I miss something\nI'm not looking at the YouTube I'm just\nlooking at the story mode so\num if you go to learn to Cloud dot guide\non the top right you can hit Discord and\nthat should take us to your Discord I\nmean take\nyou to our Discord yeah what question is\nthatum\nlet us know is I think it's the one that\nyou need to be intelligent to be in the\nhigh okay so here we go you did say that\nyou have 180k salary when you have a\nvideos yeah\nuh I live in Canada oh okay okay so high\npaying position\nokay I thought you meant like seniority\nlike are you loving yeah you know I'm\nlevel 62 at Microsoft so that's\ntechnically not\num\nlike the highest level that you can get\nto I don't really know what the highest\nlevel is obviously CEO but I'm talking\nmore about like and individually\nindividual contributor I see that they\ncall ituh so yeah\nthis is your cousin right yepthis is when we need to get a VPN\nsponsor so we could be like and nordvpn\nyeah I use a VPN service I'm not gonna\nname it until I get to sponsor our\nstream\nsmart uh okay so this is you did say you\nhave a 180 salary one of your old videos\nI remember correctly I live in Canada so\nthat's considered a high position here\nokay\nwhich part of Canada sorry yeah I'm\ncurious I'm from Canada too so no um\nthat's why I'm curiousI'll say it\nwe got let me send this invite over\nto this personI swear if you come on here talking\ncrazyI'll kick you out with the god Boy sign\nOttawa okay\nso yeah I'm based out of I don't know Mr\nMuffin if you're familiar with like\num but I am often on Gwen's Channel Mr\nMuffin I\nI was so serious you've hit me now\nit's so professionally like\nyou know Mr Muffin I gotta tell you\noh\nno offense\num yeah but Mr Muffin\nI can't say it with a straight faceum yeah I'm in Kitchener Waterloo and\nlike around GTA area and like I've\ntalked to a few folks and like I think\nthe average kind of salary and I could\nbe wrong like let me know\num the average salaryis\n150 150 to 1580k or 190k in some cases\nfor a medium\num level engineer\nand this is in Canadian dollars\num so like 150 190 is the sweet spot for\nfive year four to five years of\nexperience working in let's say we're\ntalking about Cloud Engineers like\nthat's a medium level cloud engineer who\nhas four to five years of experience I\nbelieve\num\nbut yeah\nI do know that Ottawa has\npretty low salaries I do know that damn\nI did some research yeah\nis is\nOttawa like a city or what it's a it's\nthe capital\nof what Canada\nso it's a city\nit's a city yeah I thought Toronto was\nthe capital what no Toronto is not the\ncapital\notherwise where all the government stuff\nis\num otherwise where the parliament is uh\nDC yeah yeah\nso so a lot of government jobs but that\nalso means a lot of\nless pain\nmakes sense makes sense why an average\nwould be lower there\nuh all right so do you need to be\nintelligent to get a high paying job\nI think it's 50 50. I definitely do\nthink it's 50 well no no so 50 50 skill\nset and then 50 like people skills but\nthat also involves luck there's a lot of\nluck to Landing a lot of being at the\nright place at the right time a lot of a\nlot of knowing the right people like\nthat like there's there'slook at this Toronto's the budget New\nYork\nit is not anymore it's so expensive I\nget it New York is expensive but Toronto\nis also really expensive\num okay now we are getting into hot\ntakes what have you started Gwen wait\nhold on what's your take on this\nLinkedIn healthy argument what\nmany companies are expecting devops to\nwrite all day while we do I saw this\nbefore we help spread the word and clear\nup the confusion many companies are\nexpecting devops to write code what the\nheck is devops like a devops engineer\nyeah yeah\nlike many companies I saw this post many\ncompanies are like when they post or are\ninterviewing an engineer they expect you\nto write code during those interviews\nbut\num\nusually we do like scripts and like\ngrammal and python here and there and go\ncoding is not the main focus so help\nspread the word and clear up the\nconfusion was this person\nwho I can't name because I don't know\nlike I read this post\num\nI would say coding zero percent is not\ntrue\nin devops when I was in devops\nI did wrote like I see\nmodules and if you use palumi they have\nPython sdks and that's how you write IC\nso you need to be familiar with how you\ndefine a function how you define a class\nhow to write Loop right and all of those\nfor me they come under programming I\nwon't say those are scripts right\num\nso I don't know like it's not zero\ncoding\nbut it's also not like\nI think it's the narrative is changing\nnow\num some companies are expecting you to\nat least understand what the code is\nwritten right and even if you don't\nwrite itI think it goes back to the fact that\njust rolls in Tech in general are never\nreally accurate like that's why that's\nwhy Cloud engineer everywhere is\ndifferent that's why solution architect\neverywhere is different and the\nexpectation is like\nso my issue with this statement is like\nyou this this was clearly made for\nengagement instead of actually trying to\nmake a difference because\nyou're just not going to change it\nthat's just a reality the only thing we\ncan do is\npay attention more to the descriptions\nand\nyou know not go for the world title\nitself\nyeah\nbut yeah it's just like it's because the\npeople who make the rules and just and\naren't usually not like an engineering\nteam\nit's also like the other thing right\num\nso I I was talking to my non-tech\nfriends and the idea is if you're a\nContent at a company X you'll probably\ndo same time\nso my brother is an accountant if your\naccountant a company X and if you go to\naccountant like same position at a\ncompany why it's gonna be same like it's\ngonna it's probably gonna be like pretty\nsimilar I can imagine yeah in Tech it's\nreally subjective to like each company\num yeah same thing with like doctors and\nstuff like if you're a doctor you're a\ndoctor it doesn't matter if you work at\na hospital X or it doesn't matter if you\nwork at a hospital why if you're like a\ncardiologist like you you work with hot\nright kind of thing can you imagine if a\ndoctor at another place was expected to\nalso be the dentist\nJesus is hereJesus hey\nwe pronounce it correctly that's easy\nyeah\nfirst of all don't come up here with\nsome culture theaters no no I've\nactually like I've been following your\nguys content for a good minute and uh oh\nwelcome yeah welcome\ntell us about yourself give us your\nelevator pitch oh yeah yeah oh man oh\nman\nuh let's see\num well I have a very diverse background\nso uh I was actually in the military for\nuh for a few years so I did five years\nand then three years reserve uh\ncame out went to Community College got\nan associates and the entire time I've\nbeen in technical support I was a\ntechnical support engineer for a good\nminute went and became a technical\nsupport manager and then made the the\ntransition to devops as I was actually\nwatching you guys content uh like a\nwhile ago like a long while ago and uh\nyeah but I've been a devops engineer now\nabout a year and a half or like a year\nsix months whatever but yeah wow so\nyou've been watching us for a minute if\nyou yeah\nvery cool well thank you for for being\nin the chat and hopping on I'm sure\npeople have a lot of questions about\nthat transition I get a lot of questions\nabout like hey I'm in the military what\nhow what should I do I can get this I\ncan do this and I'm always like I have\nno idea I actually have I actually help\na lot of my uh veteran friends or better\nconnections nice uh you know understand\nand navigate the whole GI Bill thing the\nloopholes uh the programs out there for\nus to get into Tech\num like what so I got out uh from active\nduty I got out 2018\nand at that time they you know there was\nprograms so I came out of the Marine\nCorps so the Marine Corps we didn't\nreally have a lot of programs to begin\nwith the Army the Air Force Navy does\num but at that time they started uh\nbringing in what is it the uh Microsoft\nsystems Academy I had a lot of friends\nthat actually went through there were\nvery successful didn't land a job at\nMicrosoft of course uh but they went on\nto work at startups uh and from this\nworking at startups they moved up like I\ncame from a startup and uh that's how I\nkind of got it into this\nvery cool what you got certs uh uh Azure\nsearch no so but I do have like asserts\noutside of like Azure so\num I have a\nlet's see I have my the the CompTIA\nTriad right so like second close a plus\nokay everybody has that one right um I\nhave my ITIL uh V4 from third I have my\nscrub Master cert uh product owner cert\num I have a cyber security cert from the\nlocal Community College I'm currently\ndoing a\nwhat is it a secure programming cert uh\nthrough local community college students\nagain it's like it's not just one class\nit's a multitude of classes that I've\nhad to take so uh for this class\ncurrently right now the last class I'm\ndoing C programming and Java so we're\ndoing a lot of security stuff\nbut the the cool thing is it's like I've\nonly been a devops engineer for for very\nlittle compared to a lot of people but\nbecause I came from a startup\num I had to learn a lot and yeah\nfortunate to have and still have uh\nsenior members on my team that have been\nguiding me since the beginning and like\nlike you've seen the tools that I've\nmentioned like I'm using tools that a\nlot of people do not know about or have\nseen yeah because we're doing a lot of\nlike cool stuff like again a lot of\nsecurity like I know a lot of devsecups\nuh secops stuff that people don't know\num you know like one one of the tools\nthat I put on there I don't know if you\nguys heard of Sops uh you can decrypt an\nencrypt in place in the pipelines in the\nautomation so that way you don't have\nsecrets or uh stuff like that in your\ncode and you're nice\nsee that's that's what I love about like\nworking at you know small medium-sized\ncompanies is if you're lucky like I know\nthere are you know horror stories too\nbut\num if you're like if your culture is\nreally good like because you set up a\nlot of things you're wearing multiple\nhats even though your rule might be just\ndevops engineer\num but that just builds like a really\ngood foundation when you want to ramp up\nand you know move somewhere bigger yeah\nin terms of uh devsecops like so on the\nin the CI builds you can do a lot of\nlike static code analysis right so I'm\nvery familiar with like sonar Cloud nice\nthere's other stuff like armor box or\nsome or armor no idea what you guys\nshould talk about so yeah and all it is\nit's it's basically it's just again uh\nstatic uh code analysis\num you know it's not going to execute\nthe code and it's been a little longer\nlike you know uh code smells and things\nlike that and you can set up things so\nthat way developers are not submitting\ncode\nuh that can cause a vulnerability or or\nyou know a misconfiguration and and\nagain you're doing the whole shifting\nleft right you're you're you're scanning\nit and it gives them feedback right away\nso that way you don't even touch it it\nautomatically pings them let them know\nlike hey hey Jesus is telling you that\nyour PR has these three code smells and\naccording to the gate that they place\nyou this cannot be submitted until you\nfix this\nyeah um I've I've heard about sonar\ncloud and like the the sdks they provide\nbecause you can just build right into\nwhether it's python they support a bunch\nof language Gwen are you familiar with\ncode ql or the GitHub I've never I've\nnever used it though so yeah one of the\ntasks that I do want to work on is have\ncode ql integrated into our pipelines in\nlearn to Cloud what it does is it's like\njust you know it scans the code that\ngets committed to any of the community\nPR's and looks for vulnerability so\nmaybe there is a\npython package that's out of date that\nhas security vulnerabilities that are\nyou know known to code ql so it'll let\nyou know that this PR cannot be merged\nbecause it has this security\nvulnerabilities which is good to have on\nan open source project right um so that\nis the idea of what sonar Cloud does it\nruns in an action yes yeah okay and then\nso that that covers like and you know if\nwe kind of switch and put on our\nsecurity hearts that covers the whole uh\ncalled uh static what is it it's like S\nI forget static code now like S C A or\nsomething like that\nwhich is dynamic application security\ntesting and I do that with uh zap and\nwhat it does it it does like some kind\nof uh\nlike uh what's the application security\ntesting while it's live so you give it a\nURL and it will throw different types of\nuh like test penetration tests you can\nget very intricate with that and you can\nput that in the CI build you put that in\nthe CD build\num\nyeah it's it's a there's a lot of Cool\nTools um I also do a lot of uh uh\ntesting so I do help put in tests and CI\nbuilds and the CD builds\nI've been dabbling with the Azure load\ntesting preview\num and it's really awesome\num you know I I actually was working\nwith a lot of the QA Engineers to see if\nthis would fit uh some of the things\nthat they wanted and I mean it was a\ngreat session we all learned a lot um\nyou could set that up by yourself but\nyou have to manage kubernetes and all\nthat and I'm pretty sure you know\none gear small devops team you don't\nwant to be managing stuff like that if\nit's a self-managed service and you can\ntrain people to do it\nthat's you know best case scenario\nbecause you put the responsibility back\non the developer\nyeah those are like some really good\nlike innovations that I've seen in like\nthe devops spaces because one of the\nchallenges we had back in 2018 19 ish is\nwe were trying to figure out how like we\nhad stating environments right but how\ndo we load test an app that has millions\nof users in production but you can't\nreplicate that at a smaller scale where\nyou're just a startup and you don't have\neven with like you know blue green or\nrolling updates it's it's hard we only\nhad like four QA engineers and they're\nlike that's four users like how do we\nload test this with the the actual\ntraffic that will hit so yeah I think\nyeah that space is gonna grow a lot like\nI've seen like sonar Cloud growing\num there's another one where\nI think it's called Pangea Pangea Cloud\num they're doing something similar\num pretty interesting\nbut yeah yeah but yeah the plans for\nGwen I think this will integrate really\nwell with\num\nthe learn to Cloud CI part where maybe\nJesus can help us out with that I just\ncreated an issue so yeah free yeah like\nI'll take a look around the Discord like\nI just never yeah yeah like most of the\ntime like a lot of the time that I like\nfollowed your guys's content when it\nfirst started like again I just wasn't I\nwas kind of busy learning how to do it\nright\ndoing the stuff and watching us I like\nthat yeah I like that yeah\nthat's the mindset but now you can help\nus yeah definitely absolutely we got\nsome questions here also first I want to\nsay shout out to Canal\nyeah I saw that hey let's go what up if\nyou're still watching\nuh I want to get your take on this here\nwhat do you think about this here any\ncompanies are expecting devops to write\ncode all day long while we do script\nautomate coding it's not the main focus\nhelp spread the word and clear up so\nthis was some LinkedIn take I don't know\nif you saw this uh no yeah I could\ndefinitely give my insight so yeah\nyou know it's it's to me it's like if\nyou have one additional skill like\nwhether it's security if you are eat\nbecause well let me backtrack so\ndevops Engineers from what I've seen we\nall were you know from all walks of life\nwe have some people who are software\nEngineers we have some people who are\nsecurity people or people like myself\nright\num that being said we all bring our own\nlike you know experiences views and and\noff the table right yeah so having\nadditional Tools in your belt makes you\nthat much better right whether you code\nor don't code if you do know how to code\nit helps because sometimes as a devops\nengineer you're presented with\nsituations where nobody knows how to\nimplement something and they bring it to\nyou right so you got to go read up on\nthe documentation is there an SDK is\nthere an API is this a custom solution\num you know I've had to write a bunch of\nserverless functions to to find\nsolutions to things that have not\nexisted so for example\num you know I'm not I've never been in\ncyber security or anything well we had\nto integrate a malar scanning tool\num you know I don't I didn't know\nanything about it but because I learned\nhow to code I went learned the SDK\nlearned the API\nfigured out how to integrate that rotor\nServices serverless function because of\nthe only solution they offered out of\nthe box for Azure was a VM and as we all\nknow VMS can be pricey so we wanted to\nuh\nso we went through serverless functions\ncontainer apps I'll get it deployed\ntrust me what language do you primarily\nuse as a devops uh so uh again bash uh\nPython and then because of the different\ntypes of apps that we support uh\nmajority are in Ruby and c-sharp and\nthen for my personal like side projects\nI I do go and then\num python for for personal what's uh\nwhat's your experience with with\nlearning Go versus python I feel like\nthose two get compared a lot\num especially in the devops space yeah\nso\nI will say\num go has really great error handling\num so I remember one of like my first\nprojects as a as like when I first\njoined the team\num you know you a lot of people write\nscripts and you know people who write\nbash right very like procedural code\nlike step one step three right but they\ndon't do error handling or anything like\nthat so when a pipeline fails you don't\nreally know what's going on so I had to\nwrite like my own little like package to\ndo error handling with go it's already\nbuilt in and that that that saves you a\nlot of time because you can check right\nthen and there at the time and place uh\nfor the error\nif um\nif someone wanted to learn devops now\nwhat would you recommend like just bash\nand python\nit oh man it just really depends on like\nthe industry and your company right like\nthat's just my experience right like\ngiving the people that I have I've had\non my team and and what we do but uh you\nknow for there yeah I would be I would\nsay bash and python\num\nand and you know with with bash you can\nthat there's more things that you can\nlearn in bash that are open to make you\nlook more better devops engineer right\nlike those those tools that I would\nsuggesting yeah\nget Ops JQ or yeah dot JQ\nwhich is a uh uh like a pattern\nreplacement\nuh tool that you can use and you can use\nthat a lot like it accepts yaml Json do\na lot of stuff like that so just\nlearning bash and python to start off\nand then you can go off from there\num and with python the one thing you\nknow if if like say already somebody\nalready knew how to code with python I\nwould recommend\nlearning how to create serverless\nfunctions\ngood take\nbecause yeah you become that much better\nbecause now you can build Solutions in\nthe cloud for your team and because your\ndevops engineer you're going to build\nthe whole CI pipeline the whole CD\npipeline The Continuous you know\nprocess of all that so you can continue\nto update it and then you can just pass\nthat back on to the engineers\nI've got a question for you how was the\nlearning curve going from the knowledge\nyou had in bash and python to go like I\nknow it's just a\nit's just not the syntax thing because\nit's it's different on how it handles\ncertain things yeah\num\nI mean I'm\nI'm a very big believer because again I\ndon't have a bachelor's degree I don't\nknow I don't have a masters like you\nknow a fancy University or anything\nright but yeah I'm a big believer in\nYouTube University you know what I mean\nyou know things like that so my learning\ncurve wasn't that great like you know\nsteep or you know or however that goes\nright I went on udemy I purchased the\ncourse\nburn through the course and again like\nas you start to learn how to program\nyou you learn the structure of\nprogramming right every language is\ngoing to have different syntax and\nyou know it just really depends on how\nbad you want it I mean I've burned\nthrough that course like in a week\nbecause I was like all right I'm trying\nto build a solution and because I've\ncode I've you know I've coded and see\nit was pretty quick per se you know the\nsyntax is pretty similar right but good\nis your skill set with cyeah proficient\num but but again it's just I I see the\npatterns in the in the programming\nlanguages it's just learning the syntax\nreally so I can context switch pretty\nquickly like I've like this week that's\nimpressive Ruby stuff never touched Ruby\nbefore see Ruby go Python's yeah\nimpressive skill set there like but that\nis that is the the trade-off there is uh\nand and this is what I I struggle with\nat times is like\nyou know the phrase uh what is it uh\njack of all trades or what is no not\nthat one yeah\nthe Jack of all trades master of none\nmaster of none but still better than a\nmaster of one yeah facts people forget\nthat last part and the people forget\nthat last part right\nand and you know again my I'm you know\nvery t-shaped type of person where I\nI've dabbled a little bit here and there\nwhere I can you know learn some stuff\npick it up run with it right\nbut the thing that that people like that\nlike myself struggle with is that we're\nnot very in-depth in in into one\nspecific language so like if they talk\nto me about like you know threading in\nPython\num I probably have to go learn it I'll\npick it up but like I'm not too just\nasked chat chat gbt right yeah someone\nasked uh this is a good question here\nthe last part here your your ideal\nasserts pathway for cloud devops let's\njust say devops because cloud devops is\ndifferent there so if someone wanted to\ncome in and upskill in devops do you\nhave any search that you recommend\numI mean if if they have no knowledge of\nof devops I mean certs can definitely\nhelp and in my in my experience it's\nlike certs can get you you know based\nknowledge but they're not a really good\nlike indicator of how successful you're\ngoing to be it's really their HR filters\nlike they're it's just\na really good way to put it like what's\nwhat's gonna get you like in the door\nyour foot in the door are your projects\ncan can you speak to you know\nwhat a CI pipeline is like what what is\na devops for dinner to you like how you\nknow what what skill sets do you bring\nto the table\num certs help and again like if they're\nlooking to like specialize in like one\nthing like Azure right you know\ndefinitely recommend like starting with\nthe AZ 900 again I don't have it um I\nkind of just you know went through the\nfire flames I didn't learned it on it's\nthe best way though yeah it's the best\nway uh but yeah like if they're looking\nlike you know of course Azure 900 but\nthen in terms of like outside of certs\nlike that can build your general\nknowledge CompTIA asserts are very very\nuseful just because it's uh you know\nwhat is it vendor neutral knowledge\nidentify\num and you know that'll help you\nanywhere right if you know networking\nyou can pick up networking in Azure you\ncan pick up networking and idws gcp\nversus just being specialized in just\nAzure right\nyeah yeah no I think like so it's this\nhas been like a really long going debate\non both of our channels is\nwe get questions about hey what do which\nshould I do when I think Gwen nailed it\nin her like previous videos that\nand your response was really good\nabout you know how they're like a good\nfilter for HRS yeah how they're really\ngood if you're just starting out because\nI think they're good\nway to get like structured learning\nbecause think of someone who is really\nnew\num they don't know where to start I\nthink so like let's say easy 900 or\nCloud practitioner kind of teaches you\nlike hey start here like learn what\ncloud computing is the next thing would\nbe the pricing models the next thing is\nthis and this so there is a structure\nway to learn which can get overwhelming\nfor someone who is just beginning yeah\nso that structure is really good part of\nit but if you just do the search for\nlike for just the passing sake\nand like getting badges on LinkedIn yeah\nyeah I'm definitely gonna create a video\nbecause Gwen knows this I did 12 Subs in\n11 months in a year\num and some of them are just sat and\nlike passed I didn't even have to study\nbut they didn't bring me anywhere like\nnot much value only two or three search\nbrought like the actual value to me\nbecause I sat down and learned things\num yeah for devops give me a second I'm\njust going to turn on the heater I'll be\nback it's a big call where I'm at\nyeah for devops yeah you just gotta like\neven in Cloud it's just gonna be like\nget Hands-On get packs your hands dirty\nand come learn to Cloud uh we have a lot\nof issues open\nwe have good amount of documentation\nwe have some devops tasks though could\nthey we have some devops tasks yeah and\nit'll be nice because look at the\ntraffic look at the numbers we shared uh\nit will be nice to put on your resume\nthat you submitted to three PRS to yeah\nCloud yeah I've been looking to to like\nagain give back to the community or like\nyou know help other people\nto you know break into Tech because it's\nhard it's I mean I'm gonna be honest\nit's hard especially like if yeah you\ndon't have those connects right like if\nyou didn't go to a prestigious\nUniversity that has all those events for\nyou the networking the people right it's\nkind of hard to just kind of show up and\nhey you know you guys hiring\nlike they don't know who you are\num and yeah so definitely I'm always\nlooking to help do you so this person\nasks what's your info on Discord can you\nbe my mentor do you do mentorships I\ndon't know if that's um I mean I I have\nuh I work with two interns that we have\nthat really they're really great um I'm\nI don't know if I could be a mentor I\nmean I'm still learning myself yeah but\nI could definitely you know help answer\nquestions you know when if when when\navailable right you you got a Twitter or\nsomething like what like what what's the\nbest one LinkedIn like I I have I'm\nworking on my LinkedIn and I was\nactually even thinking about uh because\nI remember I started seeing some of your\ncontent on Tick Tock and I was actually\nyeah and you know I was like I was like\nmaybe I should post but most of it is uh\nyou know I do I'm I'm part of a Discord\nserver that uh is for students of the\nlocal Community College where I'm from I\ndo I do a lot of help through there with\nlike other students or\num you know people that just need\nGeneral help with with if we're doing\nthe same sir or or class\ngot it got it so\num what I'm gonna do later is in the\ndescription of this video\num like at the minute that you come in\nI'm gonna drop like I don't know some\nkind of link that you would be like the\nbest way to reach you like you can give\nit to me on Discord because we're we're\non Discord now\num we're gonna have someone else on so\nit was great having you yeah I would\nlove to have you on another time like to\ntalk a little bit more about oh I\npersonally have more interest in knowing\nabout like like the military experience\nwhat would the transition like like all\nthat kind of stuff because I feel like\nthose stories in Tech aren't shared that\nmuch but I feel like we need to dedicate\na whole session to that yeah\num but yeah I'll be in touch with you\nand I really appreciate you hopping on\nlike out of nowhere\nwe'll talk to you soon all right take\ncare bye cheersthat was awesome we gotta get that\nawesome yeah we have a another guest\nthat we want to come on I I wish we\ncould have kept talking but\num\ndid you get a link\nyeah I have a feeling people are gonna\nknow this this dude\nwe're all still learning learn to do it\nteach it facts\nuh this this doesn't work\nwhat yeah I deleted it I don't know why\nit's still showing\num\nhello\nwhat country are you in now hello\nI'm in London nice\nfor like what a day until you travel\nagain or like two weeks I'm going to U.S\nthis one\nwhat part are you coming to New York\nI am going to be in New York yeah\nyou gotta you gotta meet him come on\nyeah\nI'll be in Florida then New York like a\nweek and then L.A\nall right La nice so there's an event\nthere I'm speaking at yeahwhen is thatseventh and eight right canal yeah\nseventh and eighth oh February or\nFebruary they're running a conference\nyeah it's in Temple how big is the\nconference like well how many attendees\nexpecting it uh around you know\n1000 and we have Steve Wozniak coming inall right wait for I feel like you came\nin and we didn't even introduce you some\npeople most people probably already know\nyou but this is Kunal devops go if you\ngo on YouTube just try probably type in\njust Kunal he'd probably come up there\num I've never spoken to you I think\nwe've spoken maybe on DM but I haven't\nspoken to you on like voice face chat\nanything you and rishab kind of know\neach other right\nyeah we we met at hackcon in per like we\nhave been I've known him from YouTube\nand Twitter and all of the social\nnetworks but then I met him in person uh\nwe went out on dinner and played some\nbar games and stuff really\num at hack on yeah it was it was fun\ntime good event yeah\nvery cool right after the week I saw you\ngoing when I was at your place\noh that was this summer yeah yeah\nwow my camera looks so\nbad compared to yours what camera do you\nuse it's I I use the this is the good\none\nbut that looks nice and crispy it's it's\nrunning out of battery so you have a\ndummy battery power\nwhat what camera do what's the good one\nwhich one is it\nthat's the a6400 nice that's the one you\nhave for sure\nno yeah mine is 50 yeah 5100\nI think so\nnice same thingI can't tell the difference between life\nthis and full-frame cameras and Eddie\nhas like really big heavy one Kai can't\ntell the difference I probably like mine\nmy thing like The Lens comes out like so\nit's like right there it's like so bad I\ndon't know how the arm thingy is holding\nit I feel like it's gonna like come\napart in a little bit but\nyeah Canal what certifications so people\nget if they want to get into devops well\nactually how do you what do you think\nabout certifications I don't know your\nopinion yeah I don't have any\ndo you think they're a waste of time no\nI think um\nI'll tell the truth no I don't think I\ndon't think it's mandatory\num\nand it's just not just me I I spoke to\nlike a lot of people and this is guys\nyou know I work with Siam he has a lot\nof like he has like every equivalent\ncertification and he himself told me\nlike that you know it's not really\nmandatory uh sometimes like there are\njob requirements you know let's say you\nhave to have AWS certifications because\nAWS is very complex soI know\num hot takes yeah it is fun I don't know\nyou don't have you don't have any\ncertifications not even expired ones\nuh no I don't have any wait did you go\nto college I don't know I don't know a\nlot I graduated yeah from what what\ndegree camera signs\num still waiting and this isn't the guy\nwho used to work uh look at you while he\nwas a a VP he worked at Microsoft as\nwell and he also had like\nso I asked him why he's like just you\nknow\nI don't know\nbut I I I don't on the other hand I know\npeople who have a lot of certifications\nand\nin the end I think it's just about if\nthe job requires it or whatever I'll\nthink I think like certifications\nprovide like for some people like a\nstructured roadmap that helps everyone\nlearns differently\num so if you need that structured\nroadmap that feeling of accomplishment\nyeah you can do some nice certifications\nyeah yeah I don't think it's mandatory\nI'd be in trouble if it wasyeah that's that's how I feel and I know\ngoing YouTube because remember like we\nwere talking about this on like when you\ndid your CDA like the certified\ndeveloper associate like\nthe and it was not for just getting the\ncertificate like our real purpose was to\nlearn this new technology to learn cloud\nand like have a structured path because\nthere was not a lot of content that was\navailable at the time and not a lot of\nguidance that was available for free\nand like I'm glad I did those\ncertificates like no regrets but then\nthe purpose shouldn't be just getting a\nnew badge to like showing your signature\nor show on your resume\num because those get like caught so\neasily in in an interview\num and yeah I feel like people miss the\npurpose of why you need to get\ncertificate and that's also the reason I\nhate content that says get Solutions\narchitect and own six figure salary like\nthat's not the reality I get it it gets\ngreat numbers it get people's hopes high\nbut you need to show the reality that\nthere is a lot of hard work that's so\ngood to go in yeah yeah clickbait\ncontent I just remember I have one but I\nit's so irrelevant I forgot about it\nwell you have a video like that no no no\nno no no oh I was like I was like wait\nwhatit's a Google Cloud associate Cloud\nengineer nice\nbecause I don't even remember when I got\nit\n20 20. that wasn't too long ago okay\nyeah three years agooh someone says the dod sector requires\nbase level certificate like so the\ngovernment yeah but who wants to work\nfor the governmentI know guysjust kidding just kidding I know some\npeople enjoy it I yeah personally\nwouldn't but\nthat's fine what are the hot takes Kunal\nyou always have hot takes come on there\nis this Friday afternoon\nI don't know what I just I I just share\nlike what's already out there some\npeople don't like it yeah that's why\nthat's that's why yeah yeah we'll\nconsider it as a hot take and like\nyeah no we're talking about layoffs you\ntell me like how how's it going I'm not\nmuch like I haven't really checked I\njust saw some news like Google laid off\n12 000. yeah so like in total this week\nI think we lost\n30 what 30 to 40 000 engineers\njust in big Tech then we I don't know\nwhat the other the other ones yeah\nthat's a good amount of Engineerstech people yeah I should rephrase it\nyeah yeah tech people that we lost\nwhy do you think that is happening we've\ngot too much hiding during koi\nyeah yeah definitely\num I have that personal opinion I think\nI shared it during the start of the\nstream is I know a lot of companies are\nsaying that but I also saw that\nhappening there was too much hiring\num pre-covered too like in 2019 I I knew\nlike how much hiring was going on for\neach like role they were like you know\n500 2\n000 people lined up for interviews not\napplying lined up and like\nthat's that is a really big number\num for\njust a year and then once I got into\nGoogle I don't I won't share anything\nthat's like in my end here or stuff but\nI I could see like how the hiring\nprocess is and how much\nlike fast they were increasing the the\ncount\nthe head count\num\nand with the recession I think it just\nmade it worse like\nthe the the thought okay now we have to\nlike lose some numbers\num we had really rapidly in\nnow we don't have uh like we just have\nto be safe for the future right so\nyeah\nto be honest that's what I think yeah\nMicrosoft the CEO said we want to do\npeople should want to do\nlike they're looking to do more with\nless\num\nwhich I think is\nyeah understandable\nit's a business you know yeah business\nis business\ncost cost efficiency is going to be\nreally really important for this year\nespecially with Cloud yeah\nI'm going to keep on I saw like four\nstartups that were just doing like\ncosmosis yeah it's a big thing I heard\nabout it he's a good question\ntechnical skills becoming obsolete by\nautomation future will be more focused\non Vision ideas and implementation\nwhat do you guys think\nI think\nyeah definitely like Char gbt will\nuh\nreplace some stuff\nI definitely think so not just in Tech\nbut like uh my you know my colleague\ntold me about this lawyer he met\nuh not a lawyer like a person he met who\nworks with lawyers and he was like you\nknow what like you know you don't know\nwhat this chat gbt thing you know it'll\nbe like lawyers will be replaced real\nestate stuff will be replaced and he was\nlike very aggressive about it\num\nbut yeah I think it's interesting like\nimagine you know lawyers being replaced\nwith child gbt but the other thing is\nlike would you trust her you know charge\nequity for your legal stuff uh it's an\ninteresting question and then how do you\nmake up for it like all these jobs being\nreplaced like you know if you talk about\nfor example content content writers\nright uh if you want to gonna get some\npiece written and you just can either\ngive it to one person and pay them and\nthen they will give it to you after a\nfew hours or you can just give it to\nlike a chat GPT like tool and um it can\ndo it for you\nso obviously people would prefer the\nchat CPT one because everyone wants you\nknow that efficiency and if it if it can\nget the job done people will you know\nprefer it the real question is can you\nreally tell that if it's you know\nwritten by a a an AI or a person if we\nreach that level where you can't tell\nI don't know and I would use it but then\nthe question arises what do we do like\nto replace these jobs which is new jobs\nbeing created or whatever\num I don't know maybe maybe not in five\nyears maybe not in 10 years maybe not in\n20 years but in 30 years come on like\nit's coming I think it's called yeah I\nhave\nsorry go ahead it's not the first time\nthis has happened in the world like\nthink about when we used to use horses\nand then the car came along like I'm\nsure people who used to\nI was about to drive the horse like ride\nthe horse they were like oh what am I\ngoing to do with my job and then they\nfound something else to do right like\nwe've as a society or I guess as\nHumanity we figure these things out but\nAI is like completely different than you\nknow a horse so in a car so there's that\ntoo\nservos and then kubernetes came along\npeople like we'll use our job to Gates\nautomation but it's created you know\nmore jobs more certificatesI think it's also the about like it's\nit's also the thing about adoption like\nif how rapid is the adoption to how\nrapid is people utilizing that tool in\ntheir lives\nthe reason why I say that because I have\na I have a bit of an observation\nabout\nbecause it was being used at\num The Institute that I teach at\nso it's already seeing like chat GPT\nlike being used to write essays and to\nwrite assignments\num to write\nuh\nwhich is fine because at the end of the\nday it's a tool right but then there's\na thing about you know plagiarism\nthere's things about like who gets the\ncredit of\num this piece if it's written by a\nstudent or does it Con like would you\nconsider it cheating because now they\ndidn't\nlike you can still consider it research\nbut\nlike if they really don't understand the\nunderlying\narticle that they read and the copied\nlike what's the point of you know having\num\nlike these assessments\nbut then again I know that people will\ncome at me and say like education is\nalready very behind like we shouldn't\nhave treason papers right\nI alone cannot change that\nand I don't like I don't have the power\nto change it it's like a really big uh\nyou know organization and it like you\nneed several\num bills that needs to be passed before\nUm this can be changed and chat GPT can\nbe included as a tool rather than a\ncheating material\num but yeah I I really think it will\ndepend on adoption and the efficiency\nand like just what Canal said about like\nhow great at it like how great it will\nbe at writing stuff or creating stuffthe most\nimmediate opportunity is to become\nefficient at asking chat yes questions\nso you can get a more efficient answer\nso if you can utilize it then utilize it\nto your favorite because it's not going\naway no it is not\nit's it's like those things you have\nseen those videos where the like I've\nseen few you know where they're they're\nreally Advanced users who know how to\nuse Google like with kiwis and stuff\nyeah\nso they have just you know gained an\nexpertise on like using their Curie\nlanguage that Google uses and they get\nreally good and streamlined results and\nsame thing is with chat gbt like if you\ncan get the answer you want\num yeah\nis talking to someone who used to work\nat Google AI and then you told me that\num\nwhat Google has in comparison to charge\nGPT it's much much stronger where is it\nyeah it's like I can't I I even I don't\nknow it's internal stuff yeah they're\ngonna kill it after three months though\njust like stadia and all that kind of\nstuffthat's a hot take that reminds me of a\npage they have like Yeah by Google right\nyeah something like that guys\nI keep hearing platform engineering what\nthe hell is platform engineering I keep\nhearing that it's going to take over\ndevops but I'm too lazy to Google what\nit isI think it's only going to just rename\nfancy stuff you know I think it's only\nI think it's only like\nlike the next phase but basically\nencouraging more of what devops is so in\nterms of like you know uh you you you\ntalk about the so in the software\ndevelopment life cycle we have the you\nknow deployments and the monitoring\nstuff and the continuous feedback and\nthen management and you use Automation\nand stuff and that's what basically you\nknow devops stuff and platform\nengineering is about you take these\nprocesses and the best practices and\nit's basically it is you're using the\nthe devops burnout this thing devops\nburnout\num and using these you know the things\nthat I just mentioned about deployment\nmanagement monitoring you know these\ntools and the processes and all the best\npractices so you make this into like a\nlike a service\nthen you can use it across various teams\nin your organization like various\nengineering teams for various use cases\nso initially so basically the idea is to\nreduce the burnout that folks may be\nhaving with devops\num\nand even with devops we talk about many\npeople have their own like you know\nterms like some people say okay they're\noff to engineer some people say I have\nno idea what a devops engineer is devops\nis not a title so\nI I get it like it's fine you can get\ninto jargon but um I I don't think it\nwill take over I think it's only if\nsomething is\nformed out of like enhancing a\nparticular thing it's not like taking\nover it it's just it's just\nyeah it's elevating it a little bit\num\nyeah\nyeah I think yeah you're the previous\ndebate I saw people doing was like SRE\nversus devops but then people realized\nthat it's two different things\num but yeah to be honest I remember\nbeing Cloud engineer and still doing\ndevops things even though my title\ndidn't say that\nso at the end of the day it's just how\nyou want to Define it and how companies\nwant to define a certain rule even\nthough you might be doing same things\nthat\num\nsomeone at company X is doing as a\nplatform engineer and you are doing that\nas a devops engineer at company yEP taking a more\nproductization View\nEd I'm not gonna lie I still don't get\nthe difference\nlike I feel like it's just like a\nbuzzword or like it's over complicating\nor like I feel like there's not a need\nfor it but then again I'm not very\nversed in the devops space in general so\nI'm still like I don't know maybe I'll\nGoogle it later or something probably\nwon't\nwait what does it say here hold on a\nplatform engineer will create the\nprogram do all the cicd do all the SRE\nwork and devs so you're literally trying\nto get one person to do everything this\nsounds like they're trying to save money\nversus over here having to consult with\na devops engineer about how to take this\nto the cloud than needing and necessary\nto set up monitoringsorry yeah I was the devops engineer I\ndid set up\nrapid seven data dog\num pager Duty and I was one I was the\none who was being paged I was no SRE\num so like platform engineer that's why\num\nwe figured it out\nthey took advantage of started it this\nsounds like they're trying to get a\nwhole team with one new run they just\ncreated a new role like oh and then\nthey're they're pushing it it's a\nconspiracy they're pushing it to replace\nplatform yeah Icarus wizard it equals\nlike rocks you know how they call it\nlike 10x developers 100x developers yeahyeah I'm a 1X\nno no that there was a nice quote by\nKelsey oh no we haven't heard\nso it said that uh 10x developer is not\nuh someone who works 10x harder it's who\nmakes 10 other Engineers you knowbetter okay okay okay that's a nice spin\nto it\nhold on here's a good one coming from it\nmanaged services do you think SRE would\nbe an easier environment to adopt since\nyou're coming from infrastructure\nmanagement\nwhat what's the question here coming\nfrom it managed services do you think\nSRE would be easier environment adopt\nsince you're like to get into that role\nI don't understand yeah I can tell you\nthis it can get stressful for some\num I remember receiving an alert at 2AM\n3am and I've talked about it several\ntimes on the podcast I've done with\nGrant and streams\num like I my sleep is terrible now\nbecause I get up to like the lightest\nnoise because that's how my brain is\nwired for being on call for three years\nso\nyeah it can get stressful and I told you\nwhen towards the end I was like on call\nevery alternate week so it is not fun\nespecially if you have too many outages\nuh but then again it's your duty to make\nyour infrastructure more reliable and\navailable\num so yeah\nif you're fine with getting up at 3M\nlooking at Linux server in the command\nline and going through logs and figuring\nout what's going on while you sip your\ncoffee that's fine but I find it really\nhard if you have family and stuff\num to like have that kind of\nresponsibility so I don't miss my\non-call days but I learned a lotThe Villages an example of platform\nengineering you're creating a\nself-service automated solution\nbut even that product is not pitched as\nplatform engineering I'm gonna maybe\nthey should I'm gonna go hit up Savannah\nthis is product lead like hey you're\nmissing out on some buzzwords here you\nshould slap platform engineering on that\nand you're good it's just pitched us a\ndeveloper tool really yeah oh I think I\nmight I could be wrong I haven't checked\ntheir marketing stuff lately\nhi can we convert terraform\nconfiguration to a diagram I don't know\nyeah use the data from graph command\ns chat GPT it probably knows how to do\nit for you\nthat is so bad for your health oh the\nsleep yeah umwhat what else is here it really depends\nuh hold on\nthe other day someone told us that they\nwere trying to hire remember rishab they\nwere trying to hire a cloud engineer\nwith oh yeah to 20 something years of\nexperience\nthat was crazy\nfreaking crazy\nthank you guyswhat would you accept as a salary if you\nhad 20 years of experienceum I don't know ask me in 20 years come\non man we can't get anything out of you\nyeah it's like sipping his water in\nsuper chill he's like no I'm not getting\ninto these baits\nyeah because they're gonna clip it\nthey're gonna clip it's gonna go viral\non Twitter I think until I was gonna\nbecause I was gonna get canceled 20\nyears\nI don't know if money would still be\nthere in 20 years okay how many Bitcoin\nwill you accept\nnow he'll say well it depends on the\nvalue of Bitcoin in 20 years we'll see\nin 20 years right\nthe the only reason I asked is because\nyeah as Gwen was saying we saw like some\nchatter in our Discord Channel like a\ncompany trying too hard like a mid-level\nor senior level\nCloud engineer with 20 years of\nexperience and the pay range was like\nnot great I think\nor something so that's why like I was\njust trying to get your opinion\nyeah I know people who like\numthis guy he got offered 450k at Amazon\nto lead their Europe region\n450k base yeah 450k he was going to lead\nyeah I feel like that's kind of low\nyeah to lead a team perfect team or\nsomething yeah\nhow many years of experience did this\nperson have\nquite a lot yeahthere's a lot of money\nthere there is and that's why like I\nthink Gwen said it's less\num because you can never feel like yeah\nyeah no not saying that we like would\nlike I don't even imagine what I would\ndo if I own that amount of money but\nthe reason why I said that is I've seen\ndata that there are like some especially\nlike if you see staff level or you know\nprincipal level Engineers who are\nearning\n550k to like 600k and they're not\nleading a team they're just like\nindividual contributors right so that's\nwhy I was like if he's leading like a\nfew like a whole like you know\nengineering department and it's it's a\nmore tedious work I guess what I'm\ntrying to say\nit's not for Canada or sorry yeah\nstrictly U.S strictly U.S how are Europethat's that's uh setting pound or\nsomething\nuh yeah\n450 I guess in Europe is significant\nsignificant and it's also significant\nnot only in Europe because you know\nagainst like us I believe is kind of\nexpensive in certain terms right well I\nknow yes specifically\nEurope are less in general than the US\nyeah so\ndo you recommend Discord and why\ndo you guys recommend Discord\nis discard sponsoring us\nI'm just kidding yeah we do recommend\nthis code that's why like our\ncommunities are in this code\nI like how this is free\non slack you have to like pay inside\nyeah for like history and things\nwhatyou no longer need to get into\nmanagement to get more money is Kunal\nare you a manager are you I'm a messy\nyeah wow\nhow do you feel about that do you like\nit\nit's good too much uh\nI'm trying to travel less\num\nbut overall it's good I'm doing a bunch\nof things because we are like a small\nteam which is what I like uh get to do\neverything uh how big is the whole\ncompany\nlike 40 people\num so like multiple hats it's good\num especially I graduated last year so I\nhave the freedom to like experiment\nbuild my profiles Gloria lore\num especially if you graduated last year\nthat that thing is what amazing wait so\nwhat you're like what 20 years old\nsomething like that yeah\nso see that is what like amuses me every\ntime is like you met me at hack on he's\nlike\nI lead the devil team at sibo and I'm\nlike didn't you just tweet that you were\ngoing to graduate in like October or\nsomething I was like yeah\nI'm like an eel after\nbecoming one\nso you were working in your third year I\nwas a student for more than a year how\ndid you get that job as a student I\nstarted as an intern uh\nin my and like in my third year or\nsomething\nand then I\num\nso I I got uh I got one at Google\nit didn't depending and then they sort\nof like revoked the offer because of uh\ncoed\num so I got one at c1n and then um\nyeah I started small like as an intern\nand then after two three months uh Mark\nwas like doing good give him gave me\nsome more stuff to do\num and then uh one year went by then he\nwas like you can you should join full\ntime and join full-time\num in September last year\nso it works for like 1.5 years what time\nish or something while I was a studenthow did you manage yeah I just didn't go\nto universitybut I don't recommend doing that if\nyou're if your University is nice then\num and make the most out of it was yours\nnot nice mine was not good so I didn't\ngo I just went to like give exams and\nget the degree but I didn't really\nattend lectures or anything because it\nwas finally\nfinally got a hot take out of him yeahI'm not saying it worked Gwen it worked\nit's not every University is not today\nit's just like it's just weird like\nwe don't get together okay then just\ndon't go there definitely yeah I'm a bit\nfamiliar with and that's that's the\nthat's the primary reason you know I ran\nor not ran I moved to Canada\num after my like ran away I ran away I'm\nlike\nif it's not good qualities like you know\nI'm gonna spend the same amount of money\non my education in India which\nmight suckum some like better spend the same\namount of money where I can at least you\nknow\nhave good career opportunities which I\nguess I'm doing better than I would have\nbeen so\nin India if you if you don't go to a top\nschool\nyou're like you have like little chance\nof Landing a job I think you need to\nwork hard like you need to\nyeah yeah like you like Canal is a great\nexample I guess in that case like he's a\nperfect story here\num that you need to be\nyou need to get out of your comfort zone\ngo out and create opportunities for\nyourself\neven study at certain points by yourselfis it expensive\numI don't think so compared to the states\nit's not very my my entire University is\na private one but funded by government\num I mean there's one main University\nand then mine it has multiple colleges\nin it colleges in it so it's pretty\naverage stuff uh it was like\nwait I'm doing a conversion ofit's like four thousand pounds for four\nyears\nokay yeah it's not yeah that's like\nlike you can't even get a year here yeah\nI was gonna say that's like a semester\nand the Very premium colleges in India\nif you want to go to like premium\npremium ones\num\n20 000 pounds for the entire year but\ncompared to what people make there is it\nexpensive uh\nI would say it's yeah it's a relative\nrelatively okay yeah like people in U.S\nmake a lot more money and that's why I\nthink the but tuitions are still really\nhigh and that's why I think it's hard\nfor\nlike us as International students to\nmove to us and that's why like I chose\nCanada and also like a college instead\nof a four-year degree\nwhich can be really expensive if you\nconsider you know the household income\nis in Indian rupees yeah\nIndia is the only country one of the one\nof the countries where the term\ndegree is not mandatory it does not\napply you need one\nyeah really yeahin the U.S you don't need a degree if\nyou want to get a tech job\nyour skills and network and everything\nIndia you need one\nit's like\nit's like any other I would say Asian\ncountry Canal like that's my\nunderstanding of it\nlike you know if you see\nChina or South Korea\num like you need like I've heard people\nsay that yeah you in in any profession\nyou need a degree you need four years of\ncollege education too\npursue a career\num whereas I see that it's changing it's\na lot different in the west right\nnot okay not doctor and like accounting\nstuff I know they that those professions\nstill need degrees but in Tech it's a\ndifferent thing\num but yeah and also I think when it's\nlike really a household thing too in\nIndia like\nit's like written down like okay it's\nlike you do high school high school yeah\nyou're gonna go to college like pick\nwhat you want to do\noh so the option to not go is not even\nit's not even an option like you you you\nhave to go like the option is what do\nyou want to go for it's a it's a norm I\nwould say yeah\num I won't say there are not Exceptions\nthere are definitely exceptions but\nin a normal\nyeah it's very rare that your family\nwould allow you not to go to college\nhere either so there are two reasons why\nyou would not go to a college in India\nfor like after a university for\nengineers either your family is very\nrich or your family is very poor\nI think that's a really good video wow\nthat's a tweet right there\nyeah so that's there are two reasons\nyeah\nwe don't have any like football\nscholarships like no one cares oh yeah\nwe don't have any extra calligraphy like\nthe national level player they don't\ncare really yeah you won't get\nscholarships you okay\njust a like bit more context on that you\ncan be\nin government jobs like you will be\ngiven preference if you're a national\nlevel player or like you're good in some\nkind of sports you can get government\njobs easily but education wise no\nand government jobs are good it's all\nright it's stable but it doesn't have\nlike a very good\nI don't know\num\nimage\npeople want it it's it's like because\nthey never get fired with condoms even\nif they don't do their jobs that's why\ngovernment banks are very like slow and\neverything you know because people just\ndon't care\num\nso that's why most people are like in\nthe like rural areas or whatever they're\nlike we want government job because you\nknow the stability and perks you know\nyou get the perks for government jobs\npension and\nfree like you know house quarters and\nyeah all the benefits Essentials you get\numbut um\nyeah it's just like the bare minimum\nyeah yeah it's not exciting like it's I\nthink it's same here too yeah\nhere too the government is boring but\nstable\nyeah Davis yeah very stable you won't\nsee like rapid growth in your career too\nlike it'll be slow growth but it's\nstable no kubernetes in the government\nno platform Engineering in the\ngovernment\nthey still call it tech consultants yeah\nlike no way you're on like I said you're\non C sharp one done it framework\nwhatever the first one was no golang no\nrust none of that kind of stuff\nwait I didn't share about this stream\nlet me do that from\ncome on yeah get us get us to like your\nnumbers make us famous like youwait someone asked what role was Moe's\nhit by the layoffs\nrecruiters\nsomeone commented that toowell yeah because they'd obviously they\ndon't want to hire as much so I guess\nthat makes the most senseumyeah give us some fast kuna famous as a\nservice\n[Laughter]\nhow do you like London how long have you\nbeen there now\nuh I moved on 7th Jan where I was I was\ntraveling before then uh quite a lot so\nit's good it's very nice lots of things\nto do\num it's one thing people say it's\nexpensive\nI think\nit's a very important it's cheaper to\ncompare like compared to India it's\ncheaper that's a very controversial\nopinion I'll explain why I understand\nthat expensive right I understand that\num\nthe energy bill is expensive water bill\nis expensive I get that that's fine but\nthe tax is low\nright houses are cheaper as compared to\nIndia compared to compared to the money\nyou are making here\ncompared to India as well if like if you\nwant to buy a villa\nI see that in India is like in Delhi\nwhere I live let's say GK greater\nkailash is a very popular area yeah you\nwant to buy a villa over there it's 100\ncrores easily same thing if I look\naround London it's just like 10 crores\none day yeah I checked the prices and\neverything\none more thing is the cars in India get\na lot of import Duty so because you get\nreally cheap uh the same model of a car\nif you're getting in India for two\nhundred thousand dollars the same you\ncan get in UK for ninety thousand same\nexact configuration\nespecially like if you're into luxury\ncars they're really cheap when you\ncompare it even though like groceries\nare expensive and everything uh\nI I still think it's it's nice it's it's\na for the long term if you're gonna buy\na house and one main thing is like the\nweather is very nice like no pollution\nair pollution still like India a lot I\nlove India but I think\nfor me it's not I'm like I'm not like\nbound to UK If I miss India I'll just\nbook a flight and I'll go tomorrow my\nwork is completely\num so there's there's no I I'm not\nbounded to a country uh I can go\nanywhere I want did you move did you\nmove forward\nyeah I I moved to like uh I'm gonna work\nmore closely with the team because I I\nreally even though I promote remote work\nI really like the hybrid culture\nand uh yeah I wanted to work more\nclosely with the you knowum and I wanted to go to uh so I was I'm\ngoing to travel a lot during like a few\nyears and London is just like the right\nspot Europe all the countries are near\nthe flights are not too long us is near\nso if I'm traveling every month\nit's from India doing that it's it's too\nmuch yeah yeah travel time yeah yeah\nisn't it like from New York isn't it\nlike what 12 hours or something or more\nto London no no no India 14 or 15 hours\n16 74 14 15 hours yeah\nthat's what I'm doing in September\nfrom Toronto to like Delhi it's\nI always hate it but you know you have\nto do it that's really smart too like\nyeah I think if you if you thought of\nthat already that you're gonna travel\nand like you chose London like that's\nlike right in the middle of the East and\nthe West I guess\nI had the option for you else but I I\ndon't like the laws\nwhat loss just like immigration laws\nit's very tiring like getting a Visa and\nthen you know\num getting a permanent residency permit\nvery very too much wait times and\num\nthat the lottery system or whatever yeah\nsomething I didn't want to do is\nLondon well I guess the UK better yeah\nvery easy with immigration so easy got\nmy Visa in five days uh you can get a\npermanent like residency permit if not\nyou if you don't want citizenship you\ncan get permanent residency permit very\nsimple\nvery super easy yeah how about Canada\nlike what's your take on Canada it's too\ncold\nI know that Gwen\nuh with Canada uh\nI I didn't I did no research but I know\nCanadians are nicest people on earth\nsee\nyou gotta represent\num I'm at Marino uh I was in Canada I\nmet Andrew and Tara from battle snake\nmetricia\nso you you can tell a Canadian and you\nreally know you see a Canadian you'll\nknow they're from Canada\nbecause of how they talk and how kind\nthey are\nI I think I heard you say that you don't\nlike New York\nyeah\num\nno I like New York\nyou want to live here though\nI I think living in New York is a\ndifferent thing and you know visiting is\na different thing I wouldn't know what\nit's like to live until I've lived there\num but um from what I did like with my\nvisits it's it's okay but\nyeah it's uh it's too many blocksyeah\nI remember walking no the New York is\ngreat uh I enjoy every time I come but\num\nyeah just I it's not it's I'm neutral so\nit's not you know like you visit New\nYork and you're like oh my God New York\nCity wish I could you know live there or\nwhatever I didn't feel that I was like\nokay not even the first time yeah very\ngood no not even the first time okay New\nYork very nice good food great people\nvery good very good uh but I didn't get\nthe urge to like Okay so let's move here\nbut it doesn't mean it's not good it\njust means that it's uh I'm not the New\nYork type maybe yeah but I really love\nit because if I didn't then I wouldn't\nyou know visit again and again visiting\nagain\num\nyeah\nbut the one the thing would use me I\nthink it's it's more about people than\nthe place you know and uh I think that's\nwhat it is\nyeah maybe maybe one day I'll come for a\nmonthin the summer you gotta come like June\nis the perfect perfect month to be in\nNew York perfect weather July is all\nright but like the lit the last half of\nJuly and then August is too hot too\nyou should be a politicianuh the same I mean I I was there in uh\nNovember\nand now I'm gonna and then I was there\nwhen was hackcon whenever hakon was and\nthen I was I'm gonna come in like\nI want to see New York snow I want to\ncome to no snow yet yeah no there's\nstill snow there no it hasn't snowed at\nall\nwhat what\nokay hasn't snowed yet you can come to\nCanada go to Canada for like\nfrom what the member to like\nFebruary or March and you'll see see\nsnow so there's a lot of time you can\nseek snow\nyeah it was like super sunny here today\nit was warm like it's snowed in London\nafter two years\nyeah\nI was going to ask like how do you\nbecause I know it was it was not a big\nchallenge for me because you know I was\njust\nlike a 17 year old so I could eat fast\nfood a lot at that time but like how do\nyou deal with like Indian food\nnow I'm cooking myself nice\nyeah that's the only way that's how I\nlearned this I started cooking myself\nand London has incredible Indian\nrestaurants nice yeah some are better\nthan India\nso good another controversial thing but\nit's true\nI gotta visit London yeah dishoom I had\npav bhaji there I was\nso good and I had a Dosa near my like\nthis is just like a is an Indian family\nthey have a dosa restaurant\nit's like a local second best dose I\nhave had what what is a a dosa\num it's like uh you know how you had\nnone with me yeah\nit's a really thin version of it but\nit's also not wheat so it's like right\nit's really healthy for you but it's\nalso really lightweight like it's really\nthin it's like like a tin pancakepotatoes and then yeah\nvery goodNew York dosa so\na DOTA man of New York\nis very popular I'll have to try the\nthing with me is like I can't handle\nspicy food so it's not it's not so\nyou'll also get like a coconut chutney\nthing it's like\nthat's really good for like soothing\nyour\nyou know gut and stuff\nso it's it's the opposite of\nwhat we tried Gwen\nso Kunal I made her try like the\ntraditional Punjabi Cuisine you know you\nhave your Dal you have your butter\nchicken and chicken and for that like\nfor her it was a bit spicy\num\nand it was also was like a lot of\nquantity I guess we were not able to\nfinish it yeah we had a couple of things\nwe thought they were going to be smaller\nbut they gave us good portions yeah and\nhow easy it a lot\nkeep that in white\nthe one thing with the UK is that some\nrestaurants uh make the food based on\nthe taste of like britishers it's not a\nbig Indian food and um it for someone\nwho is from India it would just taste\nlike really\ndifferent and not very good mediocre\nyeah but yeah that was authentic\nrestaurants\nthat was true for like\nsome of the restaurants that I visited\nearly on here in Canada too it's like\nreally\num\nyou know for Canadians so that they can\nconsume it and then now I think I have\nfound some good places that are like\nreally authentic and like the good thing\nis the ones that are good are usually\nlike local restaurants there no not\nchains and stuff they're like a\nfamily-run restaurants they cook\nthemselves and you know it just reminds\nme of my home\nbutter chicken was considered more a\ndessert in India not true\nit is considered sweet\nbut it is not considered a dessert like\nit's a main course dish at least what I\nknow of\nyeah it's main course yeahhere says\nintake butter chicken pizza\nyep we have that here too it's good you\ngotta try itleave it to the U.S to make or North\nAmerica to make anything Pizza wait what\nis this\nyeah that's also like a paneer dish\njust like we had butter chicken there's\nbutter paneer but then\nthere's also sharpeni it's again like\nprevious cottage cheeseit's like tofu\nyeah it's like alternative to meat in\nIndia\nI see I see oh yeah that's right because\nwait but you come on do you eat meat\nbecause I Know Rich of you dude no Canal\ndoesn't yeah okay I do you do yeah yeah\nI remember that but Canal doesn't do the\nmajority of people in India don't yeah I\nwould say soum well I'll come back to this statement\num in North\nand in like South\nbut in the mid I think there are a lot\nmore people who don't eat meat but yeah\nNorth and South I think people eat a\ngood amount of meat like also in South I\nthink people are good with red meat like\nbeef uh and a lot of seafood\nand in North it's majority chicken\nbut like I have in my family no not is\nalso like uh\nlike the cold region so yeah we meet\nstuff over there in the in the west if\nyou go to like Gujarat and stuff there\npeople don't eat meat no yes like in the\nmidwest yeah if you go to West Bengal\nand you go to Mumbai Goa and stuff yes\npeople eat a lot\num I think majority people do yeah\nyeah\nthere's lots of people in my family do\nbut then there are also exceptions that\ndon't\nis it a food blog yes\ntoday on Fridays we talk about food\nhow are we going to afford all this\ndelicious food without jobs are you\nworried about getting laid off no no\nreally\nno\nis it just because you're confident in\nyour skill set or is just something you\ndon't care about\num\nI I\num so there's multiple things\nI haveI really\nso this the one thing is like I really\ntrust the people I work with because we\nknow you know what we're doing and\neverything\num but even though if there's let's say\na one percent chance I know that you\nknow I'll find another job okay it's all\nabout staying relevant\num someone was asking me how do we\nprevent to get laid off well you can't\nyou know you can't prevent because there\nwas this one guy worked 16 years at\nGoogle got laid off without a reason he\nmade a tweet 15 years it's a lot of yeah\nyeah\nso I I don't think you can prevent to\nget laid off if you're getting laid off\nyour company has made up their mind yeah\nthey will they will you know just fire\nyou but the good thing is if you just if\nyou're relevant you have a good\nconnection of you know Network people\nhave the skills and you'll find another\njob and I know I have the skills and\nI'll find another job\num that's why I'm not worried and I\nthink\nI I it's not just about laying off I I\nnever worry about anything in lifeyou can't name one single thing that I\nwould be worried about\nreally nothing yeah yeah because I think\nit will be ironic because\nyou're earning the earning you know all\nuh nice and you know comfortable living\nand then you're you know\num\nyou you work so hard you know in\nUniversity and uh even after you know\ndoing all the work and the hard work and\nthe you know getting a nice job and you\nknow being able to afford you know food\nand all the things and traveling the\nworld even after all of these things I\nam worried about stuff then\nyou know better than the\nlike folks who can't make decisions you\nknow like like animals for example\nanimals don't have the ability to like\nmake decisions but we are humans we have\nthe ability to make decisions so even\nafter having all of these things and you\nknow what's the point of so much hard\nwork if in the end I'm still worried\nabout\nanything in my life right I've worked\ntoo much I work too hard to worry about\nthings like that's basically my way of\nputting it another point is that I don't\nworry about things that are out of my\ncontrol\nwhich is something that most people\nworry about so if you stop worrying\nabout things that are out of your\ncontrol you yourself will realize that\nyou are not worried about anything\nbecause people mostly they worry about\nthings that are out of their control\nbecause you can't do anything about it\nyou know so example when I was giving my\ninterviews right so there's let's say\nit's a good example let's say we take\ntwo people as uh\num hypothetical people\num so we take John Wick and Spider-Man\nso John Wayne and Spider-Man they're\nthey're like applying to a job right and\nthen they're preparing for the job and\nJohn Wick is like spending 100 of his\ntime preparing for interview right he's\ndoing lead code and you know projects\nand just studying and Spider-Man what\nSpider-Man is doing is he's spending 50\nof the time uh\nstudying and preparing for the interview\nand he's spending the rest of the 50\nworrying about the outcome like okay\nwhat what would happen what what would I\ndo if I don't get the job and you know\nall these other things so now if we\nimagine that both of them are on the\nsame level in terms of like mentality\nand who's going to get the who's going\nto prepare and who's gonna who's gonna\ngive a better interview it's going John\nWick right\nso\neven if you want to worry about like\nthere's obviously some things that are\ninevitable that you get to worry about\nbut\nif you don't worry about things out of\nyour control then I I I just never worry\nyeah that's a great way to end the\nstream with some positive deep\nphilosophical knowledge we've been doing\nthis for like almost three hours so I\ngotta go take a break Canal we gotta do\nthis again it's nice to chat with you\nyou're filled with knowledge at such a\nyoung age\nuh but all right everyoneum oh yeah it was it was great to have\nyou Canal um yeah we're gonna do this\nlike as a dedicated thing I know it was\nall random but yeah that's how we do\nthis\nas always it's in New York uh when\nyou're in New York yeah yeah maybe I'll\nbe there and Russia will see you in\nCanada yeah sorry about Florida first\nFlorida first Canada as well yep\ndefinitely\nall right bye everyone",
