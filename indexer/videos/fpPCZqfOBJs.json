  "title": "How I Successfully Study for Cloud Certifications",
  "transcript": "hey everyone today i want to talk to you\nabout\nwhy i think certifications are useful\nthis is actually just going to be more\nof um\nlike an extension of the blog post that\ni wrote on the acg blog\nso if you'd rather check that out i'm\ngoing to link that in the description\nwith that being said hi welcome to\nanother video i'm gps and let's get\nright into it\nalso say hello to my dog\nalright so this is the study setup that\ni use\nwhenever i'm learning really anything\ni'll have my study material\nso i'll go into a little bit as to what\ni have here on the left side\nin a second but let me go over to the\nside first i'll have my notes up here\nand i just use markdown i used to use\nnotion but now that i'm\nmoving my workflow over to open source\nno software i'm just using markdown and\ngithub to keep track of my notes\nso that stays up there on the top right\nand then\nhere i'll have either like as\nsshed into my vm that i'm working on or\nmaybe i'll have the uh some azure cli\ncommands that i'm running here whatever\nit is that i'm studying\num that's the hands-on portion will be\ndown here and then\nagain back to this side on the left i'll\nhave my actual study material\nand this is my first tip for y'all find\nmaterial that works for you\nyou can see i have this book open which\nis linux basic for hackers i talked\nabout this book\nin my previous video and then i also\nhave this course python 3 scripting for\nsysadmins\nand this is on the a-cloud guru platform\nall right so right off the bat i'm the\nfirst one to tell you from personal\nexperience that certifications have been\nbeneficial for my career\nbecause i got aws certified back a\ncouple years ago i landed an interview\nwhich led to a job which led to a cloud\nengineer promotion\nand most recently i took another\ncertification at the beginning of this\nyear\nlinux essentials linux linux essentials\nand that's led me to uh you know just\nreally enjoying this linux world and\nopen source world and and creating more\ncontent around that\nthat's been fantastic as well on\nlinkedin on twitter it's easy to find\npeople who bash certifications\nwho think they are a waste of time you\nknow i guess that's a fine opinion i\nhave there's also people who love them\nand\nare obsessed with collecting all the\nbadges and such\nand i guess that's also an okay opinion\nto have frankly my way of learning and\nmy way of living\ndoesn't fit either of those models i'm\nsomewhere more in between and\ni know when to study for a certification\nand when to kind of just\nwander off on my own way and figure\nthings out now\num for me i kind of have like this\nframework that i apply to each lesson\nto whatever i'm learning but i'm just\ngonna use it in the context of studying\nfor certifications\ni actually wrote about this on the acg\nblog go check that out\nand if you enjoyed it could you share it\nplease and tag me\nall right anyway uh so it's kind of like\nthe seven step thing i like to call it\nmy don't\nuse study material like a netflix show\nchecklist\nfirst i'll watch any lesson or read\nwhatever chapter i'll highlight any\nconcepts that i don't understand\nsecond i will go through that list of\nconcepts that i didn't understand and\nlook them up\nthis is a great time for me to visit\nofficial documentation\nbecause you know knowing how to use\ndocumentation and how to you know\nfind what you're looking for is a good\nskill set to have three\ni'll watch the course the video the\nlesson the individual lesson or i'll\nread the chapter again but now since i\nhave this new understanding of the\nconcepts that i didn't know in the first\nplace\nthings started to click and it's pretty\nmagical feeling step four is to just do\nany on-screen demos that they're doing\nif they're running through some sort of\nexample or exercise deploying a service\nto the best of my ability\ni'll do that on my own sometimes i get\nthere sometimes i don't but it's\nadditional hands-on and especially since\nuh for example now i'm learning linux\nand i'm not doing too much hands-on\nwith that kind of stuff at work any you\nknow extra\nhelp or ways that i can get hands-on i'm\ndefinitely going to take advantage of\nthat\nso five is just the right notes you know\nbullet points just stuff that i can\nreference to\nand stuff that kind of keeps me on track\nbecause when i stop studying and i\nresume\nthe next day or the day after whatever\nit is um i know where to pick up and i\nkind of it it serves as like a refresher\nfor myself\nuh after that i'm gonna do any live labs\nor any exercises or any bonus points any\nanything\nthat they have assigned sometimes at the\nend of a chapter they'll have like bonus\npoints implement this or\num like the course i'm using on a call\nguru has\nlabs that i could use and i could do as\nwell um and i'll\ndo those so yeah that's the step six and\nthe last step is the most important one\nfor me and this might be\noptional for yourself but again i'm here\njust talking about what works for my\num and it's synthesizing my learning\nonline i'll turn my notes into a youtube\nvideo or to a blog post or\nuh you know i'll find ways to share the\nknowledge online\nand this really helps because i'm taking\nmy notes and turning it into\nlike a cohesive piece of content so it\nbuilds my technical portfolio but also\nmight help someone else out and that's\nthe reality is you might not look at\nyourself\nas a teacher but you really never know\nwho you're going to be able to help\nso that's kind of my mindset i just put\nit out there um\nyeah those are like the steps i take for\neach individual lesson\nand you might be thinking wow this might\ntake you forever to learn something if\nyou do all these things\nand yeah you're absolutely right\nstudying for my first aws cert took me\nlike\nsix months i believe and then studying\nfor the linux one um i would say cider\nback in december so about three months\nor so\nuh but it's worth it you know um i'm\nbuilding hands-on things that i can put\non my github and i'm building my\ntechnical\ncontent portfolios and and i'm you know\nresourcing resourcing researching and\nlooking things up\nin the documentation and yeah uh it's\nworth it and it's been\nquite beneficial for me uh i also know\nwhen to take breaks or when to explore\nother things right it's not always for\nme like i just have to\nlearn a certification i could go and\npick up something else like with linux\nit's super easy to want to\ngo out and just try all these open\nsource projects that are fun\nwell documented and that's what i've\nbeen doing like building modules from my\nmagic mirror\nor building a nas or deploying a ghost\nblog on\nan ubuntu server or finding open source\nor open source alternatives to all the\nprograms that i've been\nused to using and it's been great um\ni'm still studying for my next linux\ncert which is the linux foundation\ncertified system\nadministrator but i'm taking my time i'm\nreally enjoying it and i'm not forcing\nmyself to do anything again i know\nthat's because of where i am in my\ncareer and it might be different for you\nyou might have to take a cert right away\nor whatever it is uh but yeah\nthis is what works for me um one thing i\nwill say\nis there's not one course out there that\nwill 100 answer everything that you want\nit to answer you\nand it won't teach you everything but\nthis is a good thing you got to look at\nit in the way of like\nit'll get you half of the way there to\nsome extent\nobviously there are material that are\nterrible like all exam dumps are\nabsolutely terrible and you shouldn't\nuse\nbut the majority of content does teach\nyou something um\nand it's up to you if it works for you\nor not right um we all have different\nways of learning and that's why it's\nalso hard for me to recommend any study\nmaterial to anybody\nbecause what works for me may not work\nfor you but\nas long as it enables us to learn and\nwell back to myself\nas long as it enables me to get like\nsome momentum\ni can try to fill in the gaps and you\nknow go and search on search for things\nthat i don't understand\nand this is quite powerful because\noftentimes you'll be on a team that are\nthey're open to helping they're open to\nquestions but\nyou know i've also been on teams that\naren't quite as open and it sucks but\nit's a reality\nso learning how to figure things out for\nmyself has been\nuh it's been great and i think courses\nin\nstudy material do that because none of\nthem get you all the way there\nbut anyway yeah that's it for this videoi'll see you in the next video",
