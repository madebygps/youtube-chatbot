  "title": "My Effective and Simple Note Taking System",
  "transcript": "already so I'm going to show you how I\ntake notes but before I show you I want\nyou to keep two things in mind I think\nstudying from other people's notes is a\nmassive waste of time and if anything it\nmakes the process more confusing\nunderstand that the process of making\nnotes is synthesizing information in\nthat process of synthesizing is where\nyou learn you take the I don't know 10\npages you synthesize it down to\nsomething smaller one page something\nlike that but you understand it because\nyou went through the material and you\nwent and you wrote up the notes that\nwork for you if you try to go grab\nsomeone else's notes you're missing all\nthe context from where they grab the\nnotes from so I think is a poor way of\nstudying also what works for me won't\nnecessarily work for you what works for\nsomeone else will necessarily work for\nyou so if there's something here that\nyou've seen that feels valuable but it\ndoesn't work for you it doesn't mean\nthat you don't know how to study it just\nmeans that this might not work for you\nokay so keep that in mind all right so\nthere are essentially three things that\nI use I use excally draw for diagrams I\nuse notion for absolutely everything\ntext based where I'm writing things down\nand I also use pen and paper I guess\njournals and like you know handwriting\nstuff like that okay\nuh so I'll use this how Linux works as\nan example I've been writing down some\nnotes on a book that I am reading and it\nis called\nuh wait let me see where it is I have to\nbring it up how Linux works this one\nhere and right I usually have this open\non one side like this let me move this\nhere and one side like this and then\nI'll have my notion open on the left\nside and as you can see I have a page\ndepending on it really depends on how I\nwanted to break it down right so I\nwanted to go through this first chapter\nfor example the picture and then just\ntake some stuff from here and just\nreally synthesize some stuff in here so\nI kind of created a sub page for each\none of these and there's notes in here\nuh it I really don't have exactly a hard\nline as to like this is a division this\nis a title this is I need another page\nfor this I don't it's kind of just as I\ngo I like the flexibility of notion\nbecause I can just you know do\noh I want to make a H1 title oh I need\nan H2 title I can you know kind of put\nanything in there too but these are\nreally quick bullet points I don't try\nto write full on essays or blog posts or\nanything these are just quick ideas for\nme to grab from the text and later on\nwhen I read it again I can understand it\nbetter because I wrote down notes okay\nI read stuff\nthree four five times again and again\nand again I'll write notes and again\nbecause I I am just terrible I don't\nknow if I'm terrible it's just the way\nthat my brain works I have to reread\nthings multiple times in order to really\nunderstand the idea in order to\nunderstand the idea to the level that I\nwant to be able to understand it so that\nis a key for me so this one this is why\nthis is a chapter but it's taken me four\nor five days to grab all the notes that\nI wanted to uh but yeah again I have\nindividual pages so I have just sort of\nthis one page and then individual pages\nin here I have more about the file\nsystem in here I have more about uh\ndevices and I'll I'll have screenshots\nof all those kinds of things right but\nvery text based okay\nlately what I've been doing is all right\nonce I'm done with like the source\nmaterial you know I I've read through\nthis book I read through a couple blog\nposts I watch a couple videos and then I\nkind of Gap all my notes that I have\ninside of notion I've been experimenting\nand it's been working very well actually\nfor me is to use visual diagrams to\nfurther build out and synthesize the\ninformation for myself and I think this\nis also a great way for me to improve my\ncontent because in the last video that I\ndid talking about elasticity versus\nscalability me being able to explain\nsomething through a diagram was a lot\neasier for me to make my idea come\nacross than just using text or just\nusing just speaking straight here I\nthink it's a fantastic accessory so I've\nbeen sort of experimenting with that and\nI've already realized that this is a way\nbetter way for me to take notes and it\ntakes more time but it's way worth it I\nalready have so many additional ideas\nthat are coming out of these notes for\nthings that I want to learn and want to\ntalk about later on\nbut for example if we go to I have the\nwhole the whole thing here so what I\nended up doing is just coming into\nEscalade draw and essentially each one\nof those notion Pages turns into one of\nthese in like high level titles I have\none two three four and five and those\nyou can see correspond to these one two\nthree four and five pages here as well\nand we're gonna zoom in here right so I\nhave like the high level of components\nand some of these notes are actually\njust blatantly taken from my notion page\nlike if we go to here we'll see like\nokay we have oh Linux system has three\nmain levels well how do I represent that\nvisually well here we go here at three\nmain levels and then I added my notes\nthere also like oh when I'm talking\nabout the the kernel then I have like\nprocess management management and that\nis sort of similar to the information\nthat I put in where we talk about the\nkernel I think we're talking about the\nkernel in here too yeah and here so\nProcess Management memory management a\nwhole bunch of other things in here as\nwell and you get the idea I grabbed\nthese notes that I wrote down and I kind\nof speak them and as I speak them I\nwrite them through this this diagram and\nit ends up looking a lot like this now\nyou're I'm probably not gonna be able to\ndo notes like this for every single\nthing that I want to study but I just\nthought it was something that was gonna\nbe because I make this this talk that\nI'm doing about how Linux Works be a lot\nbetter so it is something that's\nbecoming very useful for me but that's\nwhat I use I highly recommend ocean I\nhighly recommend this Cali draw I use\nexcally drop rust so I pay six dollars a\nmonth for that I use notion the pro I\npaid yearly I think it was over I think\n100 or something like that but since\nthese are these tools are that I use\nevery single day I would more than\nhappily pay double the price for them\nbecause they really have changed my life\nlike I've done a couple of other things\nuh I look a lot of my architecture\ndiagrams I also do an excali draw and\nit's just worth it I love it I have an\naffiliate code for notion if you want to\nsign up for it I get a little bit of a\ncommission off of it\num but if you can also get a free\naccount there are some limitations I\nbelieve to the free account but if you\nwant to pay for a paid one you can use\nmy affiliate code and that contributes\nto continue the efforts on making this\nYouTube Channel free\nall right\nif you want to learn more about how\nLinux Works check out my talk I'll have\na link for you to register in the\ndescription I will see you in the next\nvideo",
