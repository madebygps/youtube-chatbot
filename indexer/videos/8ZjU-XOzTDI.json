  "transcript": "I I can I think I can confidently say\nthat you can escape programming a\nhundred percent again when it comes to\nselecting which one you should learn it\nshould be sort of reverse engineered\nfrom the role that you want to go for ah\nsomeone's asking me about boot camps\nyou're not going to want to hear about\nmy opinion on boot camps six figures I\nmean over like total comp is like over\ntwo hundred thousand dollars\nin an Azure job so that's why I find it\nhard to tell people to not like keep\ntheir options openGPS I've been working for 10 years with\nVM store oh VM comma storage only now I\ngot interested in Cloud which is the\nbest Target in the cloud without having\nto know a lot of programming I don't\nlike it okay\nso let's kind of reverse engineer that\nquestion the programming part if how\nmuch you actually need to program\nwill\nI I can I think I can confidently say\nthat you can escape programming a\nhundred percent\nlike okay actually maybe not programming\nyou can't escape code 100\nbecause cloud is all about Automation\nand efficiency and you can only achieve\nthat if you use some type of\nyou know language whether that be a\nprogramming language or whether that be\nuh like a scripting language or maybe\nyou're using a CLI or using an SDK and\nwhatnot right\nbut if we tell you or someone tasks you\nto go and create a VM or someone tasks\ntwo people to go and create a virtual\nmachine one person goes and creates it\nin the portal using the UI takes some I\ndon't know probably like five six\nminutes someone just does azvm create\ndash dash Resource Group provides that\nDash Dash\num\nI don't know like the image and whatnot\nand heck they even throw in a dash\ngenerate SSH keys and they can SSH right\nafter the command into it in less than\n30 seconds especially if they use that\nDash no wait parameter\nin 30 seconds like you know that's a\nmultiplier there of efficiency and time\nsaved so who do you think has a better\nopportunity of getting hired someone\nwho's more efficient or someone who has\nto do tasks manually right\nso you can't avoid\num scripting\nor you can't avoid code but that doesn't\nmean that you have to go on and learn a\nfull like programming language and know\nhow to build like websites or full\nback-ends or micro Services no no roles\nlike uh like Cloud admin solution\nArchitects uh devops Engineers sres uh\nare very very focused and very skilled\nprofessionals at utilizing Automation\nand scripting for the roles but don't\nnecessarily develop full-on applications\nnow I will also say that the thing about\nmost technical roles is that their title\nlike a devops engineer at one company\nmight actually be programming full-on\nand at a company not at all\nso also pay attention to the description\nof the role itself and see if it asks\nthat for you too\nbut I would say probably a good first\nstep would be to aim at something like a\ncloud admin or Cloud support role and\nthat gives the exposure to cloud and\nthen you kind of move up and kind of\nfigure out which Niche you want to go\nfor\nbut Cloud you can escape code that's\nkind of what it comes down to for\nSuccess code you have Version Control\nyou have a monitoring you have\num\ncicd so pipelines and whatnot\nso infrastructure is code being one of\nthose practices very important because\nagain for that same concept you don't\nhave to go manually clicking about what\nyou want to go and create for your\napplication you want that all defined\nsomewhere because you can use you know\nVersion Control for that later on you\ncan share it easily and just like a\nbunch of other options right\nterraform terraform happens to be one of\nthe more popular services or I guess\ntools to implement infrastructure as\ncode but there's a bunch of others again\nwhen it comes to selecting which one you\nshould learn it should be sort of\nreverse engineered from the role that\nyou want to go for and you kind of have\nto do research of what roles are\navailable locally and if you see like I\ndon't know 10 rules that you're\ninterested in and then the majority of\nthem are asking you for terraform learn\nterraform if the majority of them are\nasking you for\nI don't know bicep learn bicep I think\nAWS has cloud formation or something\nlike that\nnot 100 sure but of the naming for other\nclouds but\nyeah\nthat's why it's important to learn\ninfrastructure as code do you need\nMicrosoft 365 for being a cloud engineer\nin Microsoft Azure I was told yes but\nI've never heard about it yet what I\nwill say is that a lot of\num companies that use through 365 they\nthey\ntend to lean the Hat leaning into having\nsome sort of azure presence\nso if you kind of think of 365 of being\na skill set that will sort of be like a\nGateway into exposure to Azure because\nof that then I think that is an\ninteresting skill set\nand something to do there's also a lot\nof automation that you can do with 365\nlike think of like creating users and\naccesses and access to specific services\nand whatnot like you'll use Powershell\nor and or other tools to automate that\nkind of thing\nso just because it's not specifically\nazure\nit doesn't mean that it's not Cloud\nexposure right I'm getting into WGU\ncloud computing I don't know what route\nto go either AWS or Azure they have a\ncombined one that holds both\nprobably the easiest way to decide is to\njust see what's more popular in your\narea or maybe give both a try like you\ncan get free\nfree\ncredits when you sign up for a new\naccount and see which one you like more\nthat's a good thing about being at the\nbeginning is like you can you're sort of\nfiguring out where you want to invest\nyour knowledge because Cloud what I've\nlearned is\nlike when I started learning cloud it\nwas very specific to Azure functions and\nonce I became somewhat proficient with\nAzure functions it was kind of easy to\nlearn other services through that\nservice and I tend to see that\nthat happens a lot with my Cloud\nLearning like and then I I sort of\nevolved like a chain of services\num like I learned a lot of Cosmos DB\nbecause of azure functions I learned key\nVault because of functions recently I've\nbeen learning like a lot of bicep\nbecause of deploying functions and just\nyou know so you see how you kind of sort\nof build this web of services that you\nend up\num knowing through like one service\nbut when you're at the very beginning\nyou're sort of kind of deciding where do\nI even start so you kind of have all\nthese options and wanna\nso figuring out like what's the best for\nyour Market might be a good way or maybe\njust downright what you like to do more\nwhat projects would you recommend for\nsomeone getting into devops so the cool\nthing about devops is any project will\ndo because every project will need you\nto implement cicd Version Control\nmonitoring and whatnot not absolutely\nevery project is going to need\ncontainers and orchestration of course\nnot but I think at the bare minimum\nevery project should have Version\nControl something like git and GitHub\nand then I pipeline something like\nGitHub actions and then infrastructures\ncode so something like terraform\nthe first project I highly recommend\npeople do in general for just cloud or\ndevops is the cloud resume challenge\nthere are now challenges for that\nspecific type of project and every\nsingle Cloud I built the one in Azure\nand you can find an hour and a half\ntutorial on YouTube if you just search\nfor Azure Cloud resume\nso once you have that build all the\ndevops practices in addition to that\nproject\nand then you can go to I don't know any\nother ones off the top of my head\nbecause I created learn to cloud.guide\nand there's a project section there and\nI just list them there there's a bunch\nmore there that you can take a look at\nbut devops is like you don't have to\ncome up with ideas from scratch\nhit your best what are your thoughts on\na six-month Cloud boot camp apparently\nthe program has made a reputation for\nthemselves people who have gotten jobs\nwith no Cloud experience so just from\nsome context I don't like boot camps\nbecause\nfrom all the research that I've done\nthey said they seem to be anywhere from\nten thousand dollars to about twenty\nthirty thousand dollars\nthey say that they can teach you all\nthese things in a certain amount of time\nand then there's sort of some like job\nguarantee or something like that a lot\nof them do a very interesting like oh\nyou don't pay but we get a portion of\nyour salary it's just like stuff like\nthat that I find\nI don't know\nI just feel like a lot of them sell\ndreams and a lot of them have been shown\nand proven to uh not actually\nyou know come through with what they're\npromising\num\nfrom the like Creator standpoint I know\na lot of influencers out there will\nrecommend boot camps but it's because\nthey get a cut of it\num that's why you'll never see me\nrecommending those things because I\ndon't ever want to\nput my reputation on something that I\nhaven't personally gone through\nI also think that just boot camps are\nways of like I understand people having\nan urgency for wanting to get into Tech\nto get a better salary or things or\nwhatnot buteven if you land a role with the boot\ncamp or whatnot your ability to be\nself-taught is something that you're\ngoing to have to work on at any point\nand sort of finding\nlike how to teach yourself like the\nsooner you can do that the better\nif people sort of take that initiative\nearlier on like once you're in your role\nyou're going to be able to teach\nyourself absolutely anything but I\nunderstand sometimes people need guided\nlearning and wanna I just don't like\nschemes I guess\nso\nthat's why and I truly do believe that\nif you go if you have like a year of\nsupport or a year of some sort of\nentry-level tech tech role and then you\nspend six months just\ndoing the ultimate sacrifice of just\nstudying and learning and building that\nyou can land uh a cloud adjacent role if\nnot a cloud role entry-level role in\nthat amount of time\nit the caveat is having entry-level\nexperience but support roles are very\nentry level friendly\nI know because I did it so and I know\nbecause I know a bunch of other people\ndid\nI'd match I would much rather go through\nthat approach because you know in your\nsupport role you're still making money\nyou're not paying right versus you know\ngetting into 20 30 grand a debt because\nof a boot camp\ncan you give a real life use case of why\nwe need to use kubernetes when an\napplications are dockerized and deployed\nin the cloud could you suggest some good\nlearning resources\ncan you talk to me a little bit about\nthe application\nso because if you have just\nkubernetes is orchestration\nso if you have one container one\napplication it's just one container and\nyou're not necessarily dealing with\nmicroservices then you don't need\nkubernetes\nI it there's there's not necessarily A\nHard number but when that that sort of\nlike updating your containers uh and\nsort of maintaining everything in the\nstate that it needs to be\nand then you're talking about stores and\njust all these additional components and\nwhatnot that are part of your containers\nthat become so sort of hectic to\norchestrate that's when you need to\nthrow in something like kubernetes\nbut I recently saw this video\nthat was called you don't need\nkubernetes which I thought was\nfascinating and this person was taking\nthe approach of like there are very\nlittle applications these days that you\ncan't use serverless for which\nI tend to agree\num so just people tend to over\ncomplicate things just because they want\nto have containers just because they\nwant to have\num\nkubernetes just I don't know for\nwhatever reason big Tech can afford it\nbecause you know infinite amount of\nmoney they can throw money at containers\nand kubernetes and whatnot but with\nCloud there's all these other services\nthat you could take that are meant for\nyou to sort of\nwork sort of in a consumption\nmodel so like why not I've seen way more\nAWS related jobs and I've seen Azure\nthat are out there but it's not nearly\nthe same amount people tend to say that\na lot\num like yeah you're not going to find an\nAzure job but here I am making six\nfigures I mean over like total comp is\nlike over two hundred thousand dollars\nin an Azure job so that's why I find it\nhard to tell people to not like keep\ntheir options open\nand even before I was working on\nMicrosoft\nI was working at an Azure shop\nthat was making 55k 75k and whatnot so\nthey are out there absolutely and you\nmight happen to be in an area where that\nis just the demand is just Azure the\ndemand is gcp the demand is Oracle the\ndemand it's like what not so blatantly\ntelling someone you have to learn AWS\nit's not the best advice the best advice\nthat I give is go and do the research\nput in the work to understand what your\nMarket looks like or if you're looking\nmore for remote jobs and like go and\nlook for the rules that you're\ninterested in and then use that\ndescription as sort of like yours your\nstudy guide and kind of reverse engineer\nwhat you need to learn from there uh\nwhat were the middle rule between\nservice desk and devops solution\narchitect okay so first of all you put\ndevops slash solution architect those\nare completely different roles\ncompletely different roles and I don't\nthink solution architect is a very\nentry-level role for entry level\nfriendly role so you got to First figure\nout what your the actual next step for\nyou you want to be\nI I pretty much tell people service desk\nso support then goes this admin Network\nadmin or something like that\num and the goal is to kind of increase\nthe role and the exposure that you have\nto Cloud a lot of roles that give you\nexposure to Cloud won't necessarily have\ncloud in the title so pay attention more\nto descriptions As you move up in your\ncareer and you can specialize and become\nmore and more Niche then you know you\nknow then you're going to end up with a\ntitle like Cloud devsec MLL ml Ops or\nwhatnot and whatnot but that doesn't\nstart when you're kind of you know you\ndon't have that when you're getting\nstarted and one so it's more about that\ndescription and whatnot\num\nyeah so if you kind of think of it if\nlike the more I can do automation the\ncloser I get to cloud in a way\num says admins do a lot of that that\nwould be a good sort of Middle Ground\nbetween support and then cloud or devops\nGPS you have any laptop recommendations\nif I want to start learning using Linux\nuh yeah so I would say first of all you\nprobably don't need a new laptop just to\nventure into Linux if later on you want\nto make Linux like your main machine\nyour main operating system then yeah\nabsolutely but you can do things like if\nyou have a Windows laptop and there are\nsome requirements that this laptop needs\nto meet but you can go and you know do\nyour research on that but you can use\nsomething like WSL and you'll have not a\nnative Linux experience but you'll have\nsomething that's close enough that I\nthink is to start learning Linux you\ncould also have like virtual machines uh\nthings like parallels or virtual blocks\nwhere you can have like a virtual\nversion of Linux on your machine you can\nalso deploy a VM into the cloud some\nfree tiers will allow you to use up to\ncertain amount of time\nuh for VM so I would say first give that\na shot if then you're fully fully\nconvinced I mean there's so many laptops\nout there like the my favorite all-time\nlaptop that I use Linux on was this\nlaptop called the HP omen\nand I remember I and I used to use that\nas I think I had like dual booted so I\nwould have Windows and Linux on that\nand I would game on that I used to\nstream on that do you all I don't know\nif anyone's been watching my channel but\nlike when I first started I used to like\nplay Tony Hawk I would do these like\nCloud these kind of sessions right but I\nwould play Tony Hawk while answering\nthose questions\num\nand I would have like two people\nwatching but the the impressive thing\nwas like this laptop was capable of\nhaving that and it had like a 1660 TI\nand it was like a great machine and I\nthink I paid like a hundred a thousand\nUSD for it so the value in the capacity\nwas so great and then eventually I\nturned it into a full just I used pop OS\non it what I'm trying to say is like you\ndon't need a super powerful laptop to\nrun any kind of Linux OS that you want\non it so there's so many options out\nthere currently in it support specialist\ntoo hold Linux LPI\nuh oh that's that's my favorite\ncertification of all time the Linux the\nLinux Essentials AWS CCP build-based\nproject was the ec2 VPC Lambda terraform\nshould I shoot straight to devops\nengineer or more a junior collateral\nI've been working to help This 1.2 years\nhelp me okay so\njust to straight up answer your question\nshould I shoot straight for devops in\ngeneral more of a junior shoot for any\nrole so if you meet if you feel like you\nmeet 50 of the requirements go okay that\nshould answer your question now in terms\nof the way you're speaking about your\nskill set you're saying that you've\nbuilt basic projects with ec2 VPC Lambda\nand terraform make sure when you do get\nthese like interviews that you're not\nspeaking to them in that way that you're\nspeaking in end results right it's more\nso like I built an automation system\nthat does this and then you can dive\ninto the details but if you're just\ntelling me like oh I built a project\nwith easy two well that literally just\nsays all you've been all you use is\nvirtual machines like I don't really\nknow much more of your skill set than\nthat right\num I have a video on my channel that's\ncalled the serverless project that got\nme promoted and I sort of talk a little\nbit more so like the people who hire you\nthe people who promote you\nuh aren't always the ones who have like\nthe most technical knowledge or\ngenerally they just don't really care\nnecessarily about the individual's skill\nset it's more so like results and like\nwhat like you can produce and whatnot so\nif you can speak to them about your\ntechnical skill set in a way that sort\nof really resonates with them then\nthat's when you get that connection of\nlike oh this is someone that we should\ncontinue to look into for this\ninterviewing process so make sure you\nyou know tailor your resume tailor your\ncover letter and then you're also\npracticing those interviewing skills and\nbeing able to speak to your projects is\nvery very important",
