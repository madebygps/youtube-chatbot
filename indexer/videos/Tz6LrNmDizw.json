  "transcript": "so i started off by\nusing this course lpic 101\ncourse on a cloud guru disclaimer i when\ni was studying for the certification\ni was working at a cloud guru so i had\nfree access to their entire catalog\nand they also paid for the certification\nso i sort of just went with\nof course i was available on there\nbecause one it was free and two it was\nsort of like the quickest like oh\ni work here why not like take a look at\nwhat we've got uh but i quickly realized\nthat video content isn't really the way\ni learn which i know is ironic because i\nhave a youtube channel\ncreating technical tutorials\nbut yeah here we are uh so i followed\nthe course it's there was nothing wrong\nwith the material itself i just can't\nlearn following video because i was\ndoing like the practice exams like that\nthey have included in in\nthe course and nothing was just sticking\nlike i feel like i was just memorizing\nthings\npersonally i don't like to just memorize\ni think that it's just a waste of time\nand that is the reason why i don't have\nmany certifications i literally have az\n900\nlpi essentials and then aws certified\ndeveloper\nwith associate which is expired and i\nthink the az900 is expired as well\nand i don't plan on renewing\nthe linux one either uh so yeah nothing\nwas really sticking uh so then i i went\nout and i i got these two books one is\ncalled linux basic basics for hackers\nand the other one is the linux command\nline and i essentially followed\nthe entire linux basics for hackers book\nand then i used the linux command line\none as a reference\nso whenever there were commands that i\ndidn't fully understand after reading a\nchapter\nin the first book i would use the\ncommand line book as a reference i'd go\nlook up the command i wouldn't i didn't\nread that from end to end i would just\nlook up the command to get more examples\nand hands-on\nlike exercises and things like that it\nwas great\nso my schedule was like\ni think this was like january into\nfebruary of last year\ni sat down eight in the morning i\nstudied until 10 a.m\nso i would read the chapter and then get\nnotes but i wouldn't synthesize them\nuntil the evening so the evening would\ncome out come around and then i would\nactually write a blog post which is like\na neat version of the notes that i took\nearlier in the day and i did this for\nabout a month\nthen i took the exam and it passed\num if you go to madebygps.com and you\nhit on the linux tag you're going to see\nall my linux notes there so the linux\nessentials exam objectives\nand like topic one is like very theory\nbased\nand so is i think there's a couple of\nother sections here\nfor example i think it's like topic like\ntopic four like choosing an operating\nsystem like that's and understanding\ncomputer hardware\nwhoops my girlfriend is calling yeah\nokay not bad all right so like i was\nsaying uh topic four you have some stuff\nthat's like pretty theory based that you\ngotta look up like operating system\nstuff\nuh understanding computer hardware\nbut then this here\nunderstanding the different directories\nand utilities and data stores and stuff\nlike that\nthe book will i think i learned that in\nthe book\nsome networking stuff also learned\ntopic five uh security\nuser groups\npermissions ownership\nand special directories and topic i\nthink i skipped over here like topic two\nand\nyeah\nthose two i learned also in the book\nand then topic one is pretty theory\nbased as well i believe\nup until around yeah i think so i think\na lot of this is just very theory based\nokay so to summarize that\none theory based\njust googled it uh\ntwo i learned from the book\nthree i learned from the book\nfor\nsome theory\nand some from the book\nthis part two and then five from the\nbook\nso yeah\nit covers pretty much everything\nbut i'm not telling you that the book is\na linux essentials\nbook\nlike it doesn't follow the curriculum\nbut you learn the basics of linux which\nwould make sense that the linux\nessential certification is asking you\nfor that uh i don't have links go look\nup these books i'm not i don't have\naffiliate links because i don't want\nyour money i feel like people are going\nto ask me if i recommend a cloud guru\ni only used it because it was available\nto me i don't really have an opinion on\nthem now\ni don't use them now so that's my i\nguess\nanswer\nall right\ni'll see in the next video",
