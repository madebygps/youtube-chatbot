  "transcript": "so there's sort of this\nfamous saying that you're not supposed\nto stay in a job for more than two years\nat tech\ni don't necessarily agree\nbut i think it's a good guideline\nso for example\nearlier on my career a year and a half\nwas around the sort of sweet spot for me\nit was enough time for me to become very\ncomfortable with my skill set but also\nenough time for me to not feel like i'm\ngetting too comfortable or bored at work\nso help desk a year and a half my\nsysadmin and then cloud engineer gig\nwas almost two years a little over\na year and a half i think somewhere in\nthe middle between those two and now\nmicrosoft i'm about i'm over a year at\nmy current role but i\ndon't i still don't feel like i'm\ncomfortable here\nin in my current role so it might take\nme a little bit more time to get to that\nspot where i'm like oh i want to see\nwhat's next for me um\nso for me definitely a year and a half\nor so is\nsort of my sweet spot in terms of like\nokay let me figure out what my next\nsteps are\ntwo years i could also see that being\napplicable especially in this current\nrole for myself\nanything less than a year i think could\npotentially be a little tricky but i\nunderstand people leave jobs in roles\nearlier than a year for a bunch of\nreasons\ni think the absolute earliest that i've\never left a role is six months like my\ngig at acg\nsix months in i left but i only left\nbecause the conditions to join this job\nat microsoft were just everything was\naligned and it was the role i wanted and\neverything so i had to go for it\nbut you know when you think of like\nthink of your first year at a roll\nyou're spending about three months\nwith um onboarding and whatnot let's\nconsider another month of like i don't\nknow vacation\nholidays\nuh i don't know\ntime that you're not in the role for\nwhatever reason and then there's only uh\nwhat's that four months total so there's\nonly eight months left of the year for\nyou to really have time to own your\nskill set in your current role so that's\nwhy i think in less than a year you're\nreally not giving yourself enough time\nto\nknow absolutely everything that you can\nof the role and that way you can you\nknow take that that skill set and\nshowcase it into another interview or\ninto a next role or make your case for a\npromotion or whatnot all those kinds of\nthings um\nyeah but that's my opinion and it's sort\nof what has worked great for me i would\nlove to hear other people's experiences\nand sort of what framework and what\nmindset do they have when they're\nthinking about okay what's my current\nrelationship with my role and where do i\nwant to take it next or when do you\nstart failing that way because it's a\nquestion that i get a lot and i would\npersonally like to hear from all of\ny'all\nso yeah super short video but\nthat's my insight on that i will see you\nin the next one",
