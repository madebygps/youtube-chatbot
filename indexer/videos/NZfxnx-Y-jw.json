  "transcript": "hi everyone today we are going to be\ntalking about boot camps and if I\nbelieve they are worth it and who they\nactually are worth going through I'm not\n100 anti-boot camp but I do have some\nstrong opinions in this space and with\nall that being said hi I'm GPS and\nwelcome to a new video let's switch back\ninto the how to get a cloud job diagram\nif you want a high resolution of this\ndiagram I think I price it at like ten\ndollars or something like that or you\ncould just pause the video and take a\nscreenshot but if you want to support\nthe channel and help me avoid sponsors\nand help me avoid talking about random\nvpns and during the Middle videos uh go\nand get yourself a copy of this diagram\nso we'll talk about someone who's in\nprereq land which is essentially where I\nget a lot of these our bootcamps worth\nof questions from\nuh let's let's say we have a someone who\nis making at the moment 60k in a\ndifferent field and they want to shift\ninto Cloud but they have a bunch of\nfactors maybe they have family maybe\nthey have parents that take care of\nwhatever it is where they can't make\nless than 60k but they want to make the\nshift into cloud and usually what I\nrecommend most people is do a year in a\nsupport type role and upskill in that\nyear and then in two years you could be\nover here in the cloud exposure land\nwhich the majority of these roles you're\nfinding are going to be\n60 60k and above but those entry level\nAttack rules you know some of them can\nbe like Kev Tech shout out kevtech just\ntold me about I helped us roll in New\nYork City that's 150 000 base salary so\nthere are some of those fluke rules out\nthere but generally I would say\nthese entry-level Tech roles are\nprobably going to be around that or less\nuh so if you have you know if you're\nsomeone who for whatever reason is it\ncould be a bunch of factors can't go\nthrough this the space here and you want\nto accelerate through it I would say a\nboot camp is worth it if you find a boot\ncamp that is\n100 upfront and honest like you can pop\nthat they have publicly the amount that\nit costs you don't have to go through\nmultiple uh like like Zoom calls or\nanything like that like up front you can\nsee how much it costs that way you can\nmake you know sit down make your budget\nsee financially it's going to work for\nyou\ntwo if they have a lot of public reviews\ntestimonials and things like that three\nif they have their curriculum that's\npublic uh\nI haven't found a boot camp that hits\nall these things that I feel like I\nwould need to know before I could be\ncomfortable going through a boot camp\nbut I think you also don't have to\nexpect to get the best\ncontent I don't I don't think boot camps\nare worth it from the learning\nperspective I think they are only worth\nit from their connections that they can\nbring in and if you you can essentially\nput yourself through a three-month\nprogram or yeah some I think the\nmajority of them are three to six months\nthree to six month program paying I\nthink I've seen anywhere from like 15\n000 to up to thirty thousand dollars you\nknow paying that a money amount of money\nuh putting yourself through through the\nprogram\nand you know you end up and they will\nessentially guarantee you a job or they\nhave connections for so you can land\nthat job I think it's worth it there\nI've yet to see a boot camp like that\nwhich is why I overall just don't\ngenerally enjoy them but I don't think\nthe instruction the content or anything\nlike that that the majority of them have\nis any unique I think everything that\nyou need to learn you can essentially\nlearn on your own and we'll talk about\nthat a little bit\nbut\nyeah if you if you can accelerate\nthrough it pay this fee essentially\naccelerate through it and then leverage\ntheir connections to land a role then it\ncould be worth it if you can't stomach\nthe\nthe the year to two years again I say\ntwo years Max but I realistically do\nbelieve that people can get through this\nphase in a year a year to two years in\nin this phase of you know entry level\nattack role and teaching yourself\nfor everyone else I really don't think\nboot camps are worth it I don't see how\nthey don't have unique unique\nuh curriculums they don't really have\nunique ways of teaching or anything like\nthat but I think the the biggest one\nthat I\nI can like the biggest point for me is\nthe earlier you can teach yourself how\nto learn a new concept\nthe the better your the rest of your\ncareer is going to develop into because\nyou know you you go to school or you you\ngo to a boot camp or whatever and\nessentially you get your foot in the\ndoor\nbut that's just like the first step\nthen when you need to go and you want to\ngo for a promotion you want to switch\ninto another role you want to search\ncompanies you're gonna have to teach\nyourself and throughout the entire time\nyou're gonna have to teach yourself as\nwell the other you learn how to do it\nthe the you know you're just going to be\nbetter off\nI think another big thing to kind of\nkeep in mind is that the the\nfundamentals of cloud computing the\nfundamentals of of Landing a role in\nCloud are so publicly available like\nlearner cloud is available but there's\nalso so many course makers out there so\nmany teachers out there who you know\nhave their courses for I want to say on\naverage less than a hundred dollars and\nthey have like professional experience\nbacking up uh the the content that they\nare delivering\nthey and they're like much more\naffordable they're much more at your\npace uh I mean the mentality is at your\npace and it's just so\npublicly obvious what you need to learn\nso really the hardest part is finding\nthe discipline and scheduling in that\ntime but again the earlier you can do\nthat the better off you are going to be\nfor the rest of your career\nand we can't deny the the aspect of how\nmuch money they cost\nI think the cheapest one I did some\nresearch on this but the cheapest one I\nsaw I seen was ten thousand and it was\nfor a three month Pro and a 90-day\nprogram and it was essentially just\ncontent no like job guarantee or\nanything like that but ten thousand\ndollars for Content that wasn't unique\nfor curriculum so aren't unique for I\ncan't really say on the instructors\nbecause I didn't really see them\ndelivering anything\nbut everything is so publicly available\nfor her\nfor you that I just don't see how it's\nworth it\ninstead of spending the money on\ngoing because I have nothing against\nspending money to learn but you can\nspend it on a bunch of courses from\nIndividual course makers independent\ncourse makers you could spend it on\nsubscriptions to things like a cloud\nGuru or plural site or there's a bunch\nof other academic platforms out there\nyou can\nyou know spend money on actually putting\nyou know paying for your your Azure\nsubscription like put yourself a 20\nminute 20 minute a 20 budget every month\nthat is more than enough I I showed\neveryone on the Stream\nI think it was two three weeks ago that\nmy my Azure resume which is probably one\nof the most the ones I get like one of\nthe most traffic because it's the\nexample in the video\nis costing me like 11 a month uh I know\na year to run so putting in that money a\nmonth is is\nway more worth it than paying for\nthe the boot camp in my opinion\nBut ultimately it does come down to\nwhatever people want to do if you feel\nlike a boot camp is worth it then go for\nit I just feel like learning\non your own pace tenfold just paste 10\nfull you you\nput that money back into\nother educational resources into your\nown cloud accounts and subscriptions and\nthings like that and you're gonna be\ngood\nbut yeah that's how I feel about that\nand\nI'll see you in the I want to know your\nopinion again this is all my opinion\num but leave it in the comments below\nand I'll see in the next one",
