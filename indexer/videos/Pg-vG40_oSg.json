  "title": "3 Financial Literacy Resources That Changed My Life",
  "transcript": "let's first let me first give you my\nfinancial context because I feel like a\nlot of people fail to provide that\ninformation when they want to give out\nsome Financial advice or some\nrecommendations on Financial Resources\nbecause the impact that a financial\nresource can have on my life will be\nmuch different than yours if we have\nvery different Financial\nexperiences or relationships or whatever\nyou want to call it right so for example\nI have no debt so maybe uh some advice\non saving or investing will have a\ndifferent impact on me than it will have\non you because your priority might be to\nwork on that debt and since I don't have\nthe two then you know that's different\nright so for context\nI have no dependence so all my income is\nfor myself I don't have a mortgage I\nlive in New York City and I rent I don't\nhave any significant debt the most\namount of debt I've ever had was\nprobably when I financed a 100 gram I\nthink it was around like thirty five\nfour thousand dollars so I've never had\nmore debt than that uh I've always sort\nof kept a lifestyle where I've spent\nless than\nuh I've made and that's been ever since\nI started like looking into Financial\neducation so this was2017-ish 2018.\nmaybe a little bit before that right but\nprior to that I've always been just oh\nthe concept is to save to save to save\nto save to save right so anyway that's\nthe context there so the First Resource\nI want to show you all is called this\nbook called I will teach you to be rich\nLet's go to the cover I will teach you\nto be rich it's by Remy Sethi I see this\nbook as a framework I read all the\nchapters and there are some chapters\nthat don't apply to me but the the whole\nconcept is like\nFinance doesn't need to be this thing\nthat you over complicate yourself you\ncan\nsort of build a system for yourself that\njust works and you don't have to like be\ntinkering with it every single week and\nthat so\nthat's why it starts off like would you\nrather be sexy or Rich like do you want\nlike a super sophisticated and complex\nFinancial uh framework for yourself or\ndo you want just something that'll make\nyou money long term so that's how the\nbook of sets itself up\nbut I understood how to take advantage\nof the benefits that my credit card\nprovides and I looked into other credit\ncard options and I know I opened up an\naccount with a different company after I\nread this\nuh I opened up a high yield savings\naccount because of this book also I\nlearned how to optimize my 401k and I\nopened up a Roth IRA oh that's another\nthing I work a nine to five so I don't\nhave my own business or anything like\nthat so that is different that might be\ndifferent for other people too so that\nwhy this is advice might work for me\nmight not work for you whatever right so\nthat's important as well\num\noh conscious spending big part I used to\nworry a lot about like often buying\nmaybe small things or I would perhaps\nlet myself from buying I don't know like\na book or video game that was maybe 20\n40 or something like that but when it\ncame to like these massive items like I\ndon't know a TV or something like that\nlike I wouldn't\nlike I for somehow would justify\nspending a significant amount of money\nversus like small so that relationship I\nwas able to further understand because\nof this chapter of conscious spending I\nlike that\nand then under say while you're sleeping\nwas all about sort of like how you can\nautomate your system and that way you\ndon't have to like worry about it\nbecause I don't know about y'all but if\nI have to worry about what I'm doing\nwith every single paycheck I feel like\nit's very overwhelming and also just a\nwaste of time whereas you can automate\nthese things right\nso and anyway there's a bunch of other\nchapters in here that I really I really\ndid enjoy uh so I highly recommend you\nlooking into it I would say this book\ndoesn't dive deep into any aspect but it\ngives you enough information like a\nprimer and enough information for you to\ngo and explore further\nafter this book I read the Motley Fool\ninvestment guide I found the Motley Fool\nI think through a podcast and I really\nliked just the way that they would\nexplain and talk about\nfinancial news week to week so then they\nhad mentioned like oh we have the\ninvestment guidebook if you want to have\na like understanding of what investing\nactually is\nand because at that time I was already\nin a situation where the money that I\nmade was enough for me to fund my 401k\nmy Roth my savings cover all my bills\nand I had money left over so I wanted to\nlearn more about investing\noutside of like 401k and retirement\naccounts in general so yeah Molly fool\ninvestment guide it's great it gives you\nlike a high level\nuh overview and of it's pretty easy read\ntoo of just different concepts like the\nstock market different types of stocks\ndifferent types of investing it's more\nfor the person who wants Like the quote\nboring type of investing like you want\nto make uh gains long term and you're\nnot trying to day trade you're not\ntrying to you know yeah long-term\ninvesting I highly recommend it\nbut if you don't want a paid resource\nthough these books are not expensive I\nthink they were like 20 or something\nlike yeah each one if you go to this\nwebsite this website is something that I\nprobably check\nmore like I've read those two books and\nsometimes when I do need to reference\nsomething that was covered in this book\nI'll go reread them\nbut Investopedia is a website that I\nlook for all the time like I was just in\nhere if you go to the education tab it\nhas like all these Concepts that you can\nlearn a lot more about I was just\nchecking out the Roth IRA because I'm my\nmom wants to open one up so I was\nreading about this again\nand I remember using this website\nalongside the books\nit's sort of like when\nI was reading the Linux for hackers book\nto learn\nyou know Linux and Bash and then I was\nusing the Linux command line book as\nsort of an additional reference like\nthere was a command and then like for\nHacker's book that was covered but I\nwanted to learn more about it I would\nuse the Linux command line book so a\nsimilar relationship here or I was using\nthe I will teach you how to be rich and\nthe investment guide and whenever there\nwas Concepts that I wanted to learn a\nlittle bit more about I would come into\nvistapedia look up the concept and then\njust read that page it's all free they\nhave paid resources as well I haven't\nreally used those so no recommendations\nthere but the like there's just so much\nin here any concept you can think of in\nterms of investing Finance in general is\nhere highly recommend it\nall right that's it uh really it's all I\nuse sometimes I'll go on YouTube but I\ndon't really have any YouTubers that I\ncan 100 recommend I feel like these\nbooks covered everything that I needed\nand finance is something that I feel\nlike I have a good handle on now it also\ntakes time I'll say that give yourself\ntime like just because you read these\ndoesn't mean like immediately you're\ngonna\nhave a system that works for you and\noftentimes you still will need to Tinker\nwith it\num you know your life will change so\nyour financial situations will also\nchange alongside with it uh but yeah\nthis is what works for me\nand has taught me everything that I need\nto know\nand that's it hopefully there's\nsomething useful here for you",
