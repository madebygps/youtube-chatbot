  "transcript": "today we are going to be talking about\nhow I spent my monthly salary and just\nfor context I'm single so no dependents\nno spouse and I rent in New York so\ncrazy taxes crazy uh cost of life and\nwhatnot here I don't have any debt\nwhatsoever so like no car uh payments no\nmortgages no school loans nothing I have\nlike 450 and whatnot on a credit card\nbut that's it so my financial framework\nworks for me but I don't necessarily\nthink this would work for everybody and\nI don't want anyone to take any of this\nas advice this is more so just hey if\nyou're looking for kind of ideas of how\nother people manage their money this is\nmy example of that so uh because I live\nin New York and because I'm single and\nbecause I file as I'm single and whatnot\nI\na good amount of my money gets taken out\nfor taxes and then also 401K\ncontributions and whatnot so I make\nabout 1400 1400 500 14 500 ish and then\nI take home about 9 200 9 300 and what\nnot\nand again that that chunk there is taxes\nand 401K contributions after that I\nmanually move about four thousand five\nhundred anywhere from four thousand to\nabout four thousand five hundred dollars\nto different accounts so I have two high\nyield savings accounts one is for my\nlike three months emergency fund so that\nshould be rent and expenses for three\nmonths that's there and then I have one\nfor savings\njust like saving towards like a major\nper um purchase or whatnot at the moment\nit's my house well it's the house that I\nwant to buy so manifesting my house\num so this 4 000 ish whatever amount it\nis that I I invest or I take to invest\nor save like that split depends on where\nI'm at in life and like how much I want\nto save and how much I want to invest at\nthe moment the split is around 3 000\nsaving and then a thousand and investing\nor a thousand five hundred into\ninvesting but it wasn't always the case\nI only recently a couple months ago\ndecided like hey I really do want to buy\na house so I've been changing up the uh\nthe framework there but yeah that's the\nbiggest one in terms of like my\ninvesting it's boring it's you know this\nwhole concept of um time in Market over\ntiming the market that's kind of it I\nread this in like investing books uh I\nread one by like the Motley Fool I can't\nremember it's like a blue book I can't\nremember what it's called and then I\nread this book called\num I will teach you how to be rich and\nthen those kind of helped me put\ntogether my sort of financial framework\nbut yeah uh it's really boring ETFs and\nfunds like that's it I just grab a fixed\namount and I add it to the account every\nother week\nthat's kind of it\num after that like that's kind of like\nmy biggest expense and this whole idea\nof like\npaying myself first which was a concept\nthat I got from that book I will teach\nyou how to be rich and I like the idea\nof like as soon as my money hits it goes\nto my own accounts like I'm not like\nfirst like paying bills and whatnot and\nI know I'm only in that situation\nbecause you know I don't have kids I\ndon't have major debt and all these\nkinds of things so I'm very much very\ngrateful and whatnot but I'm also trying\nto be like smart like I don't want to be\nlike as soon as my\nmy money hits like oh I can go buy this\nor I can go get this I'm like no like\nlike pay yourself first kind of concept\nobviously how someone would pay\nthemselves first and what that looks\nlike for them is different but this is\nwhat I do for myself\nafter that my next biggest expense is\nrent two thousand five hundred dollars I\nlive in New York yes I know I could buy\na house down South for with five\nbedrooms for this amount of money I\nunderstand but where I'm at in life I\nreally should enjoy living in New York\nso\nyeah I I can I can put up that amount of\nmoney for rent here for now it's not\ngonna be like that forever I don't think\nNew York is the place where I would want\nto raise a kid and have a family one not\nbut for now I like it I like the social\nlife and those the things that being in\nNew York has brought to my social life\num so for now it's amount of money I pay\nafter this I spent about uh anywhere\nfrom like 700 to even up to a thousand\ndollars and I'm ashamed to say this but\nfor social well-being in terms of like\nany extracurricular activities I want to\ndo if I want to go off I want to uh go\nto a bar if I want if I have to take\nUbers because it's too late too early\nwhatsoever flights to somewhere fun to\ntravel somewhere if I want to spend a\nweekend somewhere if I wanna\num you know I don't know get a meal\nsomewhere go to like I don't know fancy\nrestaurant or or take my partner out on\na date or what not anything like\nanything that's for my social well-being\num also like books uh any any of these\npurchases will go under that bucket\nanywhere from like 700 to like a\nthousand dollars I do want to be smarter\nwith that amount of money uh but for now\nI'm like I think all my life I've been\njust like so strict so strict with like\noh don't spending money save save save\nsave then now I'm trying to\nyou know kind of like enjoy the hard\nwork and whatnot um I think you know\nyour parents influence on your\nrelationship with money is big and like\nsomething that they don't really teach\nyou in school to like how to you know\nmanage money or whatnot so I had to\nteach all these things for me so I had\nto kind of remove the the mindset of\nlike oh if you have money you should\nsave it and not do absolutely anything\nelse that kind of was kind of like\ninstilled in me from my parents\num so yeah trying to enjoy it a little\nmore like this month I bought myself an\niPad\nuh with that budget uh but it's great\nbecause I can have all my like\num you know Linux books and and whatnot\non here yeah like I read like\num a lot on this and it's really nice to\njust be able to take it everywhere like\nI was reading some Cosmos DB stuff on\nhere too earlier today for this project\nthat I'm working on\num but yeah\nso anyway that's the third biggest\nexpense I see and then after that I have\na couple like smaller ones uh groceries\nabout 300 400 a month I probably want to\nincrease this just a little bit more\nthat and then decrease the social\nwell-being one so instead of going out\nas much as I do to eat be home and cook\nmore meals and whatnot that would also\nbe better for my physical and health and\nwhatnot uh then I have like internet\nabout 150 phone bill 100 fifty dollars\nuh electricity bill about 150 as well\nwow a lot of these are like 150 large\nand whatnot\num then I have like subscriptions Adobe\nYouTube Spotify stream Labs each one of\nthese are anywhere from like 10 to 20\ndollars\nand then I pay my editor anywhere from\n100 to 200 a month depending on how much\nwork and what we're working on that\nmonth and whatnot\nso yeah that's uh really how I spend my\nmoney uh I don't want anyone to take\nthis as advice more so just take it as\nan example\num but yeah there's there's one piece of\nadvice I would say is\nthere's so so many books out there that\nyou can read\num to like really understand about money\nand how you can be smarter with it but\nread a couple of them don't just read\none and be like this is absolutely like\nthe Bible when it comes to money and\nwhatnot because everyone's situation is\ndifferent all right\nthat's it I'll see in the next video",
