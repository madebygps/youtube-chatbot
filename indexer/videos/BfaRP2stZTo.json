  "transcript": "hi everyone today we're going to talk\nabout how to land a cloud job in 2023\nfrom scratch this is exactly how I would\ndo it\nand uh it's probably gonna be a longer\nvideo debated on how I can make this\nshorter more YouTube algorithm friendly\nbut ultimately there's a lot of\ninformation that I want to share that I\nprobably just can't pack into a 5-10\nminute video\nso\ndo me a favor like subscribe comment\nshare all those good things leave a\ncomment please and\nif not\nit's just not going to do well and it's\nnot going to get shared to as many\npeople who will subscribe to the channel\nbecause that's just how the algorithm\nworks but ultimately I felt like I\ncouldn't just make it really short\nbecause there's a lot here I want to\nshare but\nuh let's switch to the screen and I can\nactually show you I'm talking about I\nwas I was like mapping this all out\nearlier today but depending on what\nscenario you're starting from I think\nI've got you cut right here so if you\nhave no experience if you have some\nexperience if you have uh like you're\nalready software Dev trying to switch\ninto Cloud if you're uh some some kind\nof already in a technical role trying to\nswitch into Cloud I've got you covered\nhere too if you've got nothing you're\nstarting from scratch I've got you\ncovered too so let's get started so I\nthink the the the first big part here is\nunderstanding where you're at\nso let's zoom in here and for example I\nstarted\nand we can probably say here like my\nhelp desk gig this was my help desk gig\nbut before that I was working retail but\nthat retail retail job I was working at\nApp Store worked at The Genius bar so a\nlot of that I did at like ticketing\nsystem I had a lot of experience with\ncustomers I had a lot of experience with\ntroubleshooting so things like that\nreally helped me build my case to go and\nland a helpless job which puts me here\nin this prereqs area\nand\nthat was a support role which is entry\nlevel for a lot of a lot of areas in\nTech like you can go support into\nsoftware Dev you can go from support to\nCloud support to devops support to new\nname the cloud the the technical role\nthat you want to get into support is a\ngreat entry level position to do it at\nbut if you're here and prior to you you\nonly have just a bunch of other type of\nexperience\nfind ways that you can relate to that to\nget you here\nso prereq land we'll scroll down here\nprobably you can get it done in a year\nbut this is pretty much your first door\ninto Tech like\nthis is\num either your support role but let's\nstart from the top either you have a\ndegree which kind of completes the space\nfor you you go through boot camp which\nwould probably complete the space to you\nor you have a com or you have related\nwork experience\nor you have a combination of this what I\ncall the self-taught\nuh framework which would include\ncertifications and I think this is a\nlittle\na little here confusing\nbut we'll talk a little bit more about\nthis too but what can you do to get here\nwell actually obviously you can get a\ndegree you can attend a boot camp or you\ncan get a help desk role plus self teach\nyourself which in my opinion\nthis is the\nthe the best route probably I'm biased\nbecause it's the route that I took but\nwhat I why do I say it's the best route\nwell\nlet's talk about the degree part first\nyou can be you can have all the\ntechnical skills in the world but if you\nare in\na country or region or however you want\nto define the limitation the limit there\nnot limitation\nyou that requires a degree then you're\ngonna have to get the degree like yeah a\nlot of you know Tech influencers or I\nguess public facing people will just\nblatantly make statements like you don't\nneed to agree to get into Tech but that\nignores a lot of the nuances as an\nexample I used to live in Ecuador and in\nEcuador there's a lot of prestige just a\nlot of Pride there's a lot of\npedigree\ntowards having a degree\nparents put a lot of of pride in being\nable to get their kids to to go to\nschool have them see that through\nand oftentimes many many entry-level\nroles will require a degree so that's a\ncountry where\nyou just have to have one you have to\nhave one that's it there's like no\nthere's no conversation about yes or no\npotentially that's changing a lot more\nnow and that's the case in a lot of\ncountries\nBut ultimately saying yes or no you need\none it just depends on so much more than\nif the job actually requires it so or\nthe skill set requires it keep that in\nmind okay in terms of boot camps I'm not\na big fan of boot camps but I can see it\nbeing useful for people who for example\nyou're working in a career that gives\nyou a certain amount of money and you\nneed to have that amount of money or\nmore because you have a family or\nwhatever financial responsibilities you\nhave and you can't go to like a help\ndesk job that could potentially pay less\nor the same\nso you doing a boot camp and projects\nand certifications on your side your the\ntime that you have your side while\nkeeping that job could be a good a good\nfit for you the only downside the boot\ncamps is one there's no real guarantee\nthat it's going to land your job\nand two it's just crazy expensive I've\nseen boot camps out there for like 20 30\n30 000 and oftentimes I'll see boot\ncamps not not even just advert like\nblatantly tell you what how much they\ncost like you have to go and you have to\nemail them and you have to set up a call\nand they have to first convince you and\nthen they tell you the price like it's\ncrazy the practices that they have\naround a lot of these\na lot of these\num\nboot camps establishments things like\nthat soum so there's that\nthat's why I personally think that the\nthe self-taught so the get helpless role\nplus self teach which is what I did but\nalso you're not getting into any debt\nyou know you're getting paid you're\ngetting experience and sometimes you can\neven Shadow additional teams\nthat like maybe you're working help desk\nthere's a cloud team there's a devops\nteam and you can sort of finesse your\nway into getting some time each week to\nShadow them like each week to hang out\nwith them just in hours two hours a week\njust to see what they're doing not\nnecessarily even do something but maybe\nyou can even build rapport and and this\nteam will help give you like low level\ntasks that you can get Hands-On with but\nyou won't get that experience or even\nthat opportunity if you're not in that\nkind of role and on the side you're\ngoing to self-teach yourself\nno that's sort of you complete this\nphase I pretty much think you can do\nthis in a year it me for me it took me a\nyear and a half but I knew looking back\nat it at a year or a little bit before a\nyear I was ready I was just scared I\ndidn't really know I was confused I\ndidn't know what to do but looking back\nat now I know a year I could have done\nit but it took me a year and a half ago\nso in terms of the self-teaching well\nwhat I mean by cell teach\nthe self-taught framework for success in\nmy opinion is two thirds and two\nprojects one associate level one project\nthat implements what you learn from that\nassociate level certification one\nspecialty sir and then that one project\nthat implements the knowledge that you\ngot from the specialty sir or bills on a\nproject your previous project so for\nexample\nin my opinion it's probably better idea\nto get like a wide range of skills so a\nlittle bit more Niche than your help\ndesk but still pretty wide because\nentry-level Cloud roles they're not\nlooking for someone who's super advanced\nin AWS super advanced in Azure super\nAdvanced and\na terraform but someone who knows a\ncouple of these things enough to be\ndangerous right\nso for example if you get like the Azure\n204 certification you go build a project\nthat implements that then maybe a good\ncertification would be like a Linux\nrelated certification a\nterraform-related certification a\nnetworking related certification uh\nsomething a little bit more developer\nfocused and something like that right\nso think of like T like T shapes like\nlike you get your your\nyour\ncertification your social certification\nsome sort of cloud platform and your\nprojects are Cloud related so you're\nbuilding these t-shaped skills\nand you have to you know have to find\nsome stuff that's complementary to that\nokay so in terms of certain projects\nthat in terms of your projects we'll\nwe'll talk about projects a little bit I\nwill also say sharing and networking\nyour knowledge so using things like\nTwitter LinkedIn YouTube and GitHub to\nshare your knowledge out there I highly\nhighly recommend you could also do Tick\nTock Instagram short form content I\nthink is great for this as well\nshare your knowledge but don't waste\nyour time here I'm gonna like add an\nemphasis emphasis here\ndon't\nwaste too much\ntoo much time here\ndon't let it consume you\ndon't be fake don't be fake\ndon't be annoying I'm gonna say don't be\nannoying don't be annoying okay\nsee some tips here\nin my six months Cloud study guide at\nthe very top here I'm recommending well\nI factor into the six months I factor in\nthree days at the end of each phase for\ndocumentation purposes so create a blog\npost LinkedIn post YouTube video\nsynthesizing what you've built with your\nnew skills challenges resources you use\nEtc don't try to come off as anything\nyou are not you are not an expert I'm\ncannot tell you how many times I see\nthese LinkedIn posts of people just\ntrying to come off of things that they\nare not it's okay to be at whatever\nlevel you are at that is fine\nit's not okay to fake it because you're\ngonna get caught you're gonna get into\nthese into these\nthese interviewing opportunities where\nyou have no idea what you're doing no\nidea where you're talking\nand that's not good use your own style\nyour own voice no authenticity and\nrealness helps land jobs too 100 percent\nI like to talk about this this framework\nof Landing a job where it's 50 your\nskill set everything that's in your\ncontrol skill set your resume your\nprojects that you've built the\ncertification that you have and then 50\njust luck just opportunity right place\nright time but I feel like that 50 there\nyou can improve if you're just a nice\nperson to talk to if you're a nice\nperson to work with if you come off nice\ntoo uh or real or just you are who you\nare\non on like social medias on these\nnetworking opportunities on your initial\nphone screening like all of that right\nso keep that stuff in mind I really do\nbelieve that that makes a change a a an\nimprovement to your chances as well\nbecause ultimately we are people working\nwith people okay keep that in mind so\nyeah\nback here uh sharing your knowledge but\ndon't waste your time you the majority\nof your time should be spent building\nlike enjoying uh the pro learning\nprocess enjoying your life getting\nstudying all these types of things let\nsocial media uh all decide forwhen you have some spare time okay even\nI as someone who's now in the space you\nknow for a couple of years\nhave been trying to eliminate social\nmedia more and more because I feel like\nit's just not productive uh but for\nknowledge sharing and for networking it\nis productive so keep that in mind too\nokay\nso that's sort of your self-taught\nframework for success and then with this\nI think you can go so depending on where\nyou're at actually so if you have\nrelated work experience you go and build\nthis stuff can take you this probably\ncan take you uh instead of one year\nbecause you're not gonna be working\nyou're already in your related work\nexperience job so your software Dev\nor whatever it is that you're at it's\nprobably taking you like three to six\nmonths to go and build the things that\nyou need\nand then you can go straight to applying\nto your Cloud engineer Cloud developer\nany role that has cloud in in the title\nI've divided these types of roles that\nyou're applying to either Cloud exposure\nroles or Cloud jobs that actually have\ncloud in the world title okay you can\nprobably go straight to here once you\nhave everything that you need to build\nfor Success uh one thing I wanted to\nshow you is\nuh GitHub when you're sharing your\nprojects in GitHub you want to have it\nwell documented like I can show you I\ndon't know like my timestamper projectyou can see here I have a little GIF of\nhow it works prereqs how to set it up\nhow to use it how it works and\ncontributing\nsome of these I even have something like\nlet's look at this one here\nagain I got the architecture up here\nsome more information some more\ninformation running locally some more\ninformation that I decided it's useful I\nhave also have known issues of things I\nneed to fix things I want to implement\nstuff like that\nbut yeah don't have an empty readme use\nit to give the instructions that people\nneed to implement your project or any\nadditional things that you find useful\nthere okay\nall right so back here\nyeah so Cloud exposure Cloud job roles\nthey're different\nso you have your projects you know you\ncould probably go straight to applying\nto your Cloud roles if you are here like\nI was in this position where I had my\nhelp desk and then I was trying to apply\nto Cloud jobs but I just consistently\ngot rejected I took a step back and I\nsaw myself in in my skill set I'm like\nokay maybe there's a step that I can\ntake in between here that's going to\nbetter my my improvements so\nfrom applying here so you know one year\nhelp desk one year and a half helped us\nexperience and certifications project\njobs\nprojects and applying to jobs that had\ncloud in them I was getting rejected\npretty much 100 of the time after my\nyear in my\nin my year of\ndoing I did this admin gig here for\nabout a year then I was getting way\nbetter I was probably at like more so 50\nrejection but finally getting different\nopportunities to interview and actually\nshowcase myself in interviews and things\nlike that I ultimately ended up not\ngoing for cloud opportunities externally\nand I got promoted after the year uh but\nbefore we talk about that let's talk\nabout what this actually Cloud exposure\nmeans oftentimes at the beginning\nof you know wanting to get into Cloud\npeople will be obsessed about it has to\nhave Cloud on the title but that's why\nI've added here stop caring about rule\ntitles care about descriptions any roles\nthat give you experience to things like\nhandling virtual machines scripting\nticking systems troubleshooting active\ndirectory 365 programming will give you\nCloud exposure\nespecially things like active directory\nin 365.\num but all these things will give you\nskill sets that you can later on\nLeverage for cloud jobs and ultimately\nwhat matters to Landing a job is\nexperience experience is Queen\nexperience is up there experiences what\neveryone cares about the most everything\nelse is secondary okay\nso keep that in mind so any roles that\ngive you that exposure if you have to go\ndo six months to a year in that role\nbefore so you can improve your chances\nto go and go into Cloud role why not do\nit\nwhy not give it a shot these roles here\nplay pretty well like I was making 55k\nthis was and I was underpaid and this\nwas like five years ago so a lot of\nthese sysadmin Network admin Cloud\nsupport roles Junior Dev rolls paid\ndecently and you're getting the\nexperience you want but ultimately in\nyour mind you got to remind yourself you\nare not going to do this role forever\nthis isn't the rest of your life this is\nonly for the Year this is only your\nstepping stone and a lot of times me\nreminding myself to me make the role\nmore would make the role more bearable\nwould be like okay I just got to do my\nbest now because moving forward I know I\nneed all this stuff so keep that in mind\nokay\nso in here you're also you know\ncontinuing your self-taught framework\nfor Success if you completed all of this\nin like that year of your help desk gig\nthen what you can do is it just with the\nknowledge that you get from this gig\nhere go and build on the certificate the\ncertification project that you built so\nthis project here well now maybe you've\npicked up some active directory or some\nprogramming skills like how do you\nimprove\nthose those skills how do you implement\nthose skills into these projects that\nyou've built and also since you went and\nonce you completed your first\ncertification your first project you go\nyou went and shared it you blogged you\nmade a video do a follow video be like\noh how I improved my\nbeginner project with a year of\nexperience or something like that I\ndon't know there's just plenty of\nopportunities here right but continue\nbuilding that online portfolio continue\nbuilding in the network all that kind of\nstuff and the best way to do that is\nthrough your knowledge through actually\nbuilding stuff and sharing okay\nso about a year year after that you're\nnow in the position that these people\nwith related work experience\nhave you now have your two years of\nexperience and you go and play apply to\nyour Cloud job your Cloud engineer Cloud\ndeveloper devops engineer any role you\nwant with cloud in it you're in a better\nposition now to go and get it\nbut as far as Landing a role any any\nrole actually\num a lot of these these these prereq\nroles like help desk support these uh\nCloud exposure roles like this admin\nthings like that are a lot more lenient\nand once you get to your Cloud role\nyou're probably going to get a lot more\nwhiteboarding a lot more technical\nknowledge and expertise needing to be\nshowcased and this is also just a lot\nmore competitive because these pay a lot\nbetter obviously\nbut interviewing skills and your resume\ncover letter and Linkedin are important\nevery step\nso let's dive a little bit deeper into\ninto this year so interviewing skills\nit's practice practice practice practice\nI sound like AI right now practice\npractice\nyou shouldn't be going into an interview\nand thinking about how to answer a\nquestion like a soft skills related\nquestion like if I asked you can you\ntalk to me about a situation where you\ngot negative feedback from a colleague\nhow did you handle it and how did it\nimprove your work moving forward you\nshouldn't be thinking they're sitting\ndown\num I don't know uh oh this one time like\nno\nno no no no no no no\ngo and look up a list of soft skill\nquestions and sit down get the list and\njust write down what your answers would\nbe I obviously don't make them up pull\nthem from your experience but be able to\nspeak to them in a way where you're\nconfident when you're confident\nconfident delivering even the most\nsimplest answer when you deliver it with\nease with finesse with confidence that\nimproves how you come off to your people\nwho are interviewing you but that also\nimproves how you feel about how you're\ndoing in an interview so then when a\nhard question does come up\nyou've got your confidence up and you're\nfeeling like no worries I got this I can\nfigure this out okay so keep that in\nmind it is all about practice figure out\nthe questions that are going to be asked\nyou in terms of like the soft skill\nquestions but also have a list of\nquestions that you want to ask there's\nnothing worse than going into an\ninterview and they ask you okay do you\nhave any questions and you're like no\nthat shows that you didn't do your\nhomework that you didn't look up things\nabout the company you have even if you\nhave to just come up with a bunch of\nquestions that are like not fake but\nthings that you necessarily don't have\ntoo much interest just the the\nopportunity to ask someone at a company\na question gives you some Insider\nknowledge on okay this is how uh they\napproach answering questions so this is\nhow the specific person answers\nquestions things like that that is great\nknowledge for you to know as well\nbecause in an interview it's not only\nabout you finding a fit if you're a fit\nit's also finding if that place is a fit\nfor you too right\nanother thing to add here is know your\nprojects in and out you should be able\nto explain about a project why you\nselected a service\num what and what things would you\nimprove what were your challenge is uh\nwhat was the result things like that\nlike know it in and out I have a great\ndocumentation around your projects if\nsomeone asks you hey let's talk about a\nproject that you built on the side be\nable to talk about it hey let's talk\nabout a project that you built at your\nprevious company be able to talk about\nit in and out comfortable practice\npractice practice practice practice\npractice practice\nrecord yourself watch yourself in the\nmirror ask your partner to hang out with\nyou ask your best friend whoever it is\nlike practice these interviewing skills\nthese conversational skills this is why\nI always recommend if someone has no\ntechnical experience and wants to start\nfrom scratch go on getting the help desk\nscroll because the amount of customer\nexperience and people skills you develop\nhere because you're talking through\nissues is phenomenal uh I get the\ncomment about hey Gwen you're so great\nabout talking on camera you're so great\ntalking to people like how did you\nfigure that out a lot of that was\nhelpless a lot of that was when people\nwere so upset about the fact that their\ncomputer stopped working and they would\njust trash me and I was like you know\nwhat I understand it I gotta ask you\nsome questions to kind of reverse\nengineer what's going on let's talk it\nthrough a lot of that was from there\nobviously a lot of it was just\npracticing recording videos too but a\nlot of that came from help desk okay so\npractice practice okay\nwhiteboarding so I have a couple videos\non whiteboarding I'm going to actually\npull up my Channel right now\nI have two I have one on\nHigh availability in Fault tolerance and\nthen I have one on Ellis this elasticity\nand scalability so you can actually go\nto an architecture sensor whether that\nbe Azure AWS or gcp and just find a\nbunch of different concepts that you can\nreverse engineer in diagram but remember\nthat the most important part about\nwhiteboarding is not just you being able\nto to to write out the concept but it's\nit's your ability to explain and\ncommunicate as you go because I can just\nanyone can go and draw a figure on a\nwhiteboard but that's not whiteboarding\nright it's also about you talking\nthrough explaining your thought process\nso keep that in mind so I think I do a\npretty good job with these two videos I\nwant to do more if you have any\nrecommendations on topics that you want\nto see do them\nyou can also go to the architecture\ncenters and find architectures and just\nreverse engineer them instead of so for\nexample if I if someone asks you oh\nhere's one of the projects that you've\nbuilt can you diagram it out can you\nwhiteboard out for you for me and then\nyou you you're walking through like okay\nyeah so\nhere's this virtual machine I've got the\nweb tier on this one it's got the data\ntier on here I've got a load balancer of\nthis type here I've got some network\nsecurity Loops here the traffic\ninterests here whatever you know you\njust talk through talk through the\nproject that you built right\nand this is your opportunity to showcase\nyour technical skill set and your\ncommunication skill set which are two\nvery very big things when it comes to\njobs because we work with people we are\npeople working with other people okay\nokay last thing on here is the resume\ncover letter and Linkedin resume\ntailored specific result driven and as\nconcise as possible at this point you\nknow if you're going the route that I\ndid you have\n1.5 years in retail or any kind of\nproduct prior experience before you hit\nprereqs then you got your help desk\nexperience then you got your Cloud\nexposure experience and now you're\napplying to your Cloud roles right\nso you got to go to one experience that\nyou can add there potentially the stuff\nthat you did before might not be super\nrelevant but if it is relevant tailor it\nto the job that you're applying to I\nknow it's a lot of work to tailor\nresumes But ultimately it's a game that\nwe all got to play it's perhaps a broken\nsystem but we cannot fix the system I\nwant to emphasize this we cannot fix the\nsystem if we're not in it we can go and\nget into the system and make it easier\nfor other people to come in to make it\nmore of a fair opportunity I understand\nthat but we can't do that from the\ninside we've got to do from the ins from\nfrom the outside we got it from the\ninside so ultimately this is a game that\nwe have to play everything that's that\nthey want is kind of out there laid out\nwe got a reverse engineer it and match\nour skill set match our resumes our\ncover letters our online presence so\nthat so let's go let's do it let's get\nit done let's get in let's improve the\nsystem and then you know hopefully it\nbecomes better for other people\nbut resume tailored uh look for the job\nthat you want and then see what they're\nasking and align your skills align your\nresumes align how you're explaining your\nresponsibility to that\nspecific results driven so instead of\nsaying so for example I in my assist\nadmin job I automated a process that\ntook 20 to 30 hours of my colleague 20\nhours of my colleague's time of their\nlike manual work\nautomated to a process that runs in less\nthan an hour a week and for under 30\ncents a month ultimately saving the\ncompany hours and lots of money right so\nthat's sort of the result\nthere's a lot more people in the world\nthat can understand that statement than\nme saying something automated a process\nusing Azure functions and several Azure\nTechnologies right\nso the result is probably the most\nimportant because ultimately you are\nfulfilling a business need yes you are a\ncloud engineer you're a cloud developer\nyou're a devops engineer but you are\nfulfilling a business need\nso you need to speak in business terms\nyou need to be able to to explain your\nskill set in business terms\nand then you can also add there like\nokay so you did the first bite results\nshow and then add oh used Azure services\nand you can put a line in there\ndescribing what you use see how best of\nboth for its worlds you have the\nbusiness Aid and the technical need\ncovered there\nresults are driven\nvery very important okay\nand as concise as possible if you can\nkeep it to a one page you're awesome if\nyou if youlike don't need to add you know how some\npeople have like soft skills interest\nthings I don't think things like that\nmatter your education your experience\nand any projects I think that's all you\nreally need for your for your resume\nkeep in concise because people are just\nglancing at these glancing at your\nresumes uh cover letters\nI personally have written I personally\nhave written cover letters for every\nsingle job that I've wanted but\nthis is really up to you if if in my\nopinion it's if the cover letter has\neven one percent chance of improving my\nopportunity to land an interview I'm\ngonna do it so that's why I did it but\nultimately if you don't want to do them\nit's up to you I recommend yes but\nI can't tell you what to do okay cool so\nthat's sort of like the the the road map\nthere right\nthe last thing I want to share is sort\nof what to use to teach yourself or or\nwhat you need to cover\num and I'm going to show you learn a\ncloud learn a cloud is actually this I I\ntweeted this back June 19 2021 if I had\nto learn cloud from scratch in six\nmonths and gain a junior Cloud engineer\nskill set\nand I would do six weeks Linux and\nnetworking Basics six weeks learning to\ncode eight weeks learning to Cloud\nplatforms four weeks some devouts\npractices and lots of projects that you\nface each phase this was a viral tweet\nand I wanted to follow it up with you\nknow actually putting my money where my\nmouth is and building something that now\nhas become the\nmost popular open source guide to cloud\ncomputing it's free I'm not trying to\nsell you anything but if you don't want\nto use the guide that's fine but I say I\nhighly recommend just covering these\nfundamentals here\nfashion networking programming Cloud\nplatform devops and Cloud security again\nif you don't want to use a guide to\nlearn that that's completely fine go\nfigure out how you do it but just cover\ncover your backs with having that each\nphase I do have\num\nso it follows this\nthis here it follows how to break down\nthis phase so how how this phase applies\nto how this technology applies to Cloud\nhow would you break it down resources\nthat you can use the majority of these\nare free if not in my opinion affordable\nless than 50 USD\nand stuff that I've either\nmade or recommend\nbecause I've used the majority of stuff\nthat I've used and I recommend I can't\ncreate that much content and then\nprojects that you should build and\nthere's a knowledge checks called things\nyou should be familiar with at the end\nof this phase\nwhat I recommend is go into the phase go\nto the bottom see if you can do the\nmajority of things here if you can move\non to next phase if you can't stay on\nthat face and go through that one\nso there's one for Linux programming\nagain it follows that same structure\ncloud devops cloud security and then\nthere's more projects if you need more\nprojects here on the left side some\nother study resources\nuh if you need sort of some more\nmentality around how I study\nsuccessfully for classifications there\nis a video here on that but there's also\nblog posts in the description of video\nand it gives you more insight of to like\nokay and in your first Cloud job how to\nfind great study material how to\nactually study stuff like that okay this\nthis guide is packed with stuff that\nI've just recollected in my let's see\nnine years working in Tech so\nagain if you don't want to use it\ncompletely fine but the guy the guide\nfollows more so a kind of at your\nleisure type of thing if you want more\nof an intense program go to the six\nmonth Cloud study pan if you go to the\nguide and then click study plan on the\ntop left it'll take you there but it's\nalso made by made by gps.com forward\nslash Cloud camp\nlet me zoom in on here here made by\ngps.com forward slash cloud clamp if\nyou're interested I wrote this January\n5th\num\nI wanted to say the New Year giving\npeople something useful to learn\nlearn cloud computing so anyway do you\nread everything the protocol kind of\ngives you the mindset of like how many\nhours you take what things should you\nkeep in mind how to take notes stuff\nlike that there's some instructions here\nI am going to update this because I want\nto incorporate\nuh the use and the learning of gbt and\nGitHub co-pilot because I really think\nthat that can perhaps not accelerate\nyour learning but it's going to give you\na lot more\nknowledge and a lot more to learn\num\nit might even be easier for you to learn\nif you if you learn how to add it to\nyour skill set so anyway\nit starts with telling you the topic\nagain why it matters and a couple of\ninstructions uh one link to Resource\nthat I recommend and it breaks it down\ntwo weeks two weeks you spend ten days\ndoing this four days doing this\n10 days doing this four days doing this\nand networking python et cetera et\ncetera so there's the time breakdown in\nthis also project ideas but more\nimportantly remember I said here that\nthe sharing and networking your\nknowledge to build your online portfolio\nand your presence and to meet more\npeople\nwell I added that I factored that into\nthe six months so I factored it into the\nend I factored in three days retrace for\ndocumentation purposes you can use them\nwho are that mean is after you spend two\nweeks you spend 10 days doing this four\ndays doing this spend three days writing\nabout\nyour your process like uh talk about\ncreate a blog post LinkedIn posts or\nYouTube video synthesizing what you've\nbuilt with your new skills challenges\nresources use Etc don't try to come off\nas anything you aren't you're not an\nexpert use your own style and voice\nauthenticity realness helps land jobs\ntoo and this is why you should keep a\ndaily study Journal so you can reference\nthings to talk uh or to write about\nlater okay so keep that in mind there\ntoo\nand that's pretty much it\num\none last thing I want to add is\nyou know you get to that point where\nyou're you're applying and\n50 is in your controlling fifty percent\nis not\nwell sort of 50 is like the skill set\nthe projects the certifications the\nprior experience\nand the other 50 happens to just be\nopportunity luck uh right place right\ntime is the hiring manager in a in a\ngood mood but I often\nfind that you can improve that that last\n50 percent by simply being a great\nperson simply being someone that people\nlike to talk to that people like to work\nwith that likes to help that gives a\ngood impression online that gives an\nauthentic impression online that gives\noff a good vibe during that initial\nphone screening oftentimes opportunities\nsimply can come to you because you are a\ndecent person and yes it's Tech yes it's\na lot of text technical skill set but we\nare people\nand people like to work with people all\nright keep that in mind uh that's all I\ngot here is a pretty long video I'm not\ngoing to edit it just gonna go straight\ninto YouTube and uh everything that I\nshared here I will have in the\ndescription\nand I will share this diagram if this\nvideo gets 400 likes all right\nmuch luck to you if you have any other\nthings you want me to cover let me know\nI will see you in the next one",
