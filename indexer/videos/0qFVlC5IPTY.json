  "transcript": "what is going on party people today we\nare talking about this thingy here\nbut also if you are looking to get\nstarted with azure learning azure maybe\nyou're studying for the az900 which is\nthe entry level\nazure certification i have some good\ngood goodies i have some goodies for you\nbut i'll talk about that at the end of\nthis video\num yeah let's talk about how i got this\nnothing has given me more imposter\nsyndrome\nthan having this award um i guess i\nshould start off by saying that\nthe mvp award is something that you have\nto be nominated for\nby someone at microsoft or someone who's\nan mvp already\nyou can't like sign up for it or apply\nfor it or you know\ni don't know it's not like a form you\nfill out or anything like that\nyeah you have to be nominated um so i\nwas nominated back\nfor in the for the first time back in\ni want to say like march perhaps\nand i had just started my youtube\nchannel i had a couple of videos\num the entire time of having my youtube\nchannel i've been consistent with like\nat least a video or two each week\nso i had a couple of videos back then\nbut i had just got gotten started\nyou know each video had a blog post back\nthen too so i had some content out there\nbut nothing significant so i was\nnominated by someone at microsoft\nand i got rejected obviously because i\ndidn't have enough\nstuff um they were like it's great but\nit's not enough for us\nto judge the quality i did feel a little\nbummed\nbut it just like motivated me it was\nlike now i got to keep grinding so\num the mvp thing kind of just was like\nin the back of my mind but it wasn't\nreally like\na goal anymore because i kind of\ni did get my feelings hurt i'm not gonna\nlie but uh anyway\nyeah i kept making like a video two uh\nper week and\ncome like june i think june or july\num someone else from microsoft nominates\nme\nand um you might ask like gwen how do\nyou know all these microsoft people\nand the answer is social media i've been\nsharing my stuff\nuh like all the tutorials and videos\nthat i've made on reddit and twitter\nlinkedin\ninstagram literally anywhere that have a\nsocial media profile\nand you know how social media is people\nyou know find it like it retweet it and\nit gets on other people's radar and just\nlike that that's really\nyeah that's the only answer i have um so\nyeah anyway i get nominated again\ntowards the beginning of the summer and\nit was great\ni really felt like that this time\ni'm like i definitely i'm definitely\ngonna get this but um i don't hear back\nuntil august 1st\nso i kind of went through the entire\nsummer not knowing and\naugust first i get the email like hey\nyou've been awarded this and i have like\na reaction video and an unboxing video\nof the award\non my channel you can go look at those\nif you'd like and yeah and i got it\nand then after a couple of weeks you\nactually get this and then for each year\nyou get one of these\nthingies and you also get like that\nplaque thingy up there and that thing\nhas my name\nit's pretty cool actually when i got the\naward um\nmy parents actually hugged me they told\nme they were proud so that was nice\nbut yeah you got a couple of goodies and\nobviously the recognition and\ni'm able to put like hey i'm an mvp in\nmy twitter bio and it has helped like\nlanding\num like consulting gigs and it\ndefinitely helped uh to land\nmy role at acg now um yeah i can't lie\nit's nice it's open be up to\nyou know the community of mvps and a\ncouple of other resources\nand yeah it's been great but there's no\nreal secret to actually getting it\num there's no and i think i think that's\ngood like there's no time requirement\nthere's no like\namount of things you have to do or\nvideos you have to create or blog posts\nor podcasts or anything like that\nthey really just judge you on hey are\nyou creating\nconsistent quality content for the\ncommunity that's really it\num so sorry if that wasn't the answer\nyou were looking for but that's really\nhow it happened for me\nand i guess the best tip i can make i\nguess the best tip i can give you all\nif you're interested in becoming an mvp\nis\nreally just create content that's\nuniquely you keep in mind that\neverything that's out there has been\ndone already\nmy stuff isn't necessarily new but i\nthink i do bring um\ni bring myself into it like you seem you\nknow\nmy face and my personality in my videos\nand i'm very proud of that and i think\nthat helps me stick out\nso just make sure you bring you to your\ncontent right\nthat's pretty much it um oh yes in terms\nof the goodies that i was mentioning\nmentioning at the beginning so if you're\nstudying for the ac 900 maybe you're new\nto cloud\num i remember those times they were very\nconfusing very stressful\num very anxious but anyway\ni'm going to be doing a live walkthrough\nof that exam we're going to have some\nsample questions\nand we're going to go over the answers\nwe're going to talk a little bit about\ntips\nand just have fun we're going to study\ntogether that's going to be live on the\nacg\nyoutube channel i'm going to leave the\nlink in the description that's going to\nbe february 2nd\ni don't remember the exact time but\nagain like i said the link will be in\nthe description you can come hang out in\nthe chat\nask questions uh we'll be there to help\nyou out\nso let's study together right also\ni released some more azure fundamental\nvideos\non the acg youtube channel and one is\nabout setting up budgets and billing\nalerts i don't know if i've ever told\nthis story on the on the channel but\nwhen i was a junior cloud engineer um at\nthat role\nuh we had like we had time to kind of\njust play around and experiment with\nstuff and just learn\num so i had once been playing around\nwith i think it was cosmos db\nand i racked up like a thousand dollars\nover i don't know if it was a month or a\nlittle bit over a month\nbecause i had forgotten to remove the\nresource after i was done playing with\nit\nand luckily my boss was you know still\nis a fantastic guy and he was like don't\nworry about it\num but yeah if i had to end up\nuh budgets and billing alerts that would\nhave never happened so now that there's\nthis video\ni'm very happy to share this as a\nresource for you all there's also a\nvideo on securing your account with mfa\nand such\nthat's also there i'll link all the\nstuff in the description\noh and if you are studying for the az900\nthe actual az900 certification course is\nfree for you to take so it's an entire\ncertification course\nfor you to indulge in\nfor free um as you can see i'm studying\nfor my epic one and i'm trying to share\nmore like updates on\nlike you know when i'm done studying or\nyou know what i covered and such\nnot necessarily like full videos but\njust like posts like you'll see them in\nthe community tab here on my channel\ni'll share a post like hey i just\nfinished studying what are you studying\ntalk to me\num as much as i love hearing from you\nall and what you all studying about\nit really helps me keep myself\naccountable um just knowing that\nyou know there's people out there who\nkind of look for uh like a gentle\nreminder like hey gwen's studying maybe\ni should study two or something like\nthat\nit really helps me because i struggle\nwith studying every single day um\ni sit down and i'm like man i really\ndon't want to do this i'd rather like\nplay like far cry or gta\nbut you know it's something we all have\nto get done right so just sharing those\nlittle updates with y'all really does\nhelp me so that's been great\nand that is pretty much it um\nyeah a bunch of cool stuff we're doing a\nlot of azure stuff this month
