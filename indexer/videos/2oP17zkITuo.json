  "transcript": "flipping myself and it i used it as an\nopportunity to keep me\naccountable to get up to drink water to\nstretch to go outside and get some sun\nand yeah unfortunately when you stop\nseeing those tweets it's because i have\nfallen way off the wagon and i'm so\ninundated so i need to make that a\npriority thank you because i don't know\nhow many people are watching or\nlistening or reading and that's that\nmeans a lot that means a lot because i\ndo it because it helps me too you know\nyeah and i think when when we do things\nout of like we're we're trying to not\nonly improve ourselves and sort of put\nit out there and be transparent about it\nyou know you never really know who\nyou're going to\nreach right no you never you just put it\nout there and hope for the best you know\nhopefully it reaches somebody i\nabsolutely just want to do do a quick\nhide in the chat we have joanna here we\nhave richard uh sylvia's checking in\nfrom michigan we got john from uh sc\nsouth carolina south carolina all right\nawesome colorado springs in the house\nmichael from the uk hey allison from\nindia we got andrew here saying\nafternoon hello everyone uh do make sure\nto hit a little like up the stream so so\num you know just let us know that like\nhow you're feeling about this kind of\nstuff um anyway angela yes i know you're\nat redhead now\nbut i'm assuming you just didn't like\njust sort of roll into a role at red hat\njust like casually applied and you know\nnot even\nnot even okay good uh i want to i want\nto get right into it\ni want to know\nwhat was your first role um and can you\ntell me a little bit about how you\nlanded it\noh i'll be happy to so\ni was\ni started out as a secretary like in an\ninsurance company and they used to have\nall these classes you can take to learn\nyou know windows and unix and networking\nand this and hardware and all this stuff\nyou know and i used to take all these\nclasses right because we could it was\nfree\nand i worked for a gentleman who was a\nprogrammer by trade but he was the vice\npresident of our division and you know\nhe was like wow you're really taking all\nthese classes you're getting you know\nreal slick you know just you know you're\nso helpful now i'm i'm literally doing\ntech support for my department like i'm\nthe secretary but i'm doing tech support\nfor the department he's like\nhow about you make this official like\nyou become the tech support person for\nthe department and because we had a\nbigger department in a different\nlocation i went to this other location\nand that was like my first help desk\nposition um and then after that the\ndrive was killing me but after that i\njoined a company\num i was on their health that was my\nfirst like real like i kind of\ntransitioned i was still a secretary but\ni was you know\nhelp desk was the way like i learned so\nmuch\nabout everything yeah technical because\ni touched everything that or interfaced\nwith everything at some point um it was\nliterally the best gateway into this\nseat where i'm sitting in right now with\nthat red hat over my shoulder it was\ndefinitely the best\nbest gateway that's a that's a little uh\ni don't know if people notice the red\nhat is right behind\nright now oh yeah\nbut that was\ni was neat\nto see it there uh you you already\ntapped into like a bunch of things that\ni want to talk about but i think the\nfirst thing is you mentioned you know\nsort of just learning things taking\nclasses doing things like that um what\nwhat\nhow did you sort of i guess learn things\nfor that first role um like like what\nwas your like approach like\nlike like because when you're getting\nstarted it's like well\nwhat do i even need to learn like what i\nused to need books do i need classes\nlike like what's your background in\neducation and all that kind of thing so\nlet me level set this happened in the\n90s so\ndon't\ni\ni'm probably older than a lot of folks\non this on this stream but\nthat's when before youtube that was\nbefore um a lot of the online learning\nplatforms that we know and we love it\nwas taking a class it was buying a book\nit was you know reading hard back\nmaterial to learn and do that's you know\nthat's how it was back then\num\nand you would\nyou know have like your test servers or\nsystems and you would play around with\nthem and you'd break fix and do things\nlike that so it was a lot of hands-on\nyou had to be self-motivated because\nthere was nothing there to kind of keep\nyou tied there was like you know not\nyour alerts on your phone telling you\nyou haven't learned today like you know\nit was none of that it was none of that\nit was this is something that i want to\nlearn i want to get better at it and the\nmore you do it the more you read about\nit the more you try it the more you talk\nabout it you just you just develop an\nacumen for it not you know you're not\nperfect because you're every interaction\nyou're learning a little bit more right\nand thank god for youtube because that\nliterally helped change my trajectory a\nwhole like\nfrom zero to 100.\nit was just phenomenal right yeah and\naround your first world for for it where\nwere you did you go to college for like\nthe technical degree no i don't so i\nhave a business degree and i will say\nthis um i did want to be a computer\nscience major but i couldn't pass um\ncalculus\nyou me both let's get me started it's\nlike oh you can't pass calculus ma'am\ni'm sorry you can't be a computer\nscience major so\ni became a business major and business\ncommunication so i learned about\ncommunications i had a really\nwell-rounded liberal arts education um\nthat i'm very grateful for because\ni can talk about anything to anybody you\nknow shout out to liberal arts colleges\nbecause um they give you a really good\nfoundation now what i've been happy with\nthe computer science degree heck yeah\nlike\nyou know that that's what i wanted to do\nbut i just couldn't do calculus like\nthat was that that was that barrier and\nyou know it to some that's not really a\nbarrier but there are so sometimes\nthere's so many barriers right right so\ni didn't learn tech in college i learned\nit\noutside of it yeah i'm on the on the job\nkind of on the job on the side\nabsolutely it's it's interesting that\nyou tap into that that the aspect of\nlearning to communicate well because i\ncan imagine now as a solution to\narchitect\nyou're you're all about your ability to\ncommunicate\nyour solutions and all those kinds of\nthings right we'll dive into a little\nlater because there's like so much that\nwe need to get into about like before\nright\ni'm curious about what how do you\nremember interviewing for your first\nlike official help desk girl because i\nknow you mentioned you started in the\nsecretary and moved into your first help\ndesk role i i would love to sort of just\nlike if you can like remember things\nmaybe something sticks out or like what\nwas it like\nokay\nlet me take you back the year is 1997\nand i am\ninterviewing for at a chemical company\nfor a help desk position and the help\ndesk was like a room full of people um\nsupporting this you know multinational\ncompany right\nand\ni got interviewed by this guy and he you\nknow he was like one of the smartest\npeople i'd ever come in contact with he\nwas just so tech and so nice and so down\nto earth so fast forward i get this job\ni'm i'm surrounded by people who\nhave done this for many years um who was\nyou know this was their their career of\nchoice um i had people who were career\nswitchers who came into the tech the i.t\ndepartment but we were a part of a\nbigger it organization so of course we\nhave like the um the networking team and\nthe the help the bench the people who\nactually do the hardware so it was a\nconglomerate of folks down there working\nin this huge area and\nyou know i got really good at\nwalking people through these technical\nissues um this is where i started kind\nof like writing my own you know s um\nsops we call them\num uh what do you call it something\nsomething i can't remember the acronym\nbut um you would write these things that\nwould help you like troubleshoot issues\nand i got really good at kind of writing\nthese little scripts out to standard\noperating procedures good lord anyway so\nthis is how you would fix this so that\nwas kind of like my first dip into\nwriting documentation right right like\nwriting these sops for myself and then\nat some point it was for other you know\nfor the department and then i kind of\nyou know i got antsy like i was like\nwatching over on the other for the wall\nyou can see the bench people doing the\nhardware work that's what i was doing\nwhen i was at my old spot i learned\nabout you know taking computers apart\nreplacing hard drives and memory so i\nwound up going to the bench at some\npoint\nand i was there for a while and then\nbecause we were contractors i had they\nwere going to not renew the contract\nwent to another place was on the help\ndesk and i i didn't like it so i wind up\ngoing back and they were like no we'll\nkeep you we'll keep you\nso\nagain went to another help desk position\nand then that's where i got into\nnetworking and servers and linux and\nwindows and dns and dhcp and all this so\ni was the only help this person the\ncompany had it was just me and this\ncontractor and he was kind of like yeah\nwell let me just show you the ropes what\nwe're doing here because they're going\nto kick him out the door now that i'm\nhere yeah um and that's where it started\ni literally had to you know it was a\ncompany that earned like like 117\nfunerals and uh funeral homes and\ncemeteries right i was the only tech\nsupport person\nand then eventually had grown i've moved\nfrom help desk to more\nnetworking servers i mean this was nt4\nexchange five five that's literally how\ni did it i learned by doing and\nyou know being able to show them the\nacumen like this girl picks things up\nreally easy really quickly she can talk\nto people she can communicate she knows\nhow you know she knows a way around the\nserver she can rack and she can stack\nlike i was gold right\ni learned so much there shout out to my\nold boss jeff\nhe was the best mentor that you could\never have because he had faith in me\nyeah\nyeah give yourself a chance\nyeah i think\nso so those those first few years and i\nremember my career as well you're you're\nnot only overwhelmed you're also\nconfused you don't really know who you\ncan rely on and i think i think we share\nthis in common in terms of like one help\ndesk was how we both sort of got into\nwhere we're at now um\ntwo also just having a manager that\nbelieved in us but i think you don't\njust sort of stumble onto that of course\nit's sort of like 50 of the the the i\nguess the opportunity is like having\nhaving someone who's willing to believe\nin you but that like to sort of gain\nthat you also have to like put in a lot\nof work i remember doing like a lot of\novertime staying a little later just to\nhave some more faith like face-to-face\ntime with the manager with a different\nteam\ngetting all my stuff done as soon as i\ncould so i could go shadow different\nteams and also just having the interest\nand and sort of putting myself out there\nand educating myself on my own time that\nway when i did have exposure to those\nother teams i knew what to ask i knew\nwhat to look at all those kinds of\nthings right um\nand those opportunities i'm not saying\nthey're unique to help desk positions\nbut i'm just saying like you mentioned\nthe amount of things that you do get\nexposed to at a help desk role at a\nsupport role at like a like like front\nof the line role it's just\ni can't i don't see another role in tech\nthat is like like like that right that\ntouches all the things it touches your\nyour entire text deck\nat where you were you know where you\nwork and and helped us grow you're going\nto be exposed to to some degree\nand in that role because everything\nneeds support and everyone needs support\nso i remember you know from uh i used to\nwork at like a like a health clinic so\nfrom the nurses to the ceos cfo cio ctos\nto the doctors everyone at some point\nneeded some sort of help desk assistance\nand you never know what kind of\nconversations might come up what kind of\nlike people skills that you develop\nbecause of this and i am so\nyou you might feel this way too like\nwhen you were in your help dust girl\nyou're like i hate this i can't wait to\nleave\nlooking back at it now i'm like i am so\ngrateful for the time that i spent there\ni would have never developed into who i\nam now without that time my ability to\ncommunicate comes from that my ability\nto document there is no role out there\nthat requires more documentation skills\nthan help desk\ni'm telling you from\nthis person came up to me at this time\napproached me this way via this this\nthis method this was their issue this is\nhow they talk to me about it this is how\nthey encountered the issue this is how i\nreplicated it this is what i tried this\nis what didn't work this is what didn't\nwork this is what didn't work this is\nwhat it kind of worked this is what\nsolved it this is how i recommend it and\nthat that amount of questions that you\nneed to document is for every single\nissue and every single support ticket\nthat comes up to you and you're not\ndoing just one a day right\nif you're if you're assisting several\nlocations that you mentioned you're\ndoing like i don't know several an hour\nand\nyou know that every single day and after\njust think of it just in time span of a\nyear\nhow much you end up documenting right\nexactly\nthink about it but it makes you much\nmore proficient it makes you more\ndetail-oriented because\nwho what if you're not here the next day\nand someone calls they need to see what\nyou've done what you've said what you've\ntried no one wants to reinvent the wheel\nso being able to document those\nprocesses and procedures so you can help\nyour fellow uh co-worker out you don't\nwant to leave them in the lurch you know\nwhat i mean and to help future you out\nyou know future them future you like\nyou're doing everybody a service when\nyou're when you're being very thorough\nand documenting your procedures\nyeah nothing's worse than like like you\nknow you go into your ticketing system\nand you search for or maybe someone's\nresolved this you search for you find a\nticket that's like exactly\nthe like the maybe the title is exactly\nthe issue you're having but the\ndocumentation is like oh fixed that's it\n[Laughter]\ndo betteryeah and i went into the service i've\nbeen to like you know with your first\nsort of years in tech and i get this\nquestion a lot i was like when do you\nknow you're ready to take the next step\nlike how much time is an ideal time to\nbe in like that entry-level gig before\ntaking the next step and i know you\nmentioned that you sort of naturally\nstarted to like progress into like the\nnetworking stuff but does anything's\nlike any scenario or any time or an\nexperience sort of like just pop into\nyour mind like that's exactly when i\nknew that that was the next thing that i\nwanted to work on\nwell because i had my foot in both\nworlds right when they started hiring\npeople\nto\ndo help help desk uh specifically that\nwas their role that gave me the ability\nto kind of take my foot off of that\npedal and put it somewhere else like\nthat was when i was able to kind of cut\nthe cord because now i'm on boarding\nthose people right because i still have\nmy job of you know you know\nthey called me a network admin because\nwe did networking and server\nadministration but um\nthat was when it got real because then\nwhen i was totally separated from it\nbecause they had a help desk and i was\nyou know the admin i my role just\nkind of the hat just kind of came on and\ni just stopped doing it because i was in\nthe same company now once i am\ncomfortable and i'm this when you know\nthis admin\ni was like okay\ni'm ready to take this show on the road\nand how do you know how do you know\nyou feel comfortable right i was i was\nat this place for a couple of years\nright and i felt comfortable enough to\nstart one\ngot to see what's out there you know\num i want to work i wanted to work in a\ndifferent uh vertical so i worked in you\nknow business\ni wanted to work in higher ed right i'd\nnever done it i thought it was cool they\nget a lot of vacation i was like okay so\ni started looking for higher education\nphysicians and i found one and that was\nwhen you know this was\ngosh i'm so oldthat was a while ago i think this was\nmaybe\nearly 2000s right so now i am a fully\nfledged\nwindows systems administrator so that\nyou know it took about a good\ni want to say back there\nmaybe four years maybe give or take a\nfew where i had had that\ntransition from secretary to help desk\ngetting that first and second real help\ndesk job getting that height that third\nhybrid job where i kind of grew into the\nthe server and networking piece until it\nwas fully fledged you know\nservers active directory vmware well\nthat was even before vmware came out but\nit was it felt so the growth felt so\norganic like it just came to me um i\nthink if i would have worked in a\ndifferent vertical it could have\nprobably been different\nbut that was just my path and\ni learned so much along the way i\nwouldn't i wouldn't change a thing\nabsolutely i feel like um\nyou know sometimes i i got this question\nthe other day is like did you would you\nhave wished to like start it in cloud\nfrom like you know from a junior club\nengineer being like your first gig in\ntech and i was asked i was asked this\nand i'm like no way\nno way right because i was exposed to so\nmuch the help desk and then the sis\nadmin gig and this is a question i want\nto ask you like what role outside of\nhelp does you think was probably like\nthe most impactful one and if you look\nback and like what year did i or what\nrole did i really just\nlike a software like what i was like was\njust like so hard but like challenged me\nso much like that right um for me it was\nmy sis admin gig and and and\nwhat i was i was saying like for my sis\nadmin gig and then moving into more of\nlike a junior cloud engineer and then\nfull cloud engineering kind of thing\nlike i that would have never happened\nwithout like everything else and every\nsort of tech that i was exposed to and\nnow full circle coming into like my\nadvocacy role it's like i can all talk\nabout tech that i probably wasn't\nworking on as a as a cloud engineer i\nwas doing like sysadmin or help desk and\nthings like that but i wouldn't be able\nto talk about that now if i hadn't had\ngone through all those kinds of things\nright exactly\nso i i wouldn't change it i mean i think\nit's easy to\nsort of like\nwhen you want to get started like go\nstraight into i guess the role that you\nwant to get into or the feeling you want\nto get into but like don't let that stop\nyou from\nmaybe trying out some other things or or\num\nthe only reason i say is because like\nhelp desk is very entry level friendly\num and also i also see helped us girls\nhaving like great educational like\nbenefits where it be like oh maybe we'll\npay for your certifications or we'll pay\nfor your educational content things like\nthat they're like it's so friendly in\nterms of like upscaling their people\nbecause i think managers of these of\nthese roles are very aware like\nyou know this is an entry-level role\npeople don't necessarily want to be here\nforever or maybe some people want to\nmake a career out of it and that's\nfantastic as well um\nand they're just with it they're like\nall right we know you're gonna you know\ndo a few years here let's get you like\nto be like improve your skills and all\nkinds of things i know that was the case\nfor my my role you mentioned that's the\ncase for your yeah you weren't in\nsupport as well\nbut yeah moving on to that question that\ni mentioned about like what which role\nbefore your current role\ni would say\nwas the one that just the most\nchallenging where you feel like you were\njust\nreally really had to put in the work\nreally had to like\nwhich role where you were like i have no\nidea how i'm going to figure this out\nthe most i oh i can tell you that so it\nwas in 2011 all right and i went to this\nuh university and\ni was again\nthe only\nadmin but i wasn't just a windows admin\ni was also the linux admin and linux was\nnot\nmy strong suit it was not my first love\nright so\ni had to learn so much on the job not\nthat i'd never experienced linux because\nlike i told you in my first job you know\nas this network person everything mostly\nyou know other than\nserver you know mail and uh uh file\nservers and things\nlinux was our dns and our dhcp right\nthat's was that was my first foray and i\nkind of played with it in that windows\nassistant position but it wasn't my job\nthey had linux admins 29 2011 i got to\nthis job where i had to do both windows\nand linux\nand i was just like\ni can do this\nand now we're getting to the point where\nit's like there's you know there's\nyoutube there's more information out\nthere there's training i'm learning\nthese things on the fly and we were a we\nhad multiple linux distros and i was\njust like nah i don't even want to do\nthis game because everybody does a\nlittle bit\nsomething a little bit different so i\nwas i was able to help get us to uh\nsettle on a\na platform um and it just happened to be\nreal at the time like\nwe're gonna be a red hat shop like i'm\nnot even playing these games with all\nthese distros so\nthat's where it started like i i felt it\nwhen why was it challenging one because\ni was the only person i had no one to\nlike gotta go to i was used to being\naround people where i could be like\nexcuse me can you help me like yeah\nthere was nobody and it was very\nisolating um i had to level up\nin a way\nthat\ni wasn't used to\nbut i felt that during the course and i\nwas there for eight years\nso\nat some point you know i saw more people\ncome in and it was just like this is my\nthing i got so comfortable\nand i felt like i had not mastered but\nyou know if you're somewhere so long you\nfeel like it's your second skin yeah i\nknow this stuff i know my environment i\nknow what i'm doing and i i loved it\nlike\nso that was the biggest challenge for me\nbut it also felt like the biggest\naccomplishment for me\nand then\nthen things kind of went sideways and i\njust did a whole like so that was like\nbut that was also a catalyst like yeah\ni've gained all this knowledge\nwhat else can i do with it right what\nelse can i do with it so\num\nthat's when i started uh\nthinking about web development so that's\na whole nother story\nthat's all another story i it's\ninteresting that you mentioned linux\nbecause it's one of those the skill sets\nthat i think if people take the time to\njust become comfortable with it anything\nelse that you pick up current day is\ngoing to be substantially easier maybe\ncloud whether that be devops whether\nthat be even uh\nyou know new things like you know even\nprogramming because you know when you\nthink of like bash then you think\nscripting then you think programming\nright\nabsolutely anything you want to dive\ninto having just a just maybe like a\njust being comfortable just\nunderstanding how to use commands how to\nlike\nput together pipelines how to like you\nknow filter your output in the terminal\nthings like that yeah everything else\nbecomes substantially easier because\nwhen you think about like you know cloud\nwhich is all the rage these days right\num\nwhat what is the cloud just a bunch of\nlinux servers right and that worked\ntogether right so yes\nliterally that is all it is yeah and and\nlinux is something that i feel like most\npeople don't tap into at the beginning\nof their like maybe learning i know i\ndidn't i just like go straight into like\nyou know platform like azure aws things\nlike that then some programming and then\nlater on i didn't really become\ncomfortable comfortable with linux until\nmaybe like two years ago\nand at the beginning of this year i\nspent like a solid two to three months\njust doing something different in linux\nevery single day and i wrote like blog\nposts every single day and now you know\ncoming from like full circle now working\na lot more with the azure cli and things\nlike that it's like everything is just\nso much easier because of it and i\nhighly recommend if you want to dive\ninto any field in tech\ngive yourself some time to just learn\nsome linux learn some commands there are\nsome fantastic books out there but\nhonestly if you just use like the man\npages i don't know like what was your\napproach on on on picking up linux i i\nassume like you were just trying to\ntranslate your skills from like your\nwindows to like all right how do i do\nthis to linux right yes that's basically\nwhat it was so let me i'm gonna say this\nmy old boss jeff that gave me that\nopportunity he said to me angela\ni know you like the gui\nbut make sure you can do everything that\nyou're doing in the gui on the command\nline yeah make make that up make it a\npoint\nnow\ni didn't internalize that\nfor a good ten something years like it\ni i would do it for some things and it's\njust like nah it's kind of easier let me\njust do it this way well think about all\nthe time i lost\nright when i didn't internalize that\namazing piece of information\nand i i kicked myself because in 2011 i\ngot into this position and i felt like i\nhad to relearn everything and it was my\nown fault because he had given me such\ngreat advice to me i thought that was it\nwas priceless right um another thing is\nlearning networking\nyou can't i don't want to say you can't\nbut not to be able to understand\nnetworking and how packets move and\ntroubleshooting network issues um\nwithout that comfort level you know\nunderstanding what what a subnet is and\nhow to write like i feel people kind of\njump over that and not really understand\nthose two skills a little bit of\nnetworking and a little bit of linux go\nso far like how can you cloud without\neither\nwith either of those skills\npair them together and you have infinite\npossibilities i feel like\nlike the\ni remember struggling because like\ntraffic wouldn't hit a virtual machine\nand i we had just had no idea how to\ntroubleshoot it right whereas now like\nnow i can put together a virtual network\nnow i can you know divide it properly\nwith subnets you know uh use route\ntables properly use private ip addresses\npublic id addresses\nlike appropriately um you know ssh into\nthings uh you know generate keys and all\nthese kinds of things just like your\nbasics and the the the thing about like\nlike commands like linux and networking\nis that a lot of networking tasks\nare sort of accomplished via commands so\nyou kind of get like you're working on\nboth at the same kind of time so they go\nhand in hand um also i find networking\nfun like i know a lot of people think\nit's boring and things like that but i\nlike being able to like all right this\ndoesn't work i can't like i visit the ip\nand i can't see it let me go figure it\nout let me go see like what's wrong and\nstuff like that also i really like\nnetworking diagrams just looking at them\ni think it's very neat like i want to\nget like some complex ones and print\nthem out and like hang them up i think\nthey look really cool i don't know about\nyou\nthat's pretty cool but i think they they\nlook pretty neatbut yeah absolutely\ngo ahead but absolutely linux and\nnetworking if you have those under your\nyour your tool bed in terms of like\ntoolbox of skills you're you're going to\nbe really set up for success\nand the cloud does do\nlike it does this not a disservice\nobviously but like they abstracts a lot\nof this like you know these things but\nif you understand just a little bit just\nenough to be dangerous\ninfinite infinite possibilities right um\ni i i i want to dive into sort of like\nso you mentioned like you're you just\ncontinuously always learning but in\nterms of like uh like\nwhat you were focused on learning at the\nbeginning where i'm assuming it was a\nlittle bit more general to like where\nyou're at now like do you find yourself\num sort of just trying to keep up with\nthe new things are you more focused on\nlike stuff with your role or like or\nmaybe you give yourself like once a\nmonth to like just try out something\ncompletely different like what does your\nroutine look like in terms of upskilling\nright now it's literally trying to keep\nup with the role um because technology\nmoves fast at a software company you\nknow it's always iterating that because\nwe're we're open source software company\nso just the the level of change that\nhappens across all of the\nproducts is staggering and to be\nsuccessful in my job\ni have to be able to keep\non par with it because i'm talking to\nour customers our clients um helping\nthem you know what i say like we're\ntrying to help them build these\nsolutions i have to be able to talk that\nlanguage as best i can right so it is a\nconstant\nyou know\nlearning the newest thing you know\nstaying up on top of enablement what's\nthe new features reading release notes\ntaking the new courses when they come\nout um it's constant but for somebody\nlike me who really gets a kick out of\njust learning the thing\nlike\nit can be something that i know i'll\nnever use and you would say well that's\nkind of wasteful why would you waste\nyour time on that because everything is\nkind of related to some degree so to be\nable to kind of dive into something that\nmight not be your minor or your major\nbut something ancillary why not kind of\ngo through a little course or this is\nwhy i love youtube there can be\nsomething oh my god i have no idea what\nthis means i don't know how it interacts\nsearch for the term probably somebody\nhas done a video on it right yeah\ntrouble you know someone's\nsomeone's already done the work for you\nso why not you know look at their\ncontent see if it'll help um see if it\nexpands your understanding you know um i\nyou know i think\nthe the greatest thing anybody can ever\ndo is put content out there that's\nhelping people\nfor free because y'all don't have to do\nit like we're always relying on the\nstack overflows and you know using\ngoogle to within an inch of its life\nyeah um\nwe don't have this is how we do things\nnow\nwhen i started there was no google so\neither you know it or you didn't so it's\nlike i love the fact that information is\njust at our fingertips now and it's just\nit's there if we want it and because\nsome people just want it\nthen this this is an amazing time to be\nin this field because it's so much out\nthere and and it's for the taking\nabs absolutely i think now is\nif you want it you'll find a way to get\nat it\neducation i think um\nis i guess the lack of educational\ncontent is not the the\nwhat it was before like i even look at\nlike cloud specific educational content\nfrom when i was getting aws certified\nwhich was my first certification which i\nwant to talk to you about certification\na little bit um but i think it was 2016\nthat i started to\nreally sit down and study every single\nday like two hours aws stuff and i look\nat the the the the educational cloud\nspace now it's completely different and\nwe just think like that's only like a\ndifference of like four to five years\nright yeah now it's just like back then\nyou could probably find like so the aws\nlike the certified solution architect\nassociate which is probably like the\nmost popular one and i was studying for\nthe developer one it was tough it was\nlike my couple courses out there and i\ntook absolutely everything that i could\nfind and now it's like there's new stuff\nevery single day right so now it's like\nit's like the best time\ni mean obviously\ni think it's always going to be the best\ntime because i think just this the tech\nspace now is just forever changed it's\nlike if you want to get into it\nthere's no real real\nnothing really stopping you in terms of\neducation i mean i just think like\nthat's just going to get better and\nbetter and better and better obviously\nyou get the issues of like you know who\ni didn't really know what is quality and\nstuff like that but i think you know\nwe're never really going to get rid of\nthat you just kind of have to like dive\ninto it if it doesn't work for you it\ndoesn't work also something that might\nwork for you might not work for me you\nknow give things a try you know put\nyourself put yourself give yourself the\nopportunity to learn how you learn right\nlike that's like so important like are\nyou more a video person you're more a\ntext person you're more book person\ntutorial person like whatever it might\nbe\nthere's something out there for you yeah\nbut like like i wanted to type into\ncertifications because i feel like they\nmost of us have like a love-hate\nrelationship with certifications i think\nyou know uh i if you're on linkedin if\nyou're on twitter it's so easy for to\nsee someone who i don't know takes like\n30 certifications uh a month and then\nsomeone who's like completely bashing on\nthem saying that they're completely\nuseless or something like that right\ni want to hear your take on him do you\nhave any are you maybe studying for any\ndo you plan on taking some for the\nfuture i know red hat certifications\nhave just always been in demand i i hear\nabout people studying for red hat\ncertifications like every single day i\nget comments on my channel about red hat\nall these kinds of things i know they're\npretty tough as well so yeah i want to\nhear i want to hear your opinion on\ncertifications\nso\npersonally i before i got here i never\nhad to have a certification\nbut i found them as an amazing vehicle\nto\nlearn some foundational information\nabout x right so i took you know lpi\nlinux essentials um i've taken um the\ncloud practitioner i taken the uh aws\nsolution architect\nthey were just amazing primers right if\nyou want to learn something very\nfoundational\nthese companies that are uh putting\nthese uh resources together to\nespecially because it's their product\nthey want you to know their product so\nthey're gonna give you the opportunity\nwith that one year free trial to use as\nmuch as their product as you possibly\ncan especially if you're studying for a\ncertification um i think they're a great\nway to get some foundational information\nnow the way that certifications have\ngone they have given you the opportunity\nto take more advanced certifications so\nyou can build upon all of the knowledge\nthat you've acquired taking those\nprevious certifications\nthat is priceless like i am pro-certand not even if you're taking them to um\noh i need this cert i need i need to get\nall the search i'm collecting them like\npokemon cards that's cool too but what\nyou're doing is you're learning\nsomething very foundational and if you\ntake subsequent exams you're building\nupon that knowledge and\nthat to me is like that's the money shot\ni if even if you don't want to take the\nexam and you've gone through the\nmaterials and you know the work and\nyou've\nso what like you can't that no one can\ntake that away from you right yeah\nsearch expire right yeah they do you got\nto re-up and do things like that that's\ncool too um i know they're not for\neverybody people some people don't test\nwell not to say that they don't know the\ncontent but testing in certain scenarios\ncan be very stressful for people so i\nget that um the adaptive exams are super\nhard you know people say oh true false\nyou know multiple choice yeah that's\neasy you know and\nyou never know how people can can\nperform in those types of situations one\nyou're timed two you've never\nthey they may be wording things that\nyou've never seen worded this way so it\nis a challenge so\nusually you're being watched exactly so\nlike you know you don't want to move\nyour mouth because someone might think\nyou're talking to somebody on the other\nside like you have to be so it is such a\nstressful stressful um time so shout out\nto anybody who\nis currently studying for an exam who\nhas taken exams who understand their\nvalue\nand if you've never studied for an exam\nlike\nyou know i don't know how you can speak\nto it because you've never done it but\nthe just going through that process of\nlike doing the learning from beginning\nto end to learn something um i think\nthat's invaluable\nyou you touched upon a couple of things\ni i 1000 agree and sort of want to echo\na little bit on\none where certifications are now and\nwhere they're headed is i think very\ndifferent than where they started i\nthink it was a lot easier for you to\nmemorize things to use exam dumps and\nthings like that for previous versions\nof certifications where now you have\nyour specialties with now you have a lot\nmore lab focus a lot of sort of like or\nlike case study focused kind of things\nwhere yes there might be multiple choice\nbut it's kind of hard for you to like\njust memorize things which i love i love\ncertifications are also headed to more\nrole based and then like super general\nso you can get as\nlike as specific as you'd like right\nsecurity identity um\nadministration devops architecture all\nthose kinds of things now have their own\nset of certifications exactly and when\nyou think about like all right let's\nthink about like you want to be a cloud\nengineer then maybe you're going to do\nsome azure ones some aws ones some gcp\nones but you can also go and get some\nlinux ones some security ones you can\nalso you can really build your own sort\nof like degree\num it's not gonna be like four i mean i\nguess you could put like four years\nworth of certifications like put it\ntogether right\nyou could really give yourself like like\ni don't know let's say like six months\nin each month you're studying for one\nand but you're really taking your time\nto dive into that content and\npersonalize it for you\nand when you compare like certifications\nlike the cost of a certification which\noften times you can get your job to pay\nfor\nthat's true just like a fun fact or like\na tip for you to look into for the chat\nto look into in terms of like hey maybe\nyour job's willing to pay um\nit's a lot more affordable than\ntraditional college traditional like\ndegree programs or anything like that\nright and i just think overall they're\ngreat i i personally love i i have an\nexpired aws certification which was my\nfirst class for vacation i have the az\n900 which is the azure fundamental\ncertification and i only took that\nbecause i so i have a love-hate\nrelationship with tech twitter sometimes\nthere's just some tweets that like\nreally getting to like like kind of like\nget under my skin and i know i shouldn't\nbe this way but i'm just being honest um\nand it was someone saying that uh like\noh the az900 is like so easy like it's\nsuch a pointless certification things\nlike that and i was like and i was like\nyou know what i'm gonna take it for\nmyself because i don't want to speak\nupon things that like i knew it wasn't\neasy just because i saw the content and\ni was thinking i was like a beginner but\ni had had at that point like two years\nof azure experience i'm like i'm not\ngonna study i'm just gonna go take it\ni barely pass that certification barely\nwhen i'm saying i was like i'm pretty\nsure if i got one more question wrong i\nwould have not passed it so the only\nreason i took it was because i want to\nbe able to tell like people you know i\nhad my youtube channel i'm going to be\nable to tell people like this is a great\nplace for you to start and entry level\ncertifications are also newer like i\nthey were like it was like associate\nlevel the professional level and then\nentry level ones are like introduced\nand overall i just wanted the experience\nof taking one so i could you know sort\nof recommend to others right i don't\nwant to just like recommend things i\nhaven't done\nand then i have the linux essentials\nwhich is\nmy favorite certification that i've ever\nlike and i've studied for like the the\nthe the azure um sort of like the\nequipment the solution architect one and\ni've studied for like a bunch of them i\njust haven't taken any of them\num\nmainly because i don't know i just don't\nlike scheduling things\nbut i've studied a lot of content around\nit's a commitment yeah yeah it's like oh\nwill i mean i think i'll be available at\n11 but i don't really know i want the\noption to not have to like be available\nat 11 kind of thing right but i would\nstudy the content every day because i\ngenuinely enjoy it um but studying for\nthat linux certification linux essential\nwhich is like like i guess one of the\nlike the most entry level it's the lpi\nthe one that you mentioned yeah um\nthat was it was tough it would that took\nme three months of studying every single\nday getting hands-on with the command\nlag\nwriting notes and stuff like that it was\nprobably one of the best time i've had\nstudying for something ever really\nawesome that's awesome you have a best\nyou have a best time studying for a cert\ni have a best time studying for a\ncertain i have to tell you that story\nbut continue to continue yeah absolutely\nand i and i think um\nyou mentioned like people you know sort\nof like collecting mall like pokemon\ncards and things like that uh\nyou know everyone i guess everyone has\ntheir reasons and things like that i i\nthink your your time is best spent in my\npersonal opinion is you know grabbing\nthings that are fundamental uh and are\ndefinitely going to help your current\nrole and where you want to get to and\nthings like that but you could probably\nfind uh like hands-on projects that you\ncan work on that might be worth a little\nbit more of your time than studying for\nanother cert or something like that so\nyou kind of like just pair things mix\nthings up uh and don't necessarily you\nhave to like worry about getting every\nsingle certification out there like i\nthink azure has like i don't know 20\ncertifications now you don't need them\nall uh\nso like don't necessarily worry about\nthat but like a couple of\nsolid certifications some projects and\nand in terms of like getting started or\ngetting into the field uh and you're\ngood to go but i would love to hear\nabout like a cert that you you you\nreally enjoyed studying for yes so it\nwas the aws certified solution architect\nand\nso it's fun\nit's a tough one that one was i i had\nput out on twitter like i love twitter\nshout out to twitter shout out to\nlindsay so i said i wanted to study with\nsomeone to take this exam like i just\nfelt like\ni wanted to do this with somebody right\ni've never done this before\num this young lady she's in spain\nyou know she's from milwaukee she lives\nin spain she replied we studied together\nthree times a week for about two months\nright i've never met this woman we had\nthe best time it was\nlearning from her because you know she\nwas newer to tech than i was and i'm\nbeing able to impart some wisdom to her\nbecause you know\nshe hadn't done these things so we\nlearned and bounced off of each other we\nhad scheduled our exams for the same day\nshe had to go to a whole nother town\nlike she had to get a hotel and stay\nsomewhere because it was so remote from\nwhere she was right right right so she\nhad to make travel arrangements go to\nthis place where she can take this exam\nme i just drove up 95 and went to this\nyou know went to the testing center and\nwe scheduled it for the same day and we\nboth passed\nand it was i bet that felt amazing best\nfeeling ever like we worked so hard we\nlearned from each other we learned a lot\ni mean you can't help but have learned a\nlot it was 2018\num or 2019 whatever it was i don't know\n2019 because it's my exam my cert\nexpires next year\nshe hit me up she was like you know our\ncert expires next year we're gonna do\nthis again right i was like i wouldn't\nwant to do it any other way with not\nanother person i had the\nand i've had some bad certain\nexperiences like i failed and and think\nyou know it you go in and you still fail\nyou like okay i'm about the dumbest like\nyou just\nbe i'm so hard on myself\nso\nfor some people failing a certification\nmeans nothing it's like i'll try it\nagain for me\nit shakes me to my core because i like\nto learn and i feel like i've kind of\nmastered so\nmaybe i have to figure out how to not be\nso caught up and like yeah you failed\nyou know just do it again and i'm i'm\nworking on that i'm i'm not there yet\nbut i'm working on that um just that\nconfidence um and you learn something at\nevery pass\nin my opinion you know\nif you fall down get back up oh where\nwhat what uh what domains did i screw up\nokay let me go back in here and you look\nat them with a different set of eyes\nright you know you know what you saw you\nknow what needs to be tweaked in your\nhead\nand you approach it more holistically\nand when you get that opportunity to go\nback in and sit down and you like crush\nit\nman that feels goodand i imagine like not you're not only\nstudying for you now you're also\nstudying because you know how much it\nmatters to your study buddy right and\nthen i think this is just a fantastic\nexample of how much power and how much\nsort of like you can improve when you\nlean into community\nand i think in tech\nif you're not on um\nmaybe on social media or something like\nthat it's easy for you to feel like tech\nis just about\nskill skills skills skills what's the\nnext thing what's the next thing what's\nthe next thing and we often forget that\nwe're people like we you know you\nadmitting to the fact that failure with\ncertifications kind of like uh makes you\nfeel some kind of way the fact that i've\nthat i've like you know i've said like\noh when people say certain things on on\non social media like it kind of gets\nunder my skin and stuff like that we i\nthink we don't have these spaces in tech\nas much as like other fields where we\ncan just talk about like just being\nhumans that we're humans in this in this\nspace in this field and how much power\nwe can get from leaning into our\ncommunity um\nhaving conversations like these i i love\nthis idea of having a study buddy and\nlike maybe a study group and it's\nactually something that i've been trying\nto sort of plan with here with the\nreactor and stuff like that so i'll have\nto like i'll have to like we'll have to\nchat a little bit more about this maybe\nsee if we can come up with something i'd\nbe like but just fantastic but um i\nwanted to talk to you a little bit more\nabout\ncommunity and and and how\nmainly how do you do such a good job of\nnot just being\n100 tech because like i mentioned like\nat the beginning of the stream you know\ni i\nlike the tweets that most impact me from\nyou are like this wonderful technical\ncontent but like the ones that remind me\nto like get up and stretch\nand sort of like that work-life balance\nthat you have are just like fantastic\nand what are some things that you do to\nsort of strike that balance what's your\nrelationship with work-life balance what\nare some maybe advice that you have for\nfor other people in the field on how to\naccomplish that\nwell i used to not be a remote worker i\nworked in an office with a team and i\nloved it like i liked that sense of\nbeing around people because people you\nknow as an introvert you would say oh my\ngod people but there were certain people\nthat i could kind of lean on and i miss\nthat community right i miss having those\nfolks around so now that i'm 100 remote\nit is\ntrying to you have to get creative you\nknow we've really had to get creative\nover the past couple of years and i\nfound that um i was really this is\nactually pre-covet where i was really\nheavily into like the code newbies um\nuh community and i've met amazing people\nin that community i was heavily into my\nlocal gdi chapter girl develop it um\nthey're not the same as they were many\nmany years ago but i leaned into that\ncommunity because to be honest there\nweren't a lot of when women sysadmins\nright i'm talking early 2000s i would go\nto conferences and meet and they weren't\neven meetups and i'm the only person who\nlooks like me and it's like\npeople aren't really friendly and i'm\nnot really outgoing and it was just\nreally weird but these communities were\nso welcoming right they accepted you\nwhoever you were whatever your questions\nwere no question was too dumb you know\neverybody had something to contribute so\nthose are the spaces that i treasure the\nmost um\nso much so i had started one around\npython i started one around the security\nplus and these people are now a part of\nmy tribe like you know even though i've\nkind of like backed away or have moved\nto different things\nyou still can lean on that community\nbecause everybody has a question\neverybody is trying to move forward\neveryone's trying to find a new job and\ni find that i have thrived and grown as\na person because of these communities um\nit i appreciated them for everything\nthat they've given to me and i'm always\ngiving back to them because it's not a\none-way street you know you can't take\nwithout giving and um i'm just very\ngrateful for all those communities that\nhave helped me become this person right\nnow if it weren't for communities i\ndon't think i would be at red hat\nif it weren't for communities i wouldn't\nbe doing this podcast right so\nyou have to you know\nbe mindful of what it gives and always\nbe willing to give back to it that's\njust my personal thing 1 000 i tweeted\nthis i think it was yesterday or this\nmorning that i\nwas able to turn my youtube channel into\na role at microsoft and youtube being\nsuch like a community driven kind of\nthing and the fact that like community\nhas given so much to me and i've like\ngiven so much to them it's like you\nnever really know what anything can turn\ninto these days you don't know who\nyou're going to meet you're not you\ndon't know what you're going to learn\nand stuff like but lean into it but\ndon't forget to also as much as you\nreceive give but give out of like you\nknow\ntry to make connections because you\ngenerally want to make connections not\nbecause of like oh i need to get this\noverview yeah right you work and things\nlike that one thing i wanted to ask\nbefore i know we have like a few more\nminutes and and if the chat has any\nquestions let us know right now because\ni know you're not running on a tight\nschedule but\nwhat's it like working at red hat and\nwhat's also like what's the difference\nbetween working what you've that you've\nnoticed between working at like a small\ncompany to just like an absolutely\nmassive company\ngirl it is like night and day right it's\nnice you know i would you know walk down\nthe hall and it would be like cheers and\neveryone's like norm and everyone knows\nyour name and it's awesome and then you\ncome you know you're you're a big fish\nin a little pond and then you come to\nred hat and it's like\nokay um who do i ask for you know how do\ni get access to this because one we're\nall remote how do you build that that\nrapport it is so different it's a great\ncompany it's a huge company the the um\nopportunities i i find that people i've\nmet so many people who say oh i didn't\nstart doing this oh i was here a couple\nof years and i wanted to do something\nelse and i pivoted like\nand it's like how can you like turn on a\ndime like that well red hat affords you\nthe opportunity right it gives you the\nopportunity to grow into different roles\nyou're never stuck\nwhere you are right i'm a solution\narchitect now who knows where i'll be in\ntwo years five years right i it could be\nanything and that's that's the benefit\nof working at such a huge company that\nhas you know that does a lot of good um\ni have to give i have it's the end of\nthe year it was you know giving tuesday\nand i'm filling out like i'm donating to\nall these charities what do they do\nmatch right so that is huge i've never\nhad that opportunity right so they're\nhelping me be a better person you know\nit's just like\nand i know there's no company that's\nperfect there's no panacea for the\nperfect job the perfect role but\nif you get a place that kind of listens\nto you\nand allows you room\nto wiggle and grow and to make mistakes\nand fail fast you know that is very\nimportant i i i was very afraid of that\nwhen i first got here\nbut\ni'm always it's like you know what screw\nit up now learn from it and this is\nthe people around you support you in\nthat where they because they're human\ntoo they make mistakes i think red hat\ndoes that really well that sense of\ncommunity and openness\npermeates\nthrough everybody um and you know once\nyou drink the kool-aid it comes really\nit becomes really a part of you and and\ni think\nwhen you're getting started it's sort of\nhard for you to feel like that you'll\never be in a place where you're just\nfulfilled where you feel like you can\ntruly truly grow into what you want to\nand discover things that you may not\neven know that you're interested in or\nroles that you may not even know that\nyou're interested in but trust me the\nopportunities are are out there you will\nhave to put in the work and your\ntimeline might look completely different\nthan ours yes\nbut you know it's it's doable there is\nso so many jobs out there in tech um and\nand i mean you're if you you you know\nput in the work obviously\nstudy a lot study a lot get hands-on and\nlike now with like you know\nhow easy it is to spin up a linux vm and\nsign up in a free trial here and there\nlike it's so easy to get hands on now\nversus like remember you probably had to\nlike actually physically rack stuff\nbefore right yes\nyes ma'am\nand i don't miss that at all\nnow you just have to like click clicking\nor maybe a few commands and then you got\na vm speaker exactly although i do have\na rack with some servers in my office\nbut that's a whole nother story\nthat's that's the that's the old me not\nbeing able to let go i think\nbut i mean it's still pretty cool to\nlike find ways to get physically hands\non with tech when it's all just behind\nthe screen i can't i i've been wanting\nto start my whole my own home lab\nbut you know we'll probably have to dive\ninto that and oh yeah\noh definitely i would love to talk about\nhomelands\nyeah awesome um and i one last the\nabsolute last question is yes you could\nrecommend everyone in the chat to learn\nsomething\nand like pick up something today what\nwould it be like maybe like your\nfavorite skill or something\nwe always talk about the technical linux\ni think anyone who's if you're a\ndeveloper if you're ux if you're cloud\nif you're devops linux is the skill to\nlearn\nbut we have to be mindful that our soft\nskills are just important and i don't\nreally like the fact that they're called\nsoft skills but you need to be human and\nyou need to meet people where they are\nand you need to see the humanity in\npeople so if you have like a big head\nego where you thinking your poop don't\nstink like you really need to know how\nto approach people and be kind like if\nyou can't be that and you think you're\ngoing to work in tech no one's going to\nwant to help you like you all you're\nbecause you don't know everything right\nyou always have to reach out and\nsometimes get some assistance um you\nhave to give it to get it i think so\nbeing kind is definitely having great\npeople skills having great communication\nskills and i know you said more one um\nbut\nthe humanity of people sometimes get\nleft behind and i think that is an\nimportant thing that we sometimes need\nto focus on you know\ni think it's a solid combo linux and\ncommunication skills yes\ni love it\nangela thank you so much for joining me\ni know rebecca usually hops on at the\nend of the stream to just give everyone\na little a little reminder i dropped a\ncouple of links uh to your twitter to\nthe podcast that you do at red hat that\ni i i recently listened to the one about\ntech hubs and i listened to the one\nabout um technical interviews as well\nthat was a couple of months back yeah\nfor some research that i was doing but\neveryone go check that out thank you so\nmuch for for joining\nus in chat make sure you follow angel on\ntwitter it was a pleasure\nwe'll we'll we'll do this again for sure\nabsolutely we'll have to\nmake this a recurring thing or something\nlike that all right all right take care\neverybody thank you thank you all so\nmuch",
