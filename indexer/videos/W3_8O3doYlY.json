  "title": "Which Cloud Platform Should Beginners Learn in 2023?",
  "transcript": "the reality is that the answer to this\nquestion\nis going to be it depends but i'm going\nto give you some advice as to how you\ncan\nmake this decision\ni think a lot of people\nand this is more tailored towards\nbeginners because it's usually beginners\nwho are asking the question which cloud\nshould i learn\nonce you have experience with one cloud\nplatform you already know that\nwhich cloud i need to learn will depend\non my employer my job project needs all\nthese kinds of things right but for\nbeginners with no experience it's hard\nto sort of have that mindset because you\nknow you haven't been through it that's\ncompletely fine\ni think beginners tend to go to\nto google and then they find personal\nopinions or they go on twitter and they\nfind like these\nlike opinions by like tech twitter\ninfluencers or whatnot about like yeah\nyou have to learn aws because of this\nyou have to learn azure because of this\nyou have to learn gcp because of this\nyou know\nthe argument i hear a lot is\nyou just have to learn aws because it\nhas more market share\ni think that is a flawed answer i think\nanyone who gives you a definitive answer\nwithout asking you a little bit more\ndetails is giving you\nan opinion and not a fact and i think\nthat can be\nyou know just like not the best option\nfor people who are getting started\nso for me it's\nusually three-step kind of\nprocess when i provide this advice\nand i kind of wanted to abstract it into\nthis video so i could share this with\nanyone who asks me this question\nbut your first step is to go and find\njobs that you want to work at\nand\nthat depends on a lot that depends on\nlike which jobs you're eligible for\nwhere you're located now a lot\nmore jobs are offering remote options\nwhich i think is awesome\nso you could be working or living in one\narea and working in a different area but\neven that like there's like restrictions\nand laws and just like a bunch of things\nthat are\nvery very unique to your situation so if\nyou ask me like hey which clash should i\nlearn and i tell you azure like\nand then you go and learn azure and\nthere's no azure jobs in your area or\nazure jobs that you're interested in\nlike what is that gonna\nhow am i giving you good advice right\nnow what i've been seeing a lot lately\nis that oftentimes these job\ndescriptions will say either\noh experience with azure or aws\nexperience with aws or gcp experience\nwith all clouds or experience with i e\neither of the big three clouds right\nso then you're gonna tell me you know\nhey gps like i'm looking at these\ndescription and descriptions and they\nsay like any of these jobs would be\ngreat and i'm like okay cool\nso then my next piece of advice would be\npick the cloud that sort of you can set\nyourself up for success to learn\nbecause you're surrounded more by that\nand what i mean by this is\ndo you have colleagues who know aws then\nbecause you're you know could ask them\nfor advice you could ask them for\nsupport that might be a good decision\nfor you\nmaybe you don't have colleagues but\nmaybe you have like friends or or maybe\nyou're at school and you have um\nclassmates\nmaybe there's family members who work\nwith it or have learned it or something\nlike that\nanother good thing is meetups in your\narea\nare there azure meetups are there\naws meetups are there gcp meetups\ncommunities online communities which\nones do you find more um\nlike that are more available to you\nanything like that all rightso then that should help you narrow it\ndown um\nif you still at that point can't\ndecide for some reason and i really find\nit hard to not i think honestly the\nfirst one will\nlike at least get you down to two and\nthen the next one will get you hopefully\nto make your decision but my last uh\nsort of piece of advice would be to okay\neach cloud platform has in a fun\nfoundational fundamental certification\nso azure has the azure the az900 aws has\nthe certified cloud practitioner i don't\nknow what the google one is called\nbut go and\nlook at those certifications download\nthe outlines and start studying for\neach one of those\ni think at this point it's just\nbeneficial for you to pick between two\nwhichever two you want to hopefully that\nwould have been narrowed down from the\nsteps before\nbut i'm going to use the example of aws\nand azure mainly because those are like\nthe ones that tend to have more\ncommunity meetups more content just\nbecause they've been around longer\nthat's it\nbut gcp is doing a great job with their\ndevrel and their in their content\ndepartment\nand i can see that catching up\nreally quick so\nbut for this example i'm gonna\nyou know keep it to aws and azure\nand\nyou know go and study for both of them\nif you're brand new i believe that\nthe either one would take you like a\nmonth to do\nonce you study for them\nget a feel for how you\nhow how the content was because both of\nthem offer free content how uh\ninteracting with the communities we're\nlike interacting with azure communities\non twitter uh go to a couple meetups if\nyou can same thing with aws things like\nthat\nattend some virtual meetups if there are\nany conferences conferences attend the\nvirtual conferences just get a feel for\nwhich one you know you enjoy more\nand then from there once you make a\ndecision go and build like you know the\ncloud resume challenge and whatever\nplatform you want to do\nif you still can't decide build them\nboth\nbut i think at that point\nyour goal is to to get to as quick as\nyou can to pick one and then just you\nknow learn that one\nand once you get to a comfortable state\nwith one platform you can go and learn\nanother one because you have your\nfundamentals in one platform right it's\nnot that if you pick azure you're going\nto be azure for the rest of your life\nnow\ni've shared my story millions of times\nbut\ni picked aws ended up\nlanding an azure job\nand it's been azure ever since then\nyeah it's not like you pick one and it's\nlike your fate for the rest of your life\nnow\nso anyway i hope this provides more\ncontext i truly do believe that anyone\nthat gives you a definitive answer\nwithout having a proper conversation\nwith you is you doing you and doing the\ncommunity a disservice\nbut yeah these are sort of three steps\nthat hopefully can help you\nmake the\ndecision\nfor yourself and empower you to go and\nyou know figure out what the right\ndecision for yourself is\nbecause that's an important skill set as\nwell when you get into a role\nyou\noften won't be told\nhey this is exactly what you have to do\ngo do it like step one do this step two\nlike no you'll have an idea of what you\nhave to get done and then you gotta go\nfigure out how to get it done um\nthe first decision of picking which\ncloud\nto go and learn is already an\nopportunity to\nbuild on that skill set so set yourself\nup for success\nuh and i hope this was helpful all right\ni'll see you in the next video",
