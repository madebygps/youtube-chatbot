  "transcript": "mm-hmmoh yeah I'm on the I'm on it already I\nthinkyepthank youyeah sounds goodoh okayall right everyone hi uh so sorry I know\neveryone could hear us before I'm trying\nout this new like streaming uh sort of\nlike back end\nand uh\nsort of last minute I tested it a little\nbit yesterday I'm not 100 familiar with\nit but anyway hi uh take a few minutes\nto come to the chat tell us where you're\nchecking in from all those good things\nbut yeah I have uh Lucy here Lucy I've\nbeen wanting to talk to you for a long\ntime\num so I'm very happy to have you here\nbut why don't you give us like I don't\nknow a 30 second introduction before I\nstart just hitting you with questions\nyeah first of all great to be here uh\nyeah for those watching welcome and this\nis actually the second time\num I've met Gwen\num and so it's like a lot of people just\nassume we kind of like met before\nalready but yeah today we're going to be\ntalking about you know all things\nrelated Solutions Architects but just\nhaving a chat as well\num around like YouTube and things like\nthat as well but yeah so\num a bit of an introduction I'm Tech\nwith Lucy otherwise you know Lucy Wang\nand uh I started off my Journey on\nYouTube around 20 around two years ago\nso that's when I started off\num also my Solutions Arctic role at AWS\nso bit of background I worked at AWS for\ntwo and a half years and last week I\nactually quit my job to do YouTube\nfull-time uh but yeah today as I\nmentioned happy to chat about all things\nrelated to what it's like being a\nSolutions architect at AWS any YouTube\nquestions as well or just like you know\nany questions around cloud in general\nhappy to help answer\nI we started our YouTube Journey around\na similar time I'm I think I might have\nstarted before you\nand and I I told you this because full\ndisclosure to people in the audience\nwe've our the first time we actually had\na proper conversation like actually just\nyou and me talking was was that two days\nago or yeah yeah two days ago right we\nsat down for like 30 minutes just to do\na little bit of a tech check and then\num and I I remember telling you that I I\nsaw you like you started your channel\nand then everything just kind of like\ntook off for you for the last couple of\nmonths and now when I think of cloud and\nlike specifically AWS you're just like\nthe person to go to in my opinion so\ncongratulations that is a lot of work as\nsomeone who does YouTube as well and and\nyou know doing it with a full-time job\nthat takes a lot\num it's not like you know you get to do\nit on the job or\num it's something easy to do you know\npeople will see like an eight minute ten\nminute video but that's probably on\naverage what two to four hours maybe\neven more depending on how much research\nyou had to do and all those kinds of\nthings so you know I'm not surprised\nconsidering how smart and disciplined\nyou are that you are at where you're at\nand I know you made this big change in\nyour career too I would love to talk a\nlittle bit more about that I'm sure\npeople have questions but let's start\nfrom the from the from the beginning\nwhen when did you Lucy know that you had\nan interest in cloud computing or how\ndid that happen\nwas it like earlier on in school or is\nit something that sort of came later on\nor did you get into AWS first and then\nyou were like oh this seems kind of cool\nyeah definitely not in school I didn't\nreally hear much about the cloud in high\nschool or university uh I think yeah it\nis when I actually started my internship\nat AWS because I joined in a\nnon-technical role so I didn't really\nknow too much about the cloud side of\nthings I kind of joined because I found\nthe role to be interesting\num and so yeah it didn't really get too\nmuch Cloud exposure and as a lot of\npeople know as well Cloud isn't really\ntaught in University\num I think it's decided to introduce it\nto the curriculum now uh but yeah my\njourney with text started off pretty\nmuch with AWS I did study information\nsystems in University so it was a degree\nat combined business and Tech and got to\nlearn about the applications of\nTechnology like you know for businesses\nbut yeah like at the time I was just\nkeeping my options open looking at\nConsulting companies looking at tech\ncompanies and just\num where I could you know find like you\nknow a career to build within that kind\nof space but only Niche down into Cloud\nI would say yeah after joining AWS and\nyou know like being architect did you\nhave any\ncertifications prior to coming into AWS\nno no certifications before AWS I would\nhave done certifications I think if my\nrole was a technical role but my\ninternship was a non-technical role so I\nwasn't working with like Cloud at all\num I did do four certifications before I\nstarted my Solutions acting role because\nat the time I wanted to you know like\nimprove my cloud skills right and then\njust help make the transition easier so\ndid four sets uh before starting the\nfull-time role okay awesome so but I\nwant to talk a little bit more about the\nsearch but before that I think something\nthat there I feel like people always ask\nis landing internships while you're at\nschool can you can you talk a little bit\nmore about like how that happened for\nyou and what kind of things you felt\nhelped you stand out or help you like\nland actual internships at like a\nmassive company like AWS\nyeah uh I haven't talked about this in a\nwhile now because people usually just\nask me about how to get into the\nfull-time role um but this is something\nI'm really interested in as well\num I think what helped me stand out was\njust the work I was doing with the\nuniversity so I was pretty involved in\nthe student Society space doing case\ncompetitions just trying to improve\nmyself skills and just like problem\nsolving skills because I knew that you\nknow that not only helped me build up my\nskills you know things that I wouldn't\nbe able to learn through University\nclasses but also just help increase my\nnetwork of people as well so\num met a lot of incredible mentors as\nwell throughout my time at University\nand I think that just came from getting\ninvolved wherever I can in the student\nclubs and things like that\num specifically for getting into AWS\nthat was actually I didn't end up just\nyou know applying through the job portal\nI saw a job posting or like you know the\nhiring manager shared on LinkedIn that\nthey were looking for an intern so I\nliterally just I like the post and then\nI just messaged the hiring manager is\nawesome yeah and then that whole process\njust started with like putting me in\ncontact with the recruiter and then just\nstarting this interview process pretty\nmuch the next day the next day was when\nthe phone interview was\num so I would say like think about\nunconventional ways like you know like\nnot the typical ways to like learn an\ninternship because I think at this point\nit's pretty hard to stand out in a way\nlike because there's so many people\ninterested in the same roles and\nespecially with that kind of freezes and\nthings happening yeah it is quite\nLimited in the positions\num so yeah like things like reaching out\nto recruiters posting on LinkedIn like\nokay that could also work be before\nlanding your internship you didn't have\na YouTube channel because you said you\nstarted that while you were at uws\ncorrect\nso in terms of any kind of online\npresence where\num were you doing anything else or did\nyou have sort of anything uh that you\nwould say help you stick that or was it\nlike primarily LinkedIn and the stuff\nthat you were doing at school\nyeah I think mainly at school um I\nstarted a student Society it was called\nthe unsw Digital Society so all I know\nabout people helping people get into\nTech so naturally that got me pretty\ninvolved in um kind of so my role was\nco-president but also I was working with\nthose companies recruiters to host\nevents together for the University\ncampus so I think that was quite a\ninteresting role and I think that took\nup a lot of time as well so that I\ndidn't really have much time to do\nthings like YouTube or stuff stuff like\nthat but yeah I can't imagine that was\nkind of like my main starting point\num or like things that something that\nmade me stand out but yeah everyone like\njust needs to find their own thing like\nwhether that be posting on YouTube\ncreating a Blog\num getting involved in Societies in so\nmany ways so it's it's good advice do\nyou have any LinkedIn advice like any\nany tips you have maybe on the top of\nyour head that you feel people should\ntake more advantage of or Implement in\ntheir own profiles\num yeah\num I realize on LinkedIn the posts that\ndo well and just like people who have a\nlarge presence on LinkedIn don't\nnecessarily have to be like the subject\nmatter expert in what they're talking\nabout a lot of them just documenting\ntheir Journey so let's say\num you start your study for a cloud\ncertification or you'll build a car\nproject I think just making a post just\ndocumenting what you build listing out\num the steps you took and just providing\nsome like advice to students who are\nalso Journey can really go a long way as\nwell okay so just having that mindset\nthat you don't need to be an expert\nbefore you start posting on LinkedIn\nlike I I love that advice\num you know you're talking about\nprojects and certifications and I when\nyou think cloud you think um sort of\ngetting into Cloud\num everyone thinks certifications is\nsuch a popular topic and I know you have\nyou have a lot of videos on it I've done\nsome videos on it as well uh but I want\nto hear more about sort of your journey\nwith certifications what was the first\none what was the last one you got what\nwhich one do you feel like was the most\nuseful let's start with that first let's\nstart actually let's let's take it one\nby one because I have a lot of questions\nhere and I'm sure the chat will have a\nlot of questions here as well but what\nwas the first certification you got and\nhow long did it take you to study for\nthat one\nyeah so first one was the AWS Cloud\npractitioner certification uh that one\ntook me about three weeks to do\npart-time so I think around two hours a\nday\num\nyou know go through the course material\nand also the practice exams as well\num yeah that was the first one\nwhat was the study approach for you like\nbecause I I'm that was your first Cloud\ncertification right\nyeah and\nwas it significantly harder sort of\nbecause you're coming out of school and\nat school you're sort of kind of know to\nstudy like a certain way and do you feel\nlike the way you study for your\ncertification was a little different\nwhat was that approach look like how was\nthat learning process for you\nyeah I actually found it easier because\nin University there's a few courses that\njust aren't interesting and you're like\nwhy am I learning this\num a lot of studying in University was\nkind of like studying for the sake of it\nwhereas this one I knew that all the\nknowledge that I'll gain from\npersonification will actually be quite\nuseful if especially if I was to stay in\nAWS so I was a lot more motivated to\nstudy for that so that's why sometimes I\nalways recommend to people like always\nknow your why like before you even study\nlike why what's your end goal like why\ndo you want to study for certification\nis it to land a job in the future is it\nbuild your technical skills things like\nthat\num so yeah the learning approach was\nquite similar to University because\nquite similar\num you study the theory you watch video\ncourses and then you take an exam same\nwith University so I think the process\nlike quite similar but yeah is more\nenjoyable studying for this because I\nwas actually working towards something\nfor for that first so um for those\naren't familiar the cloud practitioner\nis uh not the entry level\num but it's the one before the associate\nlevel I don't really know I guess\npractitioner level would be the correct\nterm\nI don't in my opinion um so I've taken\nthe equivalent in Azure so that the 900\nso the fundamentals it's not easy it's\nnot simple I think a lot of people will\nI heard the opinion of like it's like a\ncertification that's not worth it\nbecause it's just entry level et cetera\net cetera but I remember taking the\nfundamentals with two years of azure\nexperience and barely passing so it's\ndefinitely not a walk in the park\num but did you find yourself like the in\nas you were studying for that\ncertification were you already like\ndeploying things in AWS where were you\ngetting Hands-On\num or was it more just like a theory\nkind of like studying\ntype for you\nyeah compared to the other\ncertifications I've done this one was a\nlot more theoretical um but the Hands-On\nthat I did was through the video courses\nso the video courses that I bought\num they had some Hands-On things that\njust even started with basic things like\nsetting up MFA and like launching um ac2\ninstance just basic things like that I\nfelt like I would like doing I could\neasily just like you know Skip the\nHands-On and things like that and\nprobably still be able to pass but the\nHands-On just helps like you know retain\nthe knowledge so much better and it\nmakes it feel like you actually learned\nsomething instead of like you memorize\nsomething so uh yeah like with that\npoint about you know like skipping\nstraight to associate certification I've\ngotten those questions as well like\nshould I skip straight to Solutions\nacting associate\num but I think if I was to go back I'll\nprobably do the same approach to\nstudying for cloud practitioner because\nin hindsight I could but it's just like\ndoing that foundational certification\nhelp build up my confidence and just\ngave me the encouragement to take a step\nfurther and like do another\ncertification whereas I might have to\nsupport like oh Solutions after\nAssociates it's too hard I don't want to\ndo this anymore so that could have been\nthe potential so I always recommend\ndoing the foundation one first I like I\nlike that approach because even if maybe\nyou don't gain the most AWS knowledge or\nCloud knowledge in general from\nfoundational certifications you are\nlearning how to study for certifications\nand it's easier if you're you're not\nlike familiar with something like that\nit's easier to do that with I guess\ncontent that is more entry level\nfriendly\num that it's not because\nit's it's another it it almost becomes\nlike uh a challenge itself to learn how\nto learn these things because being\nself-taught can be difficult and sort of\nlike the the when you set yourself up\nwith like for success and with the least\namount of obstacles and resistance\num which something like a foundational\ncertification will do for you it's it's\nlike you're building a habit of learning\nand studying which I think is fantastic\ndo you remember well the hardest part\nfor you to learn about that service\noh this is two years back let me try and\nthink\num\nhardest part might have been just\nConcepts that oh because you know like\nwith the courses they try and be like as\naccommodating and inclusive as possible\nas in like um if there's any I.T\nfundamentals that they introduce they'll\ntry and just give a summary of it\num there was some stuff that I've just\nnever come across before like I didn't\nreally know too much about the\nnetworking side of AWS like how disease\nwork and stuff and then so that I think\nsome sort of Concepts took me a while to\nlearn because I had to just take a step\nback and just yeah do a bit more you\nknow study on the I.T fundamentals\num but sometimes yeah it just depends on\nthe video course that you take and\nthings like that because sometimes the\nmore detailed courses actually help you\ncover the initial fundamentals as well\ntrue I I like that and that also Builds\non the point of you know their learning\nmaterial\num you know you mentioned you use this\ncourse you were using courses video\ncourses and I think sometimes people get\nfrustrated because they try to use\ncontent that's worked for other people\nthat may not work for them\num so that's also important something\nthat you find along your journey of\nstudying it's like oh this type of\ncontent I've learned that it doesn't\nreally work for me and maybe I can learn\nbetter with like a different kind of\napproach for me\nstudying for that Azure fundamentals the\nhardest part for me to stick was all\nlike slas because you get asked about\nlike what's the SLA for this service and\nthen you're supposed to know the\ndifference between like 99.99999 versus\nlike\n99.997 like like I don't know so that\npart for me was was\nMaybe\na little bit boring which probably made\nit harder to study for\nlearning memorizing like yeah I don't\nknow like I probably forgot that after\nlike right after I took the\ncertification I most likely forgot about\nthat one\num so after the practitioner what was\nyour next cert\nuh Solutions Arctic associate yepI went a month after sitting the\nchiropractitioner um but I think that\ntook about three weeks so like I just\ntook a week off after doing our practice\nstarted studying for it about three\nweeks there was a lot of overlap between\nthe two sets okay\nsimilar services and everything but just\nfrom the perspective of like if a\nSolutions architect were to like you\nknow um architect things on AWS like how\nthat would look like so the questions\nwere kind of around the perspective of a\nSolutions architect\nokay yeah you did three weeks for the\npractitioner one week sort of like a\nbreak and then three weeks studying for\nthe art the solution architect and did\nyou pass it on like first try\nyeah that one first try\num there was one that I failed twice I\nthink I think that was when um I first\ngot to know your channel as well because\nyou commented on that one uh it was the\nassist of certification that that's a\ntough one I've heard yeah it's pretty\ntough and I think that made it tougher\nresult it introduced like Hands-On Labs\nnow within this test\num but yeah we can talk more about that\none later\nyeah um\nyou you this I want to dive more into\nsolution architecting in a little bit\nbut let's I want to continue talking\nabout this certification Journey you you\ntake the solution architect and then\nwhat do you take after that did you take\nanother week off before the next one\noh that one I think it took a bit of a\nlonger break I think two months after I\ndid the developer associate exam okay uh\nso I think I think I took a longer break\nfor that one but that one I think\nprobably took another month of studying\nas well okay did you feel that\nbecause of that month that you took off\nthat uh you might have lost anything\nthat like or do you feel like maybe it\nwould have been more beneficial to take\nit like sooner or like how do you feel\nabout that time that you gave to\nyourself between the two\nyeah\nI definitely would have um uh had like\nbeen a memory retention and things like\nthat if I did a singer I don't think I\nneeded that break\nat the time I was doing certifications I\nwas studying full-time in uni and I was\nalso interning part-time at AWS so I\nthink I just needed a bit of a lotsociety as well so yeah\nI'm actually more free these compared to\nlike you know two years ago\nyes I I commend people who do who work\nand then go to school or go to school\nand work to any capacity because the\namount of things that you have to be on\ntop of and then also I feel like we tend\nto forget that we are also all human\nbeings that have just full\nresponsibilities of so many things\noutside of work outside of school and\nsome of us have may have more some of us\nhave may have less so to handle all of\nthat at the same time it's just it's a\nlot so I'm glad you you did give\nyourself a Break\num between those two did how did you so\nthe only AWS certification I've ever had\nwas the developer associate and that was\nthe one that I took when I was up from\nmy helpless job to into my sis admin job\nI took that one it took me six months to\nstudy for that certification\nsix months because I was they didn't\nhave the practitioners or fundamentals\nor any like associate was the I guess\nthe first level\num back then so I was like I was like so\nobsessed and back then there was did you\never use Linux Academy\ndid you ever hear Olympics Academy\nI heard of it\nwait I forgot who acquired who like yeah\na code grew acquired Linux Academy and\nthen plural plural site acquired a cloud\nGuru so I guess Linux Academy is now\npart of I don't know but I used Linux\nacademy uh and back then they were\nprobably like one of the only learning\nplatforms to to learn this type of\ncontent\num\nbut I remember they had like a couple of\ndifferent a court maybe I think they had\nlike two but they were really long and\nthen and then they had Labs at the end\nof each like the way they divided\neverything was like essentially like\nmodules like module one had like six\nvideos a lab and then you had to pass a\nlab before moving on very much like what\na club Guru is like now that kind of\nstyle but it took me six months and I\nremember like passing for that and I was\nlike\nI think studying for that\num was one of the most fun funnest\nthings that I've done in terms of like\nstudying in general because you know we\ngo to we have school middle school high\nschool I did like one year of college\nand out of all the things that I studied\nthat entire time studying for that six\nmonth certification was the most fun\nthat I've ever had so I wonder what was\nyour experience with it\num did you like it and over tell me how\ndid you how do you feel about that sir\nyeah oh wow that's a sign right it's\nlike if you really like it then you know\nyou should probably be doing something\nsimilar as a job exactly exactly so yeah\ndevelop I don't think I was super\nexcited for last time it was kind of\nlike because I've already done like uh\ntwo at that point I was like okay this\nis my third one\num a lot of overlap as well for with the\nsolutions I think Associated it was just\nfrom the perspective of someone who's a\ndeveloper um building on AWS for example\num I think that one had more like Ci CD\nand like a few other like developer\nServices as well I think that was like\nthe main difference but overall quite\nsimilar\num but yeah good experience with the set\num yeah that one didn't feel too bad\nabout pass on the first go not like okay\nyeah quite okay after that you got this\nup sys UPS one and do you do you\ndid you take a break or was it like\nimmediate into it\nI think it was immediately into it\nbut I think at that point I just kind of\ncut my I had a mindset that like I've\nalready done like the other associates\nthat's already like this one would be\nquite chill like I can probably just\nstudy a little bit and then pass it\num but then no like yeah solutions that\nlike the CIS of swan uh it does take\nmore time because yeahpeople definitely always say it's like\nthe hardest out of the three sides and\nit does need a lot more Hands-On\npractice as well to be able to answer\nthose questions because there was a lot\nof like monitoring troubleshooting\nquestions like what happens if this goes\nwrong so it's like you can only kind of\nget that experience if you've like\nactually been Hands-On and like taken\ntime to do all the labs okay um so yeah\nkind of learned it the hard way because\neven the second time I was doing it I\ndidn't do too many Hands-On labs and\nthen the final time I'm like I can't\nfeel it more than twice uh so I actually\nput in profit effort for the third time\nokay do you do you remember which one\nyou got the best score onum I'll probably just the first one like\nyeah that would make sense yeahyou're right you're right you're right\ndo you\nhave out of the four which one was\nyour your least favorite to study for\neignif you could only have taken one which\none would that be\n[Music]\num\ngood question yeah yeah\nprobably Solutions Arctic associate okay\nbecause I think that would be the one\nthat I probably could try and do without\ncloud crack knowledge and also I think\nthat's the one that's\num it's the most popular one like I\nthink that's the one that most the most\npeople have taken\num that one and then yeah because for my\nSolutions are acting role I think that\nwould have been the most helpful as well\nanyways uh but it will depend on what I\nwould what what role I would want to get\ninto as well okay after my internship so\nokay and and\nlooking back also at like the approach\nthat you took for the certifications is\nthere anything that stands out to you\nthat you think you could have done or\nchanged so it would have gone better or\njust anything you would have changed\nabout that whole processyeah I think more Hands-On\num and more hands-on experience and also\nprobably I'll tell myself not to rush it\ntoo much and just like get a set done\nevery single month I'll take my time\nbecause as I was studying for the\ncertifications of the services sometimes\nI just really wanted to just like check\nout the service in the console build\nsome things but then yeah because I had\nalready booked my exam for the month\nafter I was like okay I need to kind of\nbe smart with my time and just study\nwhat I needed to study in a way so I\nthink yeah I would have taken my time\nespecially if there was no particular\nrush in like you know doing those\ncertifications all right do you have any\ninterest in certifications outside of\nthe AWS ones to to take now\num or do you have any plans for new\nsearch that you want to take\nI'll have to look into it um but people\nhave like recommended some sales\nespecially on the I.T fundamentals I\nthink that's something I would love to\njust get strong at just learning like\nnetworking security and just I've had\nthings like you know CCNA like the\ncomptr sets\nyeah it'll be interesting\nyeah but I think so it's not the top\npriority at the moment because I think\nuh it was really quite the start to snap\nyour a learning plan but then I think\nnow I know what specific areas I want to\ndive deeper into that's that's actually\na great pivot into into sort of\nanswering some of the questions we have\nin the chat because\num I search a very popular topic uh let\nme take a look here\nuh here's a question from ar8 were you\nworking in cloud while taking the\npractitioner certification\nI was working at AWS uh but not in a\ncloud role so I don't think it really\nhelped too much it was it was cool to be\ninvolved in like the AWS culture I was\ndoing it because other people like my\ncolleagues were also studying so that\nCommunity was nice but I didn't really\nget to apply any of that during my\ninternship like the actual Cloud skills\nand everything okay awesome uh let's see\nit's here's one from Steven it's Cloud\npractitioner important or should I go\nstraight to learning Cloud solution\narchitect I think we touched a little\nbit on this but I maybe if you have just\nlike a straightforward answer for this\ngo ahead\num\nyeah we talked about this so\num star practitioner I think it's like\nboth our personal recommendation because\nwe're always recommend to start off with\nthe foundation one you know build\nconfidence and then go on to Solutions\narchitect\num but then if you feel like you can go\nstraight to it that's fine as well\num yeah if if you feel like especially\nwith people with like previous Cloud\nexperience or I.T experience going\nstraight to Solutions I think associate\num I don't see too much of a problem\nespecially if they feel like it's not\ntoo much of like a learning curve going\nstraight to that yeah yeah exactly I\nthink\num\npeople I usually recommend people to\nstop seeing certifications as something\nthat you just need to get to put on your\nresume and more so as like like a\ncomplete experience you're you're giving\nyourself a curriculum curriculum you\nhave guided learning there's so many\nresources out there that you can use to\nlearn and take your time but it's also\nan opportunity for you to discover how\nyou learn when it comes to like\ndifferent Cloud things because like you\nknow once you stop take your\ncertification you're done studying\nthat's not where the end of your\nlearning\nlike that's not where it ends like that\nis just the beginning and if you you if\nyou really yeah you you put the work\ninto really understanding how you can\nlearn new things like the next time or\nthe next couple of months if you need to\nlearn containers if you need to learn\nserverless if you need to learn\norchestration if you need to turn on say\nICD like a bunch of other things you'll\nbe able to take the foundations from\nstudying from like guided or not I guess\noutlined things and going into uh\ndifferent topics and I just I just I'm\njust a big fan of learning how to learn\ninserts are a great ways to to test that\nout and try that out and don't just do\nit for\nto share on LinkedIn in order to share\non your resume and things like that\nright uh all right let me take a look\nhere what else we got before we dive\ninto different topics\num\nso you need both developer and sysop\ncertifications for AWS devops cert or\none out of the two I don't really know\nhow AWS certifications work to be honest\nI'm pretty sure if you go to that AWS\ncertification page it'll tell you the\nprereqs right it'll outline what you\nneed to get\nI think just from memory they removed a\nlot of like the previous prereqs they\nused to have I'm not sure if that's a\nprereq though um yeah it might be good\nto double check on the site yeah the um\nthe information will be there and also\nthe one thing I've learned about\ncertifications is that uh especially\nwith the Azure ones they're always\nchanging the number the name sometimes\nchange the pre-works changed how to\nrenew the process chains so your best\nbet is always going to be just go to the\npage and see what what is like the\nlatest outlined uh there let me take a\nlook here what else do we got uh Richard\nsays definitely the sysops was the hard\nhardest of all the three Associates but\nit is fun so is this this Ops\nwhat is it more focused on like I I've\nnever looked at the the content of it um\nis it like\nI guess what would the CIS Ops\ncertification translate into a role\nbecause like you know you think\ndeveloper associate be the cloud\ndeveloper solution architect solution\narchitect what about this this apps one\npotentially sis admin\nokay yeah I guess I was thinking that I\nwas thinking like maybe Cloud admin\nsysadmin\num so I would imagine it it's probably\nlike a lot of networking\num\nis there like some security stuff in\nthere too\nsecurity monitoring troubleshooting yeah\nall of that okay almost it could\npotentially be a prereq to like devops\ntoo or like an intro or a primer to\ndevops as well uh cool so people are\nsaying like you don't need the prereq\nyou can go straight to that one awesome\nall right let me see there's a bunch of\nother questions people keep adding them\nin there we'll try to take a look at\nthem uh but yeah so anyway we're talking\nabout certifications and and now you\nfeel like\nalong did you take you that that\nall right actually you took four\ncertifications uh what cert did you land\nlike move into like the cloud role at\nAWS\nuh I think so right after um but I I had\nalready known that I was going to join\nthat role so I got the off I think back\nin September of 2020 and then that's\nwhere like I was studying for search so\nI started for my cloud practice August\nand then wrapped up with systops in\nDecember so I had already known that I\nwas going to be a Solutions architect at\nAWS I received that return offer\num but then yeah it was only until\nJanuary the next year in like January\n2021 did I start um the actual Solutions\nacting role okay okay so these were in\npreparation for that role so you were\ndoing all this to sort of kind of hit\nthe ground running and successful yeah\nbecause I was yeah that was like like\nyes\num it's quite scary just going straight\ninto that kind of role without some prep\num especially because my cohort they all\nstudy like computer science in\nUniversity and when I study information\nsystems it was a lot next\nso I just wanted to just like you know\nbrush up with the skills Cloud skills\nand everything beforehand just so I can\nyou know\ndo the role absolutely the the that\nchange from because you mentioned your\ninternship wasn't necessarily Cloud\nrelated and then going into your\nsolution architectural it was like how\ndid you how did that happen how did you\nmanage to to get you know the role from\nThe Internship yep\noh it was a pretty like kind of\ncase-by-case situation at the time\nbecause two years ago in Australia AWS\ninterns were still quite new like the\nidea of having interns and graduates was\nstill quite like you know like they just\nintroduced the program so they had\nabsolute like full-time associate\nSolutions acting roles but at the time\nthey didn't have many solutions Arctic\ninterns so they had to find interns from\nother teams who were interested and then\nthey saw that I had somewhat of a\ntechnical background so they asked if\nyou know if I were to return would I\nwant to be an associate Solutions\narchitect in that techu program or would\nI want to consider a different role\npotentially in like sales so I kind of\nwas given two choices whether to kind of\nbe a sales rep or be a Solutions Arctic\nand had a lot of conversations with like\nboth people and I think in the end\npeople were like it's easier to start\noff in a technical role and then move\ninto a non-tech role if you're\ninterested online rather than the other\nway around yeah\ninteresting\nand it's interesting how things\ntend to work out and and a lot of people\nwill say like oh it's just luck but I\nthink it's just like the fact that you\nwere like the right person with the\nright enough of the skill set to be able\nto take that opportunity to like all\nright yeah if you need like these types\nof interns I mean these interns for\nthese type of kind of new thing that's\ngoing on uh and that landed you to that\nI think I think that's awesome it's it's\nbecause oftentimes people will ask for\nlike oh what's the advice to to like\nland a role or whatever it is and it's\ntough to say that sometimes it is\nlike just things that you have no no\ncontrol over like you didn't have\ncontrol over the fact that this program\nwas somewhat new in the area that you're\nin that you're in right um I remember I\nlanded my my sis admin gig which had\nwhich is where I learned Azure\num because I had just moved from one\ncity to another city and my old job my\nhelp this job was going to be over an\nhour and a half one-way commute so both\nways over three hours with traffic and I\nwas like there's no I'm doing it I'm not\ngonna do this and then the company that\nhad the sysadmin role happened to be\ncloser to the newer city and happened to\nbe hiring at their side on the same time\nand then I I applied and it worked out\nbut if I had never moved I would have\nnever been like looking for a new role\nright yeah\nyeah I and I had no control over moving\nbecause it was like a thing with my\nparents it's like oh I had to go with as\nthey were making the move I would have\nto move to so it's like a lot of times\nit's there's things that you have no\ncontrol over that make an impact in your\ncareer too but how do you you can't\nreally quantify that or provide advice\nover that too except for like oh you\njust got to be ready for whatever\nopportunities kind of you fall into or\nfall into your lap and whatnot\num but very cool I I you you were\ntalking about projects and getting\nHands-On and where that that's more of\nyour focus now and then I think that's\nthat's very true as like as you\nspecialize you go Niche you gain more\nexperience in whatever role you're in\nyou kind of\nlike certifications kind of like take\nmaybe like the back burner\num not as important as when they are\nearly on so can you can you talk about\nlike what's like the you remember being\nlike the first Cloud project you did\num and what are some things that you\nfeel like you want to work on now or\nyou've been working on now\num\nso yeah this is probably not the very\nfirst car project but one thought was\nthat really stood out to me that helped\nme the most is probably uh because in\nAWS all solutions Architects have to go\nthrough something called the awesome\nBuilder program that's just something\nwhere there's like three sets of\npresentations you have to do the first\none is just around explaining to a\ncustomer like the AWS messaging like\nbenefits of the cloud uh why AWS and\nthings like that the second one is like\ndrawing an architecture and then doing\nlike a whiteboarding session\num and then the third one is building a\nproof of concept like a demo and then\nshowcasing that um so all three of them\nis kind of like a fictitious uh company\nand then you have like a panel of more\nSenior Solutions Architects that can\nkind of assess you and then yeah so once\nwe pass all three then we're kind of\nlike qualified to be able to actually\nspeak to customers because I was kind of\nlike done like standardized that like\nyou know you've you know the messaging\nyou know how to whiteboard and you know\nhow to build a proof of concept yeah I\nthink that one taught me the most\num you can get get to choose like\nwhatever build whatever but I chose to\nbuild like a three team web application\nyou know um hosted with like ec2 RDS and\nthen just like linked a lot of the AWS\ncore Services together and then I think\nthat was time where I could just really\nsee how companies can just really\nbenefit from AWS\num I think yeah the points before where\na lot of it was theoretical but I'll\nlike build like half of something or\nlike but that was the first time I think\nI built like a proper full application\num so yeah I think that was the most\ndefining one and I recommended that in\nmy recent video as well around yeah car\nproject beginners because I think yeah\nthat's one that I think everyone should\nstart with especially after getting\ncertifications that should be like a\ngood Next Step do you\nso I know this is a very\nlike unique question for everyone and\neveryone's going to have like you know\ntheir own answer but do you feel like\nthere's a sweet spot for certifications\nlike at what point do you feel like all\nright at this point it's time for you to\ngo in and build something or do\nsomething outside of certs like do you\nhave a number in mind\num\ndone a lot of like mentoring calls if\npeople ask me this kind of just have a\nquestion and then I always like like\nwork backwards from the job that they\nwant to become like let's say like\nAssociates architect\num if you work backwards of the job then\nyou have to think about what kind of\nresume you'll need to have or like what\nskills you need to have in the interview\nand then work backwards and then go like\nokay what certification should I get\nwhat kind of projects should I get so\nyeah it's very like Case by case and it\ndepends on like uh the like everyone\nwill give different like advice but I'll\nrecommend getting Cloud practitioner and\nthen starting your first car project and\nthen studying for the solutions Arctic\nassociate afterwards and then\num I think applying to the role you\ndon't have to apply after you've done\nall three you can do it right after\ngetting the car practitioner because\nfor the resume I just recommend if\npeople are in the middle of studying for\nit just put Solutions Arctic associate\nand put brackets like in progress and\nthen okay chances are online an\ninterview you would have you know gotten\nthe knowledge and probably the\ncertification as well so that you can do\non the interview\num so yeah so it's I think overall two\nsets Okay and then maybe one or two\npower projects and I like the advice of\nlike take one\ndo go do something else build something\nthen take the next one and then you know\nmaybe maybe even you continue building\non that additional Pro that for initial\nproject but with the new things that\nyou've learned I have a I have a\ncolleague he created this project called\nthe Azure pet store and he built it\nusing all the services that he was\nstudying for the the Azure 204 the\ndeveloper certification so there's a lot\nof like\num active directory there's like um\ncontainers there's like container apps\nuh there's like logic apps there's\nthere's like so many different things I\nhighly recommend it people go Google\nAzure pet store and he has it all\ndocumented he has individual steps of\nhow to implement it and he keeps it up\nto date and as he learns new things it's\nlike his hero project and he also uses\nthat project to uh like speak at\nconferences but also to explain he's a\nhe's a solution architect as well he\nalso uses that to explain to his\ncustomers about like certain different\nworkflows different solutions and it's\nlike a bunch of things so I just the the\nimpact that that one project and setting\nfor that one certification has has been\nlike has brought him like so much more\nand and in his career because of that\none well done project which I think have\nyou done the cloud resume challenge or\nI'm sure you've heard of it but I'm not\nsure if you've done it yeah I've come\nacross it a lot but I know there's uh I\nhaven't done it before but I know\nthere's Azure and AWS version right I\nwonder if there's like a pet store AWS\npet store then someone needs to create\nit because that sounds like creative\nyeah get it get in touch with his name\nis Chris the the author of the project\nthat would be an awesome\num yeah just like project experience for\nanyone uh the AWS gcp uh or whatnot but\nyeah there's there's\ndifferent Cloud resume projects but it's\nalso one of those projects that you\nit'll you can like always add more to or\nor try different types of things like\nonce you've built it out in one way and\nit's originally asking you to work with\nlike a serverless database and a\nserverless function but you can go and I\ndon't know replace the the serverless\nfunction with something inside of a\ncontainer or uh maybe try a different\ndatabase technology it's like a bunch of\ndifferent things that you can sort of\nmake modifications off of it but it's\nlike one hero project so I can see\nsomeone doing like you know and I think\nactually Forrest who is the original\ncreator of the cloud resume challenge he\nrecommends doing fundamental\ncertification then the cloud resume\nChallenge and then doing potentially\nanother certification after that\num so yeah and like also like maybe if\nmaybe your Niche is like Cloud security\nmaybe you put an emphasis on security\nservices in the types of projects or no\nthere's like a lot of potential out\nthere so anyway\ncoming back to to your sort of like your\nLearning Journey\nwhat are sort of like some resources\nthat you've used that you that you\nrecommend for the people to check out uh\nthis could be free this could be paid\nany type of resource really\nyep I could do some shout outs um the\nones that just taught me a lot um but I\njust want to mention as well like I\nthink same with you when you were doing\nthe certifications a couple years ago\nand you know when I did my\ncertifications two years ago there\nweren't as many\num I think free roast resources and\nthings have like changed a lot since\nthen\num because like first one I would\ndefinitely recommend to people now is\nlike especially for AWS courses\num is AWS skill Builder back then they\nwere just starting out with it there\nwere too many courses but AWS now they\neven have like Hands-On labs they give\nyou like a Sandbox environment where you\ncan do tutorials and things and they\nhave like a six hour free course for a\ncar practitioner\num so I'll recommend AWS skill Builder\nas just like the free resource for\neveryone to use\num the ones that have personally helped\nme is tutorials dojo for practice exams\num Neil Davis the fan Merrick I don't I\ndon't even know if people would be like\njoining this stuff but you know like I\nhave them in my videos I have like yeah\nyou know certification videos and I talk\nabout each of them\num but yeah the ones I I tend to like\nare the ones that are just really\nconcise and then have a lot of Hands-On\nVibes as well as well okay awesome I I'm\nnot an AWS person but I've heard Stefan\nMerrick and uh what is this Adrian yeah\nthose two names I feel are just like\nStaples when it comes to learning at AWS\nI've even like again I've I've not\ntouched anything AWS in\nlet me see maybe oh no when I worked at\na cloud Guru never mind so that was just\ntwo years ago\num or like a year and a half ago or\nsomething like that but uh yeah those\nare just names that I feel like I hear\nthem every single week people recommend\nthose so I'm sure I'm sure it's a great\ngreat quality and whatnot so do you find\nyourself\nusing\num\nlike documentation a lot too\nfor me or you mean like studying for\ncertifications or just in general yeah\nand and when it comes to like trying to\nbuild something\noh yeah for sure yeah documentation uh\nbecause a lot of the courses\num even when they're just like tailored\ntowards building things you would need\nto just write the documentation because\nsometimes like things aren't updated or\nlike sometimes you want to make a trick\nto your projects and things like that\ndocumentation definitely helps and\ndefinitely as a Solutions architect back\nthen as well like it that was I just\nalways had to rely on like documentation\nbecause that just had the most\nup-to-date information as well for\ncustomers for My Cloud Learning Journey\nnot so much I relied a lot on video\ncourses but yes we both mentioned it\njust\nI think take all this advice like you\nknow for everyone watching take all this\nadvice with a gram of salt because yeah\nsome people that I've talked to they\nreally like ebooks and then they really\nlike just ready documentation white\npapers for their study\num like sometimes people just can't take\nin information if they're just like you\nknow listening it to work passively so\nyeah definitely figure out which one is\nright for you like what's kind of study\nresource uh absolutely I whenever I tell\npeople this they always get surprised\nbut I cannot learn something watching\nvideos it does does it work I can't I I\nbut I think it's also because in my\nday-to-day I don't really watch a lot of\nvideo like I don't I'm not really one to\nlike watch Netflix or things like that\num or like consume video content but I I\nhave to read because like I'll read a\nsentence and I'll have to like read it\nlike multiple times before I can fully\nunderstand what's going on and with\nvideo I find\ntrying to have that is difficult because\nthen you kind of like rewind rewind and\nit's just like not as straightforward as\nlike readings something over and over\nagain\num so that's probably why it doesn't\nwork for me but but I remember at the\nbeginning I was getting so frustrated\nbecause I remember Kali had recommended\na course and he's like check this out\nyou're gonna learn it was on um\nthere's this web technology called\nBlazer which is to to create web\napplications with net and he he was like\na senior software engineer like 25 plus\nyears developing in in.net and he's like\nwatch this course it's fantastic like\nyou'll learn like the basics and then\nwhen I hand over this project like\nyou'll understand how to take it over\nand I could not I just could not take it\nI was getting extremely frustrated and\nthen a boss of mine in that same role\nlike said like why don't you try like\nreading something out like I don't know\ntry something else maybe it's not it's\nnot you\nand then once I did it's like was so\nmuch easier for me to like intake that\ninformation but\nthese are the sort of lessons that you\nlearn as you go as well um but big fan\nof reading reading documentation\num and it now has more become sort of\nlike the first place that I go to uh\nbecause a lot of people put in there's\nentire teams dedicated to building\nproper documentation uh and you know no\none really knows a product more in and\nout than\nlike that well I mean it's supposed to\nbe the actual services that provide the\ncertain like the companies that create\nthe services\nshould have the best documentation it's\noftentimes not oftentimes but sometimes\nthey don't so maybe it's not the best\nbut I feel like it should become like a\nlike maybe a first step for most people\nlike hey just check that out first and\nthen kind of supplement with other\nthings or supplement your courses with\ndocumentations because when you're in\nlike actually working\nit's going to be a requirement you want\nto be a requirement for sure uh there's\nsome questions herebecause a lot of people kind of look at\nour videos as like a guide and then I\ndon't think I've mentioned documentation\ntoo much but then I could be like you\nknow if you if you prefer reading or\nlike just understanding through like\nwhat like yeah reading something then\nmaybe check out this resource instead\nyeah because everything I think it's all\nbeen video\nyeah I I ca I can't which is funny\nbecause I make like weekly videos so\npeople are like but like like that\ndoesn't make sense I'm like I don't know\nit just it works it works that way for\nme\num\nPoint them to the documentation yeah\nyeah absolutely absolutely\num all right let's take a look here uh\nlet me see what do we got I'm currently\nin high school and very interested in\ncloud computing do I need experience to\ntake certifications is there do you know\nif there's an age like a age do you have\nto be to take a certification I don't\nknow like you don't have to be\nI've seen on 18 like 14 years yeah like\n14 year olds I think they're taking\ncertifications there might be some\nguidance that you need like I'm just\nrandomly guessing but like some sort of\napproval a parental approval Guardian\napproval or something like that to take\nthe exam I'm not so sure but\num we have AWS Academy and AWS educate\nwhich is programs and like self-paced\nthings just for high school students\nthat might be something to check out\nI would also recommend\num like the student programs like for\nexample we have the student ambassador\nprogram and\nand the Google has the campus experts\nI can't remember but there's a lot of\nmost large tech companies have\nAmbassador Ambassador programs that are\nspecific for students that I highly take\nit like highly well we both highly\nrecommend you you look into because\nyou get like resources sometimes you get\ncredit sometimes you get like mentorship\nwith people who work at the company swag\na bunch of cool things like that\num but yeah you don't you don't really\nneed experience like like like Lucy\nmentioned like your first certification\nwas sort of just I want to learn some\ncloud and\nlet's take the practitioner that's why I\nlove the practitioner level\ncertifications it's like it just opens\nthe opportunity for really anyone like\nyou don't immediately have to go to\nassociate level like you can you can\ntake a step back and start at the\npractitioner level which is fantastic\nand then you get people who maybe would\nhave never done it\num and you're like enabling them to to\nstudy for cloud and those so I think\nit's awesome wait here's the Canadian\nages 13 to 17 are permitted to take AWS\ncertification exams with the consent of\ntheir parent or legal guarding okay so\nyou're spot on there with having needing\npermission also you'll probably need\nlike a credit card which maybe some\nstudents don't have so that might be\nsomething else that you need to consider\nyeah uh here we have another one\nany advice on a scrum Master agile coach\nwanting to Pivot into your field any\nfree search courses skills Etc so this\nopens up another\nquestion that I wanted to ask you\num mainly because this person said like\npivot into your field well just because\nwe're both in Cloud doesn't really mean\nthat we do like the same thing or or\nlike our upscaling or what we spend our\ntime like working on or working towards\nday to day is going to be the same so do\nyou want to talk a little bit about what\nthe solution architect\nrole is like what would your day-to-day\nand just just quickly answer this person\nI would say before you try to Pivot into\nthe field have like a really good idea\nwhat role you want to do and once you\nhave that role sort of reverse engineer\nlike Lucy was saying like go find like a\njust like a role description that\nmatches the role you want to do get get\nthe description and kind of use that as\nlike a study guide and then you'll find\nlike what you need to upskill in but\nyeah do you want to talk a little bit\nmore about what a solution architect\ndoes at AWS\num and what your day-to-day kind of\nlooked like\nyeah uh so Solutions Arctic I'll just\ngive my channel a pitch so we like to\ncall them at like you know trusted\ntechnical advisors for customers as they\ngo along their Journey reducing the\ncloud so that's what we call like how we\nDefine Solutions how we Define Solutions\nArchitects are AWS\num what we do day-to-day really varies\nand depends on yeah there's a lot of\nthings and like the customers that you\nwork with but generally I could be\nspending my time talking to customers to\nunderstand like the situation on like\nwhat they'd like to build on AWS\num what their Technical and business\nrequirements are and then after getting\nthose requirements I can then go back\nand map out a solution for them so that\nsolution could be like an architectural\ndiagram it could be approval concept\nlet's just show them what it's actually\ngoing to be like and then\num once they're happy to move on to the\ncloud and just like happy to go forward\nwith using the service I would then\neither direct them to the AWS\nProfessional Services team who do the\nimplementation or introduce them to our\npartner or Partners so AWS has like a\nlarge partner network with companies\nlike you know Deloitte essential iTalk\nthere's quite a few so depending on the\nscale of the like you know\nimplementation or like what they want to\nbuild and then I'll then work with you\nknow the sales team to find out like\nwhat the next step is\num but Solutions Architects are quite\ninvolved more in the early stages before\ncustomers actually like want to actually\nImplement and build it so you know we\ndon't really necessarily code like\nthings out for the customer\num we don't do things like you know\nsuper detailed like troubleshooting for\nthem it's more like mapping out a\nsolution for them\num I think there's things I'm missing\nabout the solutions that I think well\nthere's just so much to cover about the\nrole I I would also say and you and I\nwere talking a little bit about this the\nother day that a solution architect at\ndifferent companies will look\ndifferently so if people are targeting\nthe role\num it's not sort of like this Universal\nor generic sort of study guide or\nperhaps like even like a solution\narchitect uh certification wouldn't\nprepare you for a social architect role\nat every single company because we\nbecause you were you and I were talking\nabout how\num\nlike I\nmy potential next role would be a\nsolution architect and then you were\nsaying you were asking me like oh do you\nstill feel like that would be your your\nthing and I was sort of giving me giving\nmy my Outlook on it\num but then that's when you and I\ndiscovered like all social architect at\nMicrosoft uh can potentially be\ndifferent than like a solution architect\nat AWS even at that scale so we have and\nthen there's solution Architects that\nare at Microsoft that are sort of early\nfocusing on the that early phase uh very\nsimilar to what you were mentioning and\nthen there are ones that are focused on\nimplementing and then I think you were\nsaying that those are more like Cloud\nArchitects at AWS\nyeah I've done a bit of thinking like\njust over the past few months I've\nrealized that I think Azure specialist\nis kind of like our Cloud Solutions\nArchitects at AWS which is gcp's\ncustomer Engineers\num that's like the correlation and then\nlike AWS Cloud Architects are Azure\nSolutions Architects I think and then\nwho has like their Professional Services\nConsultants as well so yeah like the\nbest way to just go about it is just to\nlike not really look at the role but\njust the job description and have a look\nat what\nis then you can see like what role that\nactually is yeah I also tell people who\nare wanting to get into Cloud don't\nfocus on the fact that if cloud is in\nthe role or not in like the title like\nthat really doesn't matter as you grow\nyou spend more time you specialize your\nNiche like your your role will become\nmore and more specific of course but\nlike 2022 tons of like um I've even seen\nhelped us grow sis admin roles\nnetworking roles uh sock analyst roles\nthat have exposure to cloud and you\nmight be missing out on opportunities uh\nbecause you're just so focused on it\nhaving like clout in the role itself\num so yeah like don't don't don't limit\nyourself\num it's like there's so much out there\nand it could potentially also be\nlike progression like maybe you don't\nimmediately go into like a cloud\nengineer role but you start at like sys\nadmin but you get a solid foundation in\nsysadmin and then you take those skills\nand you move into\nuh like like a cloud role after that\nlike with you know a good foundation and\nyou've got like your year and it's also\neasier to move up or move into having\nlike some sort of experience before\nwhich is why I say like if you have like\none year of any type of of experience\nit's always going to be better than\nhaving nothing uh for people who are\ntrying to get into the field do you have\nany other advice we're coming up here on\nthe hour and I want to answer as many\nquestions as we can but so do you have\nany other like advice for people trying\nto get into to the space I mean you have\ntons of videos that's probably the best\nadvice people go watch Lucy's Channel\nthere's so much good content out there\nyou've talked about certifications\nprojects oh here's a good one\nskills outside of technical skills you\nfeel people like should work on\nthe land role that's actually a new\nvideo coming up um\nyeah because everyone's always like you\nknow what I.T fundamentals should I\nstudy what areas of clouds I need to\nknow uh but yeah I could talk about it\nmore specifically with Solutions arctics\nlike Studio because it is a customer\nfacing role which means that you need to\nhave customer facing uh skills\nessentially like things like being able\nto listen to customer requirements is\njust really understand what the\ncustomers are asking and what their\nrequirements are less so than just\npitching them a solution based off of\nlike your assumptions\num there's things like having empathy as\nwell just knowing like like when talking\nto a customer\num I think stakeholder management as\nwell just not because you won't just be\nworking with customers you'll also be\nworking with the sales teams but\ndifferent people within the organization\nlike other Solutions Architects there's\njust a whole bunch of those\ninterpersonal and soft skills are quite\nimportant to develop as well\num aside from those technical skills one\nthing I want to mention this actually I\nhaven't covered it in a video yet but I\nthink it's just something yeah that\nwould be good to talk about is that like\nthere are different Pathways into\nbecoming a Solutions architect\nespecially like these things because\num I think one way a way that like a lot\nof people know about is you know\nstarting off with let's say like help\ndesk this admin you know Cloud engineer\nand then Solutions Arctic but I think\nthe industry has really changed a lot\nover the past couple of years in that\nlike especially in the past two years\nthey've introduced AWS themselves and I\nthink other companies will have\nintroduced the more associate level\nroles and submissions Arctic internships\nas well and that's just really like I\nthink it's just been like a big industry\nshift because in the past like\nsubmissions Arctic so people with like\nmany years of experience in it as a\nsoftware developer as a consultant and\nthen they want to kind of like take all\nthose years of learning to become a\nSolutions architect right whereas a lot\nof people you know straight out of\nUniversity or like you know straight off\nlike maybe studying like in a boot camp\nor potentially just like self-taught\nlike you know studying for\ncertifications they can go straight into\nthis sort of role so I think just\ngetting people to just keeping the\noptions open is that like there are\nmultiple Pathways you can take now and\nthen that you can actually start up your\ncareer as an associate Solutions\narchitect\nawesome yeah there's no like one\ntemplate that you have to follow and\nalso the way that once someone went into\nit doesn't necessarily mean it will work\nor won't work for you but then that's\nalso the beauty of it and and that\nshould enable you to not feel frustrated\nif something isn't like working for you\nlike maybe it might be your role your\njourney is going to be completely\ndifferent and then you can later go on\nand document and help someone else with\nlike your own uh yeah there's like\nthere's so many different ways to to get\ninto space I want to answer a few\nquestions just before we we tap out here\num you said boot camp someone did ask\nopinions on boot camps uh what are your\nviews on cloud boot camps have you done\na video on this or is this topic that\nyou well you have an opinion on\nI want to do a video on it\num but then I think I would need to do\nmore research because like I haven't you\nknow I haven't done a vocab myself and I\nhaven't looked too much into it but\nrecently I've been talking with a few\nstudents who have done a boot camp and\nthey felt like you know they felt like\nit was really helpful for them but then\nI kind of want to compare that to like\nyou know that experience with like\nversus if they were to do a\ncertification themselves like just\nbreaking down the things like the cost\nthat added benefit there's a whole bunch\nof factors the community aspects because\nI know there's pros and cons of each uh\nbut yeah I've got to do more research\ninto it and I think I want to do things\nwhere I can like maybe conduct like a\nlike a quick interview with like people\nwho have been through some of those boot\ncamps and see like maybe there are ones\nthat you know like they do have like a\nlower cost but they offer like the same\namount of value as like maybe like a ten\nthousand dollar boot camp so yeah yeah a\nlot of things out there but it's hard to\ngive any advice right now what about you\nI think yeahI I have this reputation of going off\nfrom rants on Stream So and I've done a\nfew on boot camps\num but I've also done a fair amount of\nresearch because when I was sort of\ngetting wanting to get into the space\num so back\n27 16 2017 uh boot camps was one of the\noptions that people were telling me\nabout and then I kept like like reading\nlike first of all a lot of them don't\nhave\nlike results like just like a lot of\ntestimonials and things like that so\nthat was kind of like shady to me\num but so then I went like the\nself-taught route because I was like I'm\nnot I think the one I was looking at was\nlike 27 000 and I was broke when I tell\nyou that I had like I had like a\nnegative 200 in my bank account there's\nno way I could afford this and I also\nhave didn't have like great credit which\ncredit is very important concept here in\nthe US\num\nyou know that's a whole different type\nof live stream\num but I didn't I could I just couldn't\nafford it so I went to self-taught route\nand then like now I continue to look at\nboot camps because it's like something\nthat people ask me questions about and I\nstill feel like if you you think of like\na six-month duration I really do feel\nlike if people put in the time to fully\nunderstand how they learn best that they\nmost likely can teach themselves what a\nboot camp will teach them because a lot\nof people get out of the boot camps\nstill needing to put in several months\nof just upskilling on how to interview\non how to speak to your own skill set on\nuh building like credible projects\nhaving well-documented projects\num just like a bunch of things that you\nneed for like land interviews tailoring\nyour resume tailoring your couple little\nthat some boot camps do cover some boot\ncamps don't so I just feel overall it's\nlike very hit or miss with that being\nsaid it's still something that people\nshould research and people should look\ninto for themselves because I do\nunderstand the structure of camp like\nthe guided learning is sometimes\nsomething that people need or like\nprefer so that's you know that's up to\nthem but I just personally think that\neveryone is capable of learning on their\nown\num and I don't know I just it's like a\nlot of money it's just a lot of money\num\nFork out the money now like it just\ndoesn't seem worth it right like let\nalone as a student like 27k for like a\nboot camp that is a lot um yes that's\nlike a brand new car that is no that is\nthe down payment on a house\n[Laughter]\num oh here's all right here I feel like\nthis is probably the best question to\nend this on but what is your second\nfavorite Cloud role and why besides\narchitect\noh yeah this is something we were\ntalking about I was like my dream role\nwas always to go back into the tech\nindustry we'll probably be what you're\ndoing now develop an advocate role or\nlike Cloud Advocate uh I just I never\nknew this role existed when I first\nstarted out like even at AWS and it just\nseems pretty cool in that like you get\nto make videos get to speak at events\nI'm sure there's you know there's a lot\nof other things that are part of the\nrole\num but yeah like from what you've seen\nas well like I think just you just get\nto spend a larger percentage of time\ndoing this kind of fun stuff so I think\nthat'll be yeah quite a cool role to try\nout um but yeah probably I would like to\nlike if I was to go back and take it I\nshould probably work overseas as well\num like Australia I just think that\nsometimes a text saying is just not as\nfast-paced\nit's all the Summers and everything\nhappen in the US and then I want to be\nwhere the cool stuff is do you have like\na a Dream City you would want to work\nout of\nOh either New York or SF like you got a\ncompany when if you got to come to New\nYork\nI'll show you around all the good spots\nall the good food\num oh that'll be good yeah\nwe do like an in-person live stream next\ntime yeah absolutely or maybe we'll do a\nmeet up or something like that\nall right\num Lucy thank you so much for hanging\nout I got to have you on hopefully maybe\nthe next time it'll be in person somehow\num but this was awesome uh very very\nhappy that we have people like you in\nthe space that are educating uh just\nlike you're such a nice person I think\nthat is so important like people take\nthat for granted but it is so important\nto have a nice person to look to look up\nto and I think that's very important\num yeah it's just also just\nrepresentation you know you being uh\nsuch a like a strong figure in the cloud\nspace like uh you know you're a woman\nlike I just this is like so many awesome\nthings about you and I'm just so proud\nof you as well\nand so is everyone in that everyone in\nthe chat\nyeah I realized I haven't been looking\nat the comments right but I was like\nquite a few people were asking questions\nlike being supportive so yeah hopefully\nwe'll get to do this again and yeah\num absolutely all right yeah\nI thought it was like 20 minutes\nall right I'm gonna say bye to everyone\nin the chat and I will see you I don't\nknow if I'm gonna stream next Sunday\num I got a lot going on I gotta work on\na course but anyway see y'all",
