  "transcript": "today i wanted to talk to you about the\ncertification that had the most impact\non my career\nwhich might be interesting to know that\nit's not actually a cloud one and it's\nnot actually the first one that i took\nsee the first certification i took was\nthe\naws certified developer associate and\nthis was when i was in my help desk gig\nbefore moving into my sys admin gig\ni spent six months\nstudying for that and i actually\nrecently found my notes\nlike the pdf that i have on the notes\nthat i took for that certification\nand i was sort of surprised to realize\nthat it was 61 pages long it's on learn\nto cloud if you go to phase 3 resources\nyou can find them there but\nyeah i learned a lot from there but\nit didn't necessarily turn into like the\nmost impactful or the one that i learned\nthe most from\nbecause i went from setting that\ncertification and moving into a gig that\nused azure\nso it did help my resume it did help me\nsort of do well in my interview and i\ndid learn a lot of core concepts\ncore like cloud concepts i didn't really\nput into practice any of the aws\nspecific things right\nfast forward to\ni think it was the beginning of last\nyear where i took my linux essentials\ncertification\nand to this day the things that i've\nlearned in that cert\nis are things that i use\ni can\nconfidently say\nalmost on the daily\nand what do i mean by this\nlike the\ni've always known that understanding how\nto use commands a command line\nand\na cli and things like that\nhave been very important\ni just never learned it in the order\nthat i would recommend beginners learn\nit now like i tell\ni tell everyone to sort of put becoming\ncomfortable with a command line at the\nbeginning of their journey into cloud\nnow\nand that didn't happen for me until like\nthe beginning of last year which is like\na few years into my journey\nnow you know\njust today i was working with learning\nbicep which is an infrastructure s code\ntool with azure\nand i realize that i'm doing all these\nthings in the terminal i'm comfortable\nusing grab i'm\ncomfortably doing\nlike creating pipelines and redirection\nall these things and that's only because\ni took my linux essentials and i spent a\nmonth studying\nmaking like blog posts on every single\ncommand practicing all these kinds of\nthings\nand i learned it really inside out i did\nvery very well on that certification\nand it was so rewarding so much fun it\nwas just a month dedicated to learning\nlike really really learning the command\nline\ndifferent commands and such and to this\nday i use it\nso i highly recommend you study for\nit you don't necessarily have to take it\num okay you don't necessarily have to\nstudy for that specific certification\nbut i think the commands that you are\nrequired to know about for that\ncertification are absolute essentials\nand that is my quick cloud tip of the\nday\nunderstand the power of the command line\nand it's going to change\nyour your skill set and your technical\nability\nand for the better for the rest of your\njourney here in cloud\nall right\nmaybe i'll do another quick video\ntomorrow i don't know but i will see you\nin the next one",
