  "transcript": "what's going on everybody so i was just\nremembering this\nstory so i figured why not share it with\nall of you so if i could prevent\nthis from happening to any of you i'm\ntotally down for that so anyway\ni was a junior cloud engineer and i was\njust assigned my first task where i was\nactually going\nto own the solution end to end up until\nthen i was used to working with\nyou know other engineers and working on\nprojects that were led by\nyou know led by them obviously they had\nmore experience and more knowledge\nthan me so i would just work on pieces\nof their projects but i didn't have to\nmake any\ndecisions necessarily on architecture or\nwhich service to use or anything like\nthat\nso i'm assigned my first task and i'm\nexcited of course\nand since i was new i was given a little\nbit more time to actually research\nstuff so i remember sitting down with a\nlist of services that i wanted to try\nout\nand i log into my azure portal to my dev\ntest subscription\nand i didn't set up budget or billing\nalerts on\nthe subscription beginner's mistake uh\nhonestly this whole thing was\npreventable if i actually had done that\nbut i did so anyway\ni remember playing around with azure\nservice bus which if you're not familiar\nit's a messaging service\nin azure and it's quite expensive um\ni mean at least it was back then um but\nanyway yeah i played around with it for\nlike an hour or two\nand then i you know logged off and a\ncouple of days go by maybe a week i\ncan't remember exactly the timeline\nand i get an email from my boss and it's\nsomething like hey there's this charge\non our invoice that i don't recognize\ncan you log into cost management and\ntake a look\nget more details and i'm like sure i\ndidn't think much of it i really didn't\nthink it was going to be my fault really\nso anyway i realized that that charge is\nassociated with my dev test\nthe subscription so i get more details\nand i realize that it's that's\nthat uh resource that azure service bus\nresource that i never erased\ntypically i'm careful even from the\nbeginning i've always been careful with\nlike removing resources when i don't use\nthem\nnowadays every cloud tutorial that you\nlook at there's always a disclaimer\nthere that tells you hey\ni'd like at the bottom like hey remove\nthis resource when you're done\ni just didn't so i emailed my boss right\naway\nhey i'm so sorry take full\nresponsibility feel free to deduct the\ncharge from my salary or whatever\num and then you know send the email and\nthen from the time i get a response\nuh i it was probably like a couple\nminutes but it felt like an eternity to\nme\nand i was thinking like man i'm gonna\nget fired how could i do this such a\nsilly mistake\num you know i just got promoted like you\nknow all that kind of stuff so\nuh my boss pretty much was like hey\ndon't worry about it just go implement\nbilling alerts and budgets\nuh in your subscription and you know\nbeginner's mistake that's pretty much it\nuh so shout out to that boss\nfor turning this mistake into a learning\nexperience\nuh thumbs up for that uh but yeah again\nsuper silly mistake easy to prevent uh\nand if you are all getting started with\nprojects or learning cloud\ni highly recommend to take just some\ntime to look into\ncost management and whatever cloud\nplatform that you're using right\nso yeah anyway uh don't forget we have\nthe az900 live stream\ncome hang out learn about azure study\nwith us i'll make sure to leave that\nlink\nin the description also i'm doing\nan azure study hour every friday for the\nnext month\non twitter on the icloud guru twitter so\nyou can come and ask me anything related\nto azure i will have time to sit down\nand answer all of your questions\nuh so that's gonna be a fantastic time i\ncan't wait to read all those tweets\nand that's pretty much it if you enjoy\nthese kind of like short stories about\nexperiences that i've had in my cloud\ncareer\nlet me know i'd love to share more and\nyeah\nif you want to talk cloud hit me up on\ntwitter at made by gps\ni will see you in the next videoyou",
