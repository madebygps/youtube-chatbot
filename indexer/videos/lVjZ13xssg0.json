  "transcript": "coaching this is Darius and the one\npokes me for today oh you do on the\nweekend too yes\nall right hold on I think we're actually\nleft we might be live like us up live\njust\nlet me take a look which is fine so I\ndon't really like to make things yeah we\ngotta be live like us up all right so we\ngot the chat open and all right you're\nin the chat ready oh look at you what a\nprofessional\nall right uh yeah so we're well before\nwe dive too much into like questions and\nwhatnot\num we could just kind of like hang out\nintroduce\ntake some time to introduce yourself\nbecause I know I've been knowing about\nucab for a while but I don't think we've\never spoken like one on one\num\nthis is also an opportunity for me to\njust to talk to you a little bit more\nand then the cool thing is like you were\nlike you're telling me that you're\nEcuadorian which is crazy because I\ndidn't know that and I'm also equator\nfor those who don't know\num so Ecuadorian we live we both are in\nNew York we both are in Tech uh\nkind of like similar role similar\nbackgrounds and now we're on this this\nconversation kind of\nuh talking to one not but yeah thanks\nthanks for taking the time I know you're\na super busy guy\num yeah thank you but\nyeah tell us tell the people a little\nbit about you for those I'm sure a lot\nof people are familiar with you but for\nthose who aren't give yourself a little\nintro yeah definitely so um my name is\nKevin you call me Kevin foreign\non YouTube I am a um like my whole\nbackground is crazy because I I don't\ncome from a traditional background you\nknow how some people they do like WGU or\nthey go to college or they do all the\nother things yeah yeah exactly exactly I\ndon't do that so my background's a\nlittle strange because I come from 12\nYears of restaurant experience I have a\n12 years of restaurant experience okay I\nI um I went to a technical training\nschool which is actually in Brooklyn and\nthey do the CompTIA a plus stuff so I\ndid a plus training in there\num I also did four years in the NYPD so\nI have worked for their NYPD for four\nyears in Brooklyn yeah Brooklyn area\nWilliamsburg area\num uh this is my background's a little\nstrange so I did the dead restaurant I\ndid it NYPD\num then I wanted to get into it because\nI was always good with computers I just\ndidn't know how to get started in it\nbecause I just didn't know anything\nabout it and\num I was a little frustrated also show a\nlittle frustrated because I got a lot of\na lot of a lot of bad information like\noh we'll get that sir you should be good\nafter that you can get a job after that\nwhich is not true yeah\num so I went to school I got my A-Plus\nlearned about the basics the\nfundamentals of I.T\num and um that's how I got started nit\nand then lo and behold I had I had one\nof the hiring managers they came to the\nschool and they interviewed me and I was\nalso fixing computers for that school\nwhile I was being well I was doing date\nplus there and then uh going fast\nforward I now worked for a fintech\ncompany as senior desktop support and I\nwork a lot with Executives and sea level\nfolks I have a lot of a lot of executive\nexperience like I work I worked in a lot\nof hedge funds and um yeah that's that's\npretty much it about me I mean a little\nabout the YouTube stuff all over the\nplace yeah you do you do a lot man and I\nthink you also I mean you teach you\ndon't teach just on YouTube like you\nhave sort of other like I know you do\ncourses too uh do you do any like uh\nI guess physical School kind of stuff\nteaching\nvirtual okay but like yeah for like\ncollege institutions or anything like\nthat I guess more traditional\ninstitutions because like YouTube is a\nway of teaching but I don't consider it\na traditional institution\num but I know like day days like a\nassistant at like a community college I\nknow like my friend rishab does like\nsome Community College stuff too I don't\nknow if you have any of that but I know\nyou're just you kind of do like a whole\nbunch of things but the first thing I\nwant to ask you I'm probably going to be\nall over all over the place with\nquestions but I'll talk to you about a\nplus man because you and I I think have\ndifferent opinions on on a plus\nI I don't have I don't hold a plus so I\nshould probably start by there\nand I know you do and I know you talk\nabout it uh and I know you have sort of\nlike\na soft spot for it but talk to me a\nlittle bit about like the importance of\na plus for your career and\nhow you speak about that certification\nfor other people who are trying to get\ninto Tech yeah so when uh I have a love\nand hate relationship with CompTIA\nbecause you're aware yeah yeah um the\nreason why is because I'm extremely\nbiased I'm right in the middle when it\ncomes to a plus because you may need it\nor you may not need it it really depends\non the company but it depends on the job\nyou're applying for because I I have\ntrained I have done training in\nAustralia I have done training in the\nUnited States with a lot of students and\nit really depends on on the job itself\nand I have worked with a lot of people\nso some people got jobs without having\nthe a plus just having home Labs some\npeople got jobs because they have a good\nLinkedIn profile some people got jobs\nbecause they just got a reference they\njust knew somebody so it's like I'm like\nvery in the middle I'm not gonna be I'm\ngonna be like oh go get that sir you\nknow because it doesn't work that way\nbecause at the end of the day I've seen\npeople get jobs without having a search\nso it's just like so hard for me to\nanswer that question because I know some\npeople benefit from from uh having the a\nplus because some companies will will\nrequire it there's a requirement for\nthat it's just like you gotta have it or\nyou can't work here kind of deal yeah\nsome companies are like that even\nSecurity Plus for example is for\ngovernment jobs you need to have it so\nit's just really it really depends on\nthe company I'm extremely biased like I\nsaid I'm straight up in the middle but\nfor for the for the a plus stuff uh if\nyou're brand new I always recommend\nreading it because if you know nothing\nabout computers like like I did when I\ncome from I come from fast food right so\nI would always recommend reading the\nbook even if you don't even get to start\nlike read a book like you're gonna get\nyou the fundamentals right you'll be\nwell-rounded so I'd rather you be\nwell-rounded and you go and get another\nposition that's like mid-level or senior\nlevel and then you'll understand what\nthe hell you're doing and you should\nstart breaking things so that's my\nopinion on that so if let's say your job\ndoesn't require like the job you want to\ngo for doesn't require it\num do you feel like there's other people\nin like besides people who have like no\nI.T background do you feel like there's\nanyone else who you think who should go\nfor that certification\nI I for the for the eight like I said\nfor the a plus it's just like I'm always\ngonna be in the middle because you may\nnot eat or you may you may need it or\nmay not need like I said I have a love\nand hate relationship with with comptio\nyeah I was supposed to go to Chicago\nactually to speak over there but they uh\nthey they like me they don't like me so\ndo you keep it real no I think that\nmight be a good sign though I feel like\nit's tough also because it's kind of\nexpensive isn't it yes it's very\nexpensive yeah for for\nwell I mean I know it covers like a lot\nI remember buying an A plus book it was\nlike like super thick it had must have\nbeen like over 500 600 pages and I never\ntook it um\nbut I was just like wow like this is\nthere's just like so much in there but\nit certifications like that I think\ncompti in general like it's kind of more\nexpensive than like the certs that I'm\nmore familiar with are the cloud ones\nand like if you think like an\nintroductory Cloud sir it's like 99\nwhich is not it's not cheap but it's\nit's less expensive than like these\ncomptio ones\num there might be like potentially a\nlittle bit more\nuh\nuh like it's like better and honestly\nbetter on a resume but maybe it sticks\nout a little bit more than the a plus\nbut uh yeah I've always had like just\nsuch an interest on like that the A Plus\nnetwork plus and Security Plus because\neveryone calls that that like that\nTrifecta yeah um and I never really\nunderstood that but I I we can get more\ninto certain a little bit later and then\npeople please feel free to ask us\nquestions in the chat because I know\ncertifications are just like\nit's a top tough conversation to have uh\nbecause there's no right or wrong answer\nbut\num\nI also feel like you you do this well\nlike I think you take the responsibility\nof having a platform with like with\nrespect because I'll never see like\nI don't think I've ever seen videos that\nyou've done where you're like oh you get\nthis certain you're gonna get six\nfigures but I did see a post you did the\nother day where you were like I'm just\ntired about these people telling you\nthat you can do like you can get just\nthis thing and in three months you'll be\nsix figures uh because I've had that\nlike same kind of frustration lately too\nbut so just wondering\num do you do you feel like lately if\nyou've come across people who think like\noh they just gotta do oh maybe they've\nbeen told like oh do I just got to do\nthis and then I'm I'm into Tech like I'm\nmaking those six figures\nyeah I get I get frustrated because I\nI've been in I.T for a while now and\nthere's a lot of like catch like quick\nschemes there's a lot of like fake\npeople out there and I try to I tell\npeople to try to avoid them because I\nhave done I have worked with someone\nthat he took a he did a uh like a boot\ncamp\num and he paid twenty thousand dollars\nfor it he couldn't he couldn't get a job\nafter that yeah and then he he did what\nI told him to do and he got a job\nafterwards yeah and he didn't pay\nanything well he just went on my YouTube\nchannel and that says I should have\ntaken your advice and then paid the\ntwenty thousand dollars doesn't make any\nsense like just doesn't make any sense I\nfeel like the getting into Tech\nlike that framework that you you and I\nsort of have like gone through and I\nsort of is what I continue to encourage\nis you know get yourself like a support\nrole very entry level friendly\num and then kind of grind that out for a\nyear year and a half which I believe is\nmore than enough for you to go and kind\nof figure out what you want to do next\nand go like apply and whatnot and then\nkind of just move up the ladder now as\nyou move up the ladder you can become\nmore Niche and you know specialize and\nwhatnot but you got to start somewhere\nand I think that's something that\nanybody who wants to could could do\nreally like because that can you know\nobviously you're gonna have to continue\nworking your entire career towards like\nwhere you really want to go to but that\nfirst role that support rule I feel like\nthat's anything something anyone could\ndo I don't know your thoughts on that\nyeah I think for me is like I think\nthat's because I'm known for making help\ndesk videos like crazy so like I'm known\nfor that but yeah for me it's just like\nhelp desk is so underrated like people\nheck yeah people think that you're not\ndoing a lot of stuff when you are you're\ndoing active directory Office 365 you're\ndoing password reset you're setting up\nnew hires terminations PC moves\nmigrations you're doing a lot of stuff\nit's not just one thing so all those\nskills that you get just from being in\nhelp desk even depends on the the level\nwill help this too because there are\ndifferent levels of tier one tier two\ntier three so you could actually do some\nsecurity responsibility or you could do\nsome networking responsibility as well\nor you could do Cloud responsibility as\nwell because I have worked with someone\nthat works help desk and he's doing\nAzure ID connect so it really depends on\nthe company that you're working for for\nhelp that so help desk is so it's so\nunderrated like it really depends on the\ncompany it really depends where you work\nbut it gives you a well-round\nfundamental knowledge so I definitely\nwill always tell someone to do help this\neven if they hate it I know people hate\nhelp desk but I don't\nI I feel I mean because there's an\naspect of customer service in it\nyou know just like retail jobs just like\nit being in like the food industry like\nyou know because you deal with people\nand ultimately people are the ones that\nmake it difficult but the role itself\nlike\nif if my help the scroll I didn't have\nto put up with customers I think I\nprobably would have enjoyed it a lot\nmore it's the people that make it kind\nof difficult but you're right there's I\nthink especially with like the\nonboarding off-boarding processes\nthere's a lot of automation that you can\nintroduce and you can learn especially\ngiven that stuff like the majority of\nthat is with um active directory in\nwhich now a lot of companies are using\nAzure so there's like there's even Some\nCloud exposure that early on but a lot\nof people want to skip it and the other\nday like dude you were you were showing\nme this and I was just so I was shocked\nyou were telling me that there were\nsometimes are like gigs in New York that\nare like oh paying 150 000 for Help Desk\nand I was like what\n150 000 if you're like if you're like a\nsingle person no kids you're you're\nliving a great life with that seller\neven even if you're in like the city\nyou're living good with that kind of\nmoney so it's not like you're going to\nbe paid like absolutely I mean you know\nthere's variations there and went up but\nyeah I tell people to not skip help desk\neither because you learn a lot but\nespecially like\ndocumentation\num ticketing systems it's pretty\nimportant troubleshooting Under Pressure\nuh you get a lot of like scenario\nfeedback scenarios that you can use in\ninterviewing and whatnot\num but and whatnot someone someone wants\nto know your opinion on the TR the\ntrifecta that ape that that CompTIA\nTrifecta what's your opinion on that\nbut like I like I always say it really\nit really depends on the company and if\nthe company could pay for it there's\nmore power to you I'm not wasting a lot\nof money on service and the thing with\nme is I'm very it's very hard for me to\nanswer that question because I I know\npeople that I have worked with that only\nhave maybe one or two shirts and that's\nit and they make a lot of money because\nthey they they got they just learned the\nright skills yeah and they just know how\nto Market themselves which is very\nimportant you gotta know how to Market\nyourself you got to have the right\nskills for the job that you want and I I\nhave examples of people that I have\ntrained myself that they're like sis\nadmins now and they don't have any\nsearch at all it's just they just they\njust have skills that's it so I'm\nextremely biased I'm always going to be\nin the middle so if you're if your job\ncould pay for it that's fine yeah uh I I\nwill say that I don't I don't agree with\nsearch chasing that's just how I am like\nyou don't need 100 certifications it\ndoesn't look good on the resumes if\nyou're brand new as well I don't like\nthat either because if you're brand new\nthey're gonna they're gonna assume\nyou're memorizing the questions and the\nanswers if you have too many\ncertifications that's just my that's\njust my thoughts all right there you go\nyeah I would agree like maybe once or I\nlike the idea of like once her one\nproject role and then you know as you\nfigure out what you want to continue\ndoing in your role you get another cert\nto kind of like take you to the next\nstep and whatnot\nbut if you're chasing them if you're\ndoing like I knew someone who who did\nlike 24 certifications in a year\nand I was just like\nI mean good on you I guess but still I I\ncould not like how do you have time to\ndo other things and whatnot but anyway\nuh what else what else is chess asking\nus here where can we find real-time\nHands-On projects for Azure 104 104's\nadministrator\nso\nthe when you study for the 104 you well\nwhen you go to the certification page\nfor the 104 you're gonna have the like\nthe learning path uh like the Microsoft\nlearning paths like a bunch of modules\nand each one of those is going to be\nlike 30 40 minutes or one hour and it's\nlike like 30 or 40 of them and\nessentially You're Building mini\nprojects in those but you have sandboxes\non Moana so what I would recommend is\nlike\ngo do those but then Implement them also\nin your own environment and then just\ntear them down but like document because\nI really what matters with projects is\nthe documentation and you being able to\nspeak to the skills that you're gaining\nI think a lot of people try to over\ncomplicate like I need to get Hands-On I\nneed to get Hands-On I need to come up\nwith this amazing like massive project\nand that's not the reality you just need\nto be able to do something so later you\ncan showcase your skill set uh and\nprobably the best way to do that is by\njust somehow like if you write about it\nif you make videos about it or whatnot\num you can have like you know with Cloud\na great thing cloud and devops a great\nthing is like you can just create the\ninfrastructure as code files and one now\nlater you can just you can destroy it\nbring it all up again and whatnot\num so I would start with like the stuff\nthat you're studying\nthen if that's not enough for you go to\nlike the architecture Center and then\ntype in a service that you're learning\nso I know like the 104 you're going to\nbe focused on maybe cost management\nvirtual machines v-nets things like that\nso type in the service name in the Azure\narchitecture Center and then just grab\none of the architectures that shows you\nwhichever one you feel like you can do\nand go and build that those are actually\nbased on like those architectures I\nnotice are based on\ncustomer interactions on like surveys\njust like there's so many there's like\nhundreds of them so there's plenty of\nprojects for you to do they do for that\ntoo\num let's see here can you talk about the\nstagnant area a lot of people deal with\nme included moving from help desk to\nsadmin Cloud when you can do the work\nbut stagnant ruined interviewee Outlook\nKev you got any insight into that\num are you usually saying that he's\nstuck in helped us and he can't move on\nto his BSS seven yeah what it is yeah\nbut they feel like because they spent\ntoo much time in help this that's kind\nof like working against them\nnah I don't I don't I don't really agree\nwith that\nI I think uh for someone that's trying\nto move into something else you should\nyou should always\num\nfigure out what certifications you need\nfirst that's one thing\num I'm gonna say I'm gonna say do do uh\ndo your homework figure out where you\nlive because all the certification stuff\nis different everywhere you live doesn't\nmatter like I could live in New York\nthey probably asked me for Azure I could\ngo some rosly perhaps me for AWS yeah I\ncould go to I don't know to another\nstate and they'll probably ask me for\nCCNA because some some CIS admin roles\nrequire you to have CCNA I seen it in a\njob posting so I really really depends\non the search so you want to do some\nresearch figure out what certification\nyou need that's the number one number\ntwo\num if you're in your current job I would\nlike to know if there's a way for you to\nget promoted within your job so we want\nto speak to your hiring manager see they\ncould promote you within your job or see\nif you could Shadow someone that's\nassistive so then you can learn those\nskills and you can add those skills to\nyour resume obviously if they don't give\nyou that then there's that means you may\nhave to leave that job and look for\nanother job and then the third thing for\nme is going to be is uh it's going to be\nyour LinkedIn profile your LinkedIn\nbranding like like I always talk about\nLinkedIn branding because some of of\nthese jobs some of these things is like\nsometimes it's not what you know it's\nwho you know so you want to make sure\nyou have a good LinkedIn brand LinkedIn\nprofile and you're you're leveling\nyourself up you're adding those\nnecessary skills that are in the job\nrequirements on the resume and then\nyou're learning those skills and you're\njust applying for jobs and you're\ntelling that resume to the job you that\nyou want that's just my thought process\non that yeah you're a you're a big fan\nof LinkedIn I I sort of got into the\nLinkedIn game a little little after so I\ndon't have too much experience with\nusing it to to like land rules but do\nyou have any like any tips any like\nquick things that people can go and just\ndo right now on their LinkedIn to\nimprove to like just make it a better\nuse of LinkedIn\nyeah yeah so I always tell people that\nLinkedIn is not Facebook that's number\none I like that number two is\num if you're if you're going on LinkedIn\nright now you could literally go to your\npage you click on the edit button you\ncan actually change the url of your\nLinkedIn profile so sometimes it has the\nedit button there like sometimes you'll\nhave like a URL that's a generic URL put\nyour name in there and then put it\nsomething something so change your URL\nname on the bottom underneath your\nunderneath your photo I guess you could\nadd like keywords of jobs that you're\nactually looking for some people will\nput system and network admin help desk\nI.T support obviously have a\nprofessional photo of you it's not that\nyou like drinking and you're doing like\na Facebook picture or Twitter picture\nyou know it has to be appropriate right\num enable the feature option on the on\nyour on your LinkedIn profile and then\nadd Project work of things that you\nactually are doing like YouTube videos\nor uh your GitHub or something like that\nand put that on the feature section so\npeople can see what you're actually\ndoing you can also add your\ncertification there so like if you have\nlike a Microsoft certification you could\nactually put it there us to have that\nyou got that certification and then at\nthe about me you want to add all the\nskills and all the things that the kids\nare used to find you so you could put\nlike help desktop support Cloud ad\nconnect whatever like like personal\nkeywords in there\num and then you want to add your\nexperience and then you want to add your\ncourses you want to add the courses\nyou're taking the volunteer work et\ncetera et cetera et cetera so that's a\nlittle a little bit of just some\nbranding I guess there we go quick\ncouple quick tips to everyone go and\napply them\num someone says here\nevent at the reactor this month I was\njust talking to Kev about this like hey\nwould you want to do like a tech Meetup\nI I used to do I wasn't doing it monthly\nmaybe like every other month at the\nreactor building in Microsoft and Times\nSquare but it would be cool we could do\na little a little networking session\num you could do like a I'd usually do\nlike a 15 minute some side type of\ntechnical Talk of the beginner beginner\nlevel and then I just have some sort of\nnetworking activity\num I did sort of like a game show one I\ndid like a human Bingo the other and I\ngave away swag and whatever stuff that I\ncan give away\num so something we could we might be\nable to organize and whatnot\num what else is on here all right\nsomeone said I found this from a Discord\nbefore\ncerts help you land jobs what aren't the\ndefinitive answer to getting a job it's\na mixture of Education work experience\npassion project inserts how do you feel\nabout passion Kev\nlike in what way passion for passion for\nwork passion for Tech like do you need\npassion to work in text you need passion\nto to get a job you don't need you don't\nneed fashion to work inside but if\nyou're doing help desk you're going to\nhave to show the hiring manager that you\nactually want to be in I.T because I've\nseen people get jobs just by having an\namazing personality because you're\nworking with with hiring managers and\nsometimes a lot of those hiring managers\nthey don't want someone that's going to\nbe toxic to the environment so they want\nsomeone that actually has good soft\nskills it has good people skills because\nat the end of the day if you're going to\nwork help desk for example right you're\nthe first line of support for picking up\nphone calls for handling users handling\ntickets they would not want someone\nthat's going to be a headache to the\nwhole environment so I definitely will\nalways say that you need to have some\nsort of personality when it comes to\ngoing to some of these jobs those people\nskills are very important especially\nwith me is I work a lot with Executives\nand\num and they're just letting you know\nright now I don't have that issue with\nwith people and talking to people\nbecause I I worked in restaurants so I\nlove working I love working with people\nI love talking to people excuse me yeah\nagain especially with with help desk I\nmean if you're in like a smaller maybe a\nmid-sized company you you you're going\nto be talking to absolutely everyone\nyou're talking about like people who are\non your team you're gonna be talking to\num you know c-level Executives like you\nmentioned uh and those are also\nopportunities for you to sort of put\nyourself out there uh through just\nconversations of like someone might just\nyou know hit up the helpless like hey my\ncomputer won't turn on\num and as maybe you're troubleshooting\nsomething and there's like some empty\ntime and then you can fill that in with\njust decent like just conversation like\nhow you doing I've through conversations\nlike that like I've kind of been\ntold a little bit about like oh future\nprojects or just things that are going\non at the company and whatnot and those\nhave been just building like networking\nbuilding kind of like just your the\npeople that know you the people that you\nknow and you never know what\nopportunities can come from that and\nthat's something very unique to help\nthis very few roles will give you\nexposure to absolutely every level and\neveryone at a company like helped us\num so that's one of the cool things\nabout it I know someone says here how\nwould you go about moving into it in\nyour current work I'm in manufacturing\nstill working on my search like AWS\nCloud practitioner\num\nall right so just a heads up for people\nI usually ask like when you say getting\ninto it you got to kind of tell me or in\nthis case tell us like what's that goal\nof yours like what role you're trying to\nget into\num\nand and sort of like what projects\nyou've done what kind of certifications\nyou're coming what kind of education you\ncome you have at the moment and then we\ncan kind of be a little bit more\ntailored advice instead of just general\nlike\noh starting\nI don't know do this or whatnot right uh\nyeah someone says get hands experience\nhome lab Homeland I'd say home lab and\nland to help this role then work towards\nthe collateral yeah if that's what\nyou're trying to get into Cloud uh let's\nsee what other questions are we got here\num\nwell I saw one that I wanted to answer\nare there free AWS projects or is azure\ncontent the same\nuh you can any project that you build in\nany Cloud you can just build it in the\nother one like there's the cloud resume\nproject the majority of people have done\nit in AWS now\nbut I usually recommend like go do that\nin like another cloud and then you get\nyou don't really have to think of\nanother project to do you just gotta\nhave to learn how to implement it in\ndifferent Cloud now you can even make it\nmulti-cloud which I think would be an\ninteresting idea\num Kev what's your experience with who\nused AWS at all\nuh not a lot just a little bit\num I use I use more Azure than AWS yeah\nso what's the uh this is how I am what's\nthe uh what kind of things are you doing\nin Azure it's like uh mini like identity\nkind of stuff\nuh just just regular um just security\ngroups and active directory Azure Cloud\ndirectory nothing crazy yeah yeah ad\nconnects and just like simple stuff\nnothing I think crazy a a d is\nsuch an underrated skill because 80 is\none so 80 in monitoring are the two\nservices that are implemented in\nabsolutely every single Azure service\nand if you know how to use 80 the right\nway like how to properly have roles and\nwhatnot then you're already in in a way\nyou have experience with the majority of\nazure cloud services\num I\nI don't have too much experience with\non-prem ad but I'm assuming you you like\nyou know that stuff in and out\nyeah yeah yeah yeah I I just know that\nit's if it's something that's not\nimplemented the right way it can go\nwrong\nso easily I remember\nbecause I remember I think it was my\nhealth desk gig where\nthey were just like you know clicking\nthey were creating users from scratch\npretty much like right click new user\nfinlet audit and there was like no\ntemplates there was no like policies\nthere was nothing absolutely nothing you\nand then always you know when someone\nwent on board and there was like no\nautomation for any of that so when\nsomeone went on board they never had\num because the putting someone in the\nright group would give them the right\npermissions to the location that they\nwere in and then they would put them in\nthe wrong location so then they couldn't\nlog in when they were at and it was just\nlike it was just like a mess\num if you have any like\nuh resources for people to learn 80.\nany recommendations\nI mean I have videos on active directory\nso yeah there you go yeah I have videos\non active directory oh yeah I have\nvideos on active directory and I'm gonna\nI'm working on um I'm working on a\ncourse right now but hopefully when I'm\ndone with that on ad get that going uh\nyes\noh hold on yeah I think my camera froze\nlet me see that camera froze yep\nworking on a um\nworking on the course so\noh there's something all right here we\ngo\nokay yeah I I'm working on a course\nright now so I I do have a udemy course\num and I'm working on another course\nright now but this is going to be like\num Like A to Z like some some a plus\nstuff in there like because some people\nare not good with fundamentals I'm gonna\ncover active directory I'm gonna cover\noffice 365. nice A little bit of\neverything so three three six five is\nalso a Gateway into Cloud I would say\nwell I mean it is the cloud but more so\nbecause a lot of a lot of companies that\nend up going to Azure is because of\ntheir relationship with 365 or their use\nof 365. so\nif you kind of have like already know\nhow to utilize it and same thing with ad\num\nyou're gonna have already kind of like\nthe upper hand when you want to work or\nmaybe for a migration or maybe you want\nto work at Azure shop or whatnot like\nhaving that skill set already is like\nit's like pretty key there too\num let's see here\nhow can I apply the knowledge I have\nacquired through Azure certificates do\nyou have\num\nAzure certifications Kev\nI literally I literally just have a plus\nis expired I just have skills\nI didn't ask you that you don't so you\nhaven't expired a plus and that's the\nonly cert you have at the moment yeah\nyep it's crazy right did you did you\never take any other certs\nat all that was the only one\nyep so you got so all right so talk to\nme about that first tech roll so did you\nhow did that how did that happen\nlike how did you get that first one I I\num I got I got the first one because I\nhave that but my having day plus there's\na requirement you have to have the A\nPlus in that job\num and then um I I uh I got my other\njobs just to learning myself like I'm\nself-taught I don't have any I didn't I\ndon't have any like um certifications\nbesides the a plus\num and I I do have the acmt the Apple\nStore Apple certified Macintosh\ntechnician certification as well those\ntwo\num but that's expires like old\num and uh I got yeah I got my first job\nuh field tech a plus\num long story short and I have a video\nand I talked about it uh making nine\ndollars an hour for my first job in 19\nand um I uh I I got after that I I\nwanted to learn more so I did I\nliterally I literally like bust my ass\nI'm like just studying and learning I\nliterally went I I learned about\nvirtualbox I learned about\num active directory server 20 2012 or\ntwo at that time and um I build my own\nhome lab and everything I add those\nskills to my resume and I apply for an\nMSP company and the reason they hired me\nwas because I had a home lab experience\nI was able to explain what is active\ndirectory what is distribution group\nwhat are security groups um uh what\nhappens when you add someone to a group\nor or why should we not give someone\naccess to all these folders or just one\nfolder right so they really like those\nanswers so then I got a job for an MSP\ncompany and that that company was where\nI I got a lot of my experience I was\nexposed to a lot of different\num companies within the atmosphere and\nthey had multiple hedge funds so I\nworked for like over eight to nine hedge\nfunds in a non-profit as well and\nthat's where I um that's where I got a\nlot of experiences I was touching\neverything yeah and um\nI transferred that over to hedge funds\nafter that and I started making more\nmoney more money and more money because\nof the skills and everything and um and\nand I was I'm very aggressive so I\nworked for the MSP company they will\ngive out bonuses and stuff like that so\nI was closing about 12 1200 to 1400\ntickets a month\njust by I was number one every every\nevery month I was number one in on the\nMSP company because I was very\naggressive and\num and you you know you know how it goes\nlike when you when you want that grind\nyou want those bonuses you go in you go\nall in I go in so I feel like that's\nthat's how I am but I have no I have no\ncertifications were you were you using\nlike for that first role were you using\nlike job descriptions for like\nessentially like study guides for you to\nfigure out what you needed to to study\nor or was it like at the beginning you\nwere just kind of just learning\neverything\nI was kind of learning everythingwould you recommend that approach or\nwould you recommend people kind of like\nreverse engineer it now\num so for me for me the number one thing\nI think is very important for anyone in\num that's new to it is learning how to\nlearn\nso if you learn if you if you learn if\nyou learn how to learn you could do it\nyou could be you could pretty much do\nanything in it so basically what that\nmeans is learn learn how to learn\nsomething so you may be Hands-On you may\nnot be Hands-On you'd be good with a\nbook you may not be good with a book\nfigure out how you learn yeah and then\ngo based on that and then you can\nreverse engineer that and then you can\nstart learning these skills that you\nactually need for the job market so\nthere you go\nI like that too yeah learning how to\nlearn this is important Germaine says\nhere MSP set you up lovely with\nexperience yeah I feel I don't\nhave to I've worked with msps as like we\nwere their clients but I haven't like\nworked at one\num but yeah I can imagine like you just\nkind of kind of see like customers out\nof all different types of ranges and\nsizes and whatnot\num so yeah I could I could see it being\nlike a pretty cool gig for a little bit\nmight be a little overwhelming at some\npoint\num let me see here's a good one so what\ndoes this admin actually do like what\nwould a day-to-day be like that's a good\nquestion\n[Music]\num\nis this admin it really depends on the\ncompany to be honest for you yeah but I\nknow people that have CIS admin titles\nand they don't even do anything since\nI'm related but\num to be honest with you um for me I I\ndo I deal with I deal with with\num what I do is I deal with OCTA I deal\nwith OCTA admin portal\num I deal with\num Splunk varonis\num crowdstrike\num\nuh active directory\num new hires terminations\num Citrix citrus cloud uh Centric Studio\nCitrix director uh we're a VMware shop\nso I deal with VMware I deal with VMware\nclusters\num we have\num\nwe have a lot of things set up on VM so\nwe do we do VMS from scratch so I do\nupgrades patches\num same thing upgrades and patches using\nsscm we use sscm over here in my job um\nso I do patches like that as well we do\ncreate software packages as well so like\nif someone needs someone needs something\nwe actually provision it so they could\nsee it in software Center and stuff like\nthat so\num my job's not boring I do a little bit\nof everything so it's pretty pretty\ninteresting and I'm also an admin for\nfor uh for uh SharePoint uh and I do\nthings on SharePoint as well and Office\n365 and exchange and all that all the\ngood stuff it's not it's not just one\nthing all over the place so\ndo you is that where\nlike you very much like the role are you\ntrying to make moves or like like where\nare you at right now with that uh I I I\nlike my job but I am I'm I may be\nlooking for a cyber security role I'm\nnot sure yet but we'll see yeah we'll\nsee we'll see I I uh I'm not sure yet\nwe'll see is that do you think you\nlike are you like upskilling already or\nis it something like you're thinking\nabout doing or\num for cyber security I'm I'm thinking\nabout it I'm thinking about it because I\nI've been I've been doing like try hack\nme I have a video on Hector I have a\nhack video on hack the Box on my YouTube\nchannel so I do I I'm like I'm slowly\ngoing into security because people have\nbeen watching you made a video on OCTA\nwhat's going on right now yeah yeah yeah\nso yeah I'm slowly going into it that\nsecurity space is wild it's like it's a\nlot of money there especially that cloud\nsecurity space I think there's a that's\na big Niche I feel like if people aren't\nlike set on a rolling cloud like\nI feel like maybe take a look at that I\nthink just like I released and read an\narticle about uh Microsoft like\ninvesting\ninto like a cyber security curriculum at\na bunch of different community colleges\nall over the country because\num\nit's understaffed like the whole the\nspace every security is just not enough\npeople to feel like to fill the roles\nand whatnot and I read somewhere like on\naverage like you're making like like\nentry-level security rules you're making\nanywhere from 80k to like up like higher\nand whatnot so\nit's cool space I know it's\nkind of tough to break into but uh\nthere's a lot of potential there so if\nanyone is interested I would say give it\na shot\nlet's see here\num\nsystem could be networking literally\nscripting for ad and that's all they\ncare about kept like you could easily\nget into cyber security role with all\nthat\nthere you go I don't yeah I don't know\nanything see I want to like learn about\nsecurity just just to know a little bit\nmore about it but I don't really it's\nnot really like necessarily like a pivot\nto the rule or whatnot because I just\nfeel like I have no idea about it uh\nhere's good yeah I\nI was going to say that I I met John\nHammond so oh he talked about it yeah I\nmet John Hyman in person because I I had\nto do a presentation\num I spoke in a presentation in Texas a\ncouple like a month ago actually I made\nanother presentation so I met John\nHammond and I met someone that watches\nmy YouTube videos like dude literally\njust gave me a hug out of nowhere I'm\nlike what the that's cool and then\num I I met\num uh this company right here pgq they\nactually took pictures of me because I\nmean I have a video with PDQ I made a\nvideo on their stuff so they took\npictures with me and um I I had to speak\nyou know I met John Hammond we were just\ntalking about cyber security\num uh Huntress the company he works for\nand just like oh okay I didn't know I\ndidn't know you could do this or that or\nthe different types of roles right I met\nsomeone that does you are seeing over\nthere it was very interesting very\ninteresting stuff\nyep let me take a look at what else we\ngot here\nkevtech how much does knowing the\ntrading software matter in your\nday-to-day troubleshooting what is the\ntrading software do you know what you're\ntalking about he knows what I'm talking\nI know he's talking about so because I\nwork for a fintech company I work for\nfinancial services uh so if you if you\ndo help desk\num so you guys are aware you guys just\nit's a niche it's a niche thing right\nit's not really like but if you work\nfinancial services and you work help\ndesk like that does all the jobs that\ntypically they pay over 100k so for\nfinancial services only helped us in\nfinancial services and that's that's\nbecause you need to know how to\ntroubleshoot Financial applications like\ntrading software like King mentioned\nright so you may need to know how to\ntroubleshoot cap IQ mcavic is Bloomberg\nBloomberg terminal Bloomberg technology\nthose things are actually on the job\nposting when you go and apply for a\nhelpless role it pays that much money so\nif you know if you know anything about\nthat then you could make a lot of money\nbecause I always talk about this and I\ndon't like talking about money because\nsome people like nah you can't make that\nmuch I'm like no I'll show you I'll show\nyou you're gonna make a lot of money and\nhelp that's working for a financial firm\nthat's great I did not know about Niche\nI saw I know I know helped us got a lot\nof helpless but I didn't know that there\nwas like a niche that would pay\nthat that like when you talk was that\nthat one that you were telling me that\nwas like 150 was that like in one of\nthose types overall oh man yeah it's\nFinancial Financial Services like I I\nhelp someone I I literally just changed\nthe topic a little bit I helped someone\nthat worked for a financial firm in\nTexas making 95k that was his first job\nin I.T he only has a computer site he\nonly has a computer science degree and\nthat's it and he learned for me and I\ntrained them on that software the\nBloomberg software and a few other\napplications as well and his first job\nmaking 90 from now he's not even doing\nthat anymore now he's a he's a lead of a\nsoftware team so it's totally different\nI have to get him back on my Channel at\nsome point but so so what about the\ntraining for those specific applications\nit's like is that something that you can\nfind on YouTube or is a little more like\nis it tougher to find content on that uh\nno it's not like it's not really it's\nlike it's like more like it has to be\nmade by me or somebody that yeah I feel\nlike it'd be more Niche because I've\nI've never heard of that that's cool\nyeah that's cool that's cool yeah yeah\ny'all like if\nyeah like I think it's all about those\nniches it's all about those niches like\ncloud is great but Cloud security is\nlike crazy money like like help desk\nwhen it comes to like that Finance space\nlike it's gonna it sounds like it's\ncrazy too so that's cool I didn't know\nthat that's I'm glad this person asked\nthat question here let me see yeah it's\nlike it's like uh you know you know like\nuh like help desk for um uh for for like\nthe like the hospitals and stuff like\nthat yeah EMS system and stuff like that\nHealthcare yeah you make a lot of money\nout of that too it's helped us too you\nmade a lot of money if you know how to\nuse the EMS softwares and stuff like\nthat yeah I'm about to go start my own\nHelp Desk Companythat's crazy man that's crazy yeah what\nwe got here\num would you recommend volunteering for\nexperience volunteering at schools for\nexperience what do you think about\nvolunteering for experience\nuh they could do volunteer work I've I\nvolunteer Myself by the way so I I\nalways recommended it yeah like now\ncurrent day yeah yes how\nhow do you keep up with it all\nyeah I volunteer I worked for Rice's\ncyber so racist cyber is a cyber\nsecurity non-profit organization that uh\nthey do like free education for\nminorities in I.T African Americans\nlatinx Hispanics and stuff like that I'm\npart of that so\nso now now I need a recap of all the\nthings that you do so you work you do\nYouTube you're doing this volunteer work\nwhat else you got on your plate you're\nmaking courses what else you got I'm\nmaking making courses I literally was on\non vets At Con yesterday working with\nthem yesterday I actually joined their\nDiscord so I work a lot with Veterans as\nwell I do training with veterans and um\nlike it's free it's free for them like\nif you if you if you're a veteran and\nyou you want to jump on a car with me\nit's going to be free free I'm not going\nto charge you anything oh\num I do a little bit of everything so\nI'm all over the place you do I'm on 45\ndifferent discords soto talk to you about I know you do\nmentoring calls too\nwow yeah yeah is that like anyone can\nbook some time to just talk to you or\nwhat's that like\num so that that's paid that one is paid\nso like if you're gonna if I'm gonna sit\nhere and I'm gonna give you like a plan\nand everything and tell you how to do\nthis and that that's paid yeah so that's\nthat's on my website you go to my\nwebsite and\num you know go go to do that\nare you sort of do you hold yourself\naccountable for that person's success\nthough that's always my issue with\nmentoring is like yeah yeah if they\ndon't make it then I feel like I'm I'm\nkind of part to blame\nso with me it's like you're stuck with\nme until you get a job so that's just\nthat's just how it was that that's\nthat's how it was with me on my Discord\ntoo if you've been on my Discord so on\nmy Discord I ran you can't you can't see\nthe channels because they're invisible\nbut I ran four four internships for free\npaid by me and I keep you accountable\nonce you get a job at 19. they all got\njobs at 19. so it's just like you got to\nkeep yourself accountable for stuff like\nthat if you're helping yourself so\nyou're so your mentoring is until they\nland a role yeah yeah that's what I like\nbut the majority of mentoring I've seen\nis like come here I'll give you advice\nyou gotta pay my hundred dollars and I\ndon't really care what ends up happening\nwith you as long as you pay me because\nbecause mentoring is really like it's\ngot to be a two-way thing it's got to be\nbeneficial for\nor something that's got to come out of\nit for both parties because then that's\nhow you know it's like you know because\nyou really like you want an outcome well\nI guess technically getting paid is an\noutcome but then the other person I\ndon't know it's just it's true I feel\nbad I feel bad like I take an advantage\nof someone like that I won't do that see\nlike it's like the other person I told\nyou I paid twenty thousand dollars he\ncame crying to me like physically like\nliterally crying a thousand dollars and\nI'm like I don't even charge that much\nthat's too much who the hell charges\nthat much the hell is this so you know\nit's like it's like you know like for me\nit's like I don't like to abuse people\nyou know like we don't do that right\nespecially with me because I come from\nhumble beginnings I do not like to do\nthat to other people that's just messed\nup just straight up messed up twenty\nthousand dollars is crazy man that's\nlike a brand new car that's like a house\ndown payment it's like a semester like a\nyear of college that's like a whole WGU\ndegree man that's crazy that see that\nstuff upsets me so like so much but\nanyway we don't need to start ranting oh\nwhat up Tech with Lucy everyone\nTaco Lucy's here her Channel's I don't\nknow I feel like you're about to hit 50k\nuh and if you're interested in AWS Cloud\nstuff Tech Lucia's channel to watch and\nthen Lucy we gotta get you on one of\nthese these these\nq a I guess sessions and whatnot uh\nif you're interested let me know but\nanyway\num\nlet's see what else we got here\nuh can I can I put count volunteering as\nexperience yeah absolutely if you're if\nyou're volunteering uh whether if it's\nlike\nany kind of in any kind of professional\nsetting\nabsolutely put it on there\num\nI think that is\nbecause you're working\njust because you're not getting paid it\ndoesn't mean it's not work\nsame thing with projects like projects\nyou're technically not getting paid but\nif they're gonna help you showcase your\nskills so they should be on your resume\nas well you said kind of got to be smart\nand detailed with how you like put them\non your resume and whatnot but yeah\nabsolutely all that stuff should go on\nthere\num Kev helped me build my first lab and\nget my first it job 22 an hour now doing\ntier two and now working on getting into\ndevops yo\nnice that's cool man\nthat's that's freaking awesome\num yeah that's really awesome look at\nthat changing lives right thereuh let's see here\nuh GPS why don't you allow people to\nsend you money because I don't need it\nuh I don't\nI don't I said it's not that I don't\nneed it's like I don't want it from\ny'all\nI want to take it from Microsoft I want\nto take it from me I want to take the\nmoney from the companies that have\nbillions and billions I don't want to\ntake it from people who are like trying\nto get into into the space\nuh that's why I tailored my content I\nmake my content and I do it in\nsustainable ways where I don't feel like\nI need to make extra to do what I do\num so I was gonna I was gonna say not to\ninterrupt you I was going to say that\nI'm a tech trainer So like\num I do work with job skills here so I'm\nnot sure you're familiar with job\nskillshare he has a YouTube channel\num he has 80 000 subscribers\num I'm friends with him so I do do I do\ndo tech training on his platform I train\npeople over there um that's obviously\nnot free you got to pay for that but the\nthing is ours is like our training is\nvery affordable and I we help five\npeople get jobs in 19. through our\nthrough our training\num one of the guys that I trained he\nStephen he got a job working for connect\nwise so\num it's just like that's a big name yeah\nI I just I know I know our stuff works\nbecause I I trained I trained students I\ntrained a lot of students in uh on his\nchannel if you watch any of his videos I\nI trained someone his name is Brad uh he\ngot his first help desk job 17 years old\num now he's 18 he's a sister admin now\nso I feel like ahead of the game right\nthere I feel like anyone could get a job\nin it you just got to have the right\nmindset and you gotta just you gotta be\nmotivated and don't give up so easily\nthat's like my that's my number one\nthing I teach my students is never give\nup never give up no matter what because\nI feel like uh I feel like when you work\nwhen you try to get a job in it it's\nlike you when you go good for a job just\ngetting any job in it just going into it\nin general it feels like you're it feels\nlike you're Rocky you're getting hit so\nmany times right and then no one gives\nyou a chance you're getting hit you're\ngetting hit you're getting hit and then\nfinally someone gives you a chance and\nsomeone opens the door and gives you a\nchance and then once you get that first\njob it just go up after that right so\nthat's how I look at it and I train my\nstudents to think that way because I\ndon't want you to give up so easily it's\nso discouraging too and also it's a\nfull-time job in itself just to get a\njob so tell people not to give up that's\nmy thing I would also say that if you if\nyou've been at it for a while in a while\na while a while and you're like you keep\ngetting rejected and you keep feeling\nlike you're not making progress you\ngotta kind of take a second to be like\nand kind of like Get reflective being\nlike all right what is it that I'm doing\nwrong maybe you're following the wrong\nadvice maybe you're not doing like\nsomething maybe you're not telling your\nresume maybe you're sending one generic\nresume to every single role maybe you're\nnot putting in the work in some specific\narea so it's like this this getting into\nthe space is very it's like doable it's\npossible many people have done it but if\nit's taking you too long and you're\nfinding yourself with like loud a lot of\nlike Roblox like take a second to kind\nof like research like what it is that\nyou know that is going on because like\nKev said it's like it's like it's a job\nfinding a job but each time it kind of\ngets like\nlike\nnot easier but simpler because what you\nlearn from that first round you get that\nfirst job now you go and apply that when\nyou go to the next one to the next one\nthe next one it becomes like a little\nbit more straightforward and whatnot but\ninterviewing is like oh my goodness dude\nwe could talk about interviewing\nit's it's a skill set on completely its\nown which is why I put like so much\nemphasis on people to like develop\ntheir ability to speak to their skill\nset\nbecause if you're like all nervous in an\ninterview like people are gonna like\nit's almost like they sniff that out\nand then like you were mentioned like\nearlier on people want to hire someone\nwho\nit's like not gonna like kind of lower\nlike team morale who's not gonna be like\na complicated person who's gonna put in\nthe work and just like work with the\nteam and I that in your interview is\nessentially your kind of one opportunity\nto showcase that that's who you are and\nif you're going in all nervous and\nyou're like you're not prepared\nyou're gonna kind of kind of blow it do\nyou like do you remember like your first\ninterviews like do you have any prep\ntips or any advice you got on on just\nlike specifically interviewing\num for me I always tell people to uh\nhave someone have a loved one or a\nfamily member interview you for practice\nyeah um I also the other thing with me\nis I like to interview I'll probably\nrecord myself interviewing see how I\nanswer some questions that'll be the\nsecond thing I would do and then the\nthird the third thing is\num there's a lot of there's a lot of\npeople that if you reach out to them you\nreach out to someone that could just do\ninterviews you just have a conversation\nwith you just practice with someone\num the fourth thing would be if you guys\ndon't know anything about this but\nToastmasters does it I'm not sure maybe\nwith Toastmasters but Toastmasters is a\ncompany that does like speaking and\npresenting and talking so if you know\nhow to do that that's going to help you\nwith interviews because you need to have\nconfidence it's the same thing for a job\nby the way too especially when you're\nworking with Executives and if you if\nyou don't have confidence and you're\nworking with someone you're working one\nof the sea levels because I have workers\nI gotta ask you to leave the room so\nthis is that's how it is with the\nexecutive so you really gotta know you\nreally gotta know your I'm just\nsaying like that's just how it is with\ninterviews as well you gotta know your\nstuff because if you don't know your\nstuff they know that you're full of crap\nand that's that's one thing the other\nthing is don't rely on your resume so if\nyou have something on your resume and\nthey ask you an interview question about\nthat it's like oh shoot I don't know how\nto answer that question so those things\nare very important I uh a friend of mine\nhe he was talking about the story that\nhe once put that he had SQL experience\non his resume just randomly for some\nreason\nand on his interview uh someone asked\nhim like Hey I want to like I don't know\ndrop this table or do something like\njoin this table or something a sequel\nlike can you show me how to do it and he\njust froze\nhe's like he's like you know what I lied\nuh but he ended up I think he ended up\ndoing well though\num for whatever other reason I think\nbecause of that mistake like they ended\nup having conversations around other\nskill since and whatnot but like yeah I\ndon't really understand because like uh\nthe the lying or like the lie on your\nresume or like fake into your makeup\nlike\nat some point you're gonna get caught\nand then you're gonna you're gonna kind\nof regret those those decisions and\nwhatnot but yeah yeah that's that's a\ntough one\num I like the idea of having other\npeople interviewing and like one area\nthat I would like to\nprovide more of or do any of it's just\nlike mock interviewing do you do you do\nany of that I do I do I have I have\nvideos on YouTube with people the guy\nsweating I'm like interviewing someone\nhe's sweating uh because I I did one\ninterview with so he got a job though he\ngot a job\num his name is Fred um I interviewed him\nhe's one of the students I train and I\nwe we interview him live\num it was live with with with uh YouTube\nand with LinkedIn so LinkedIn had like\n500 people staring at the video while I\nwas live with him and I gave him like uh\nI gave him like a broken VM and I'm like\nokay I need you to fix it right now it's\nlike okay and he's remote and he's\ntrying to fix it he's trying to\ntroubleshoot it trying to figure out how\nto get it to work and then he fixes and\nthen like his confidence went up 100 and\nI feel like oh damn I didn't know that\nwas the fix and he fixed it oh man I\nspent 30 minutes on this and that was\nthe fix oh come on I got a lot of doing\nthat with Cloud stuff yeah a lot of\npeople he got he got a job he got he got\na job working for VMware so a lot of I\nfeel like a lot of people just need to\nbecome a little bit more comfortable but\nwith being watched as you're working on\nsomething or just being like seen by\nsomeone as you're explaining something\nbecause that pressure that pressure that\nyou get and honestly it comes back to\nhelp this you get a lot you get you get\nyour end users watching you as you're\ntrying to figure out right there in live\nlike what's going on at help desk and I\nfeel like every time I after that I was\ninterviewing after doing that year and a\nhalf I held this like it was like oh\nthis is kind of just like another\nscenario like oh they you know do this\ndo that whatever technical interview or\nwhatever or like I think I was\ninterviewing more so in like technical\num like with technical interviews during\nlike pandemic so a lot of it was teams\nand zoomed and whatnot\num\nbut like a lot of people need to put\nthemselves in that scenario for like\njust being watched as they work because\nthat kind of unlocks\nsomething that's tough to tap into\nyeah we have the we have that so a job\nskills share a YouTube channel I\nmentioned right we have that we just\ndon't call the hot seat so basically\nWhat's called the hot seat is we have\nseven manage seven people that are have\nexperience and they give this person a\nmessed up VM like services or messed up\nWindows 10 the operating system it may\nhave a virus you don't know it's just\ncertain things on it on purpose so you\ngot to figure out how to fix it and then\nwe're all we're all just staring at you\nso it's like seven eight videos on that\nit's so funny like the reaction of the\npeople that were helping but they all\ngot jobs at it it helps them right it\nhelps right so it does help so\ndefinitely I like I need to do more of\nthat I stopped doing that I did that\nlike a year ago I need to do more of\nthat to bring people in and just I like\nto mess with people I give them a messed\nup VM and here you go you fix it\noh yeah like because that's\nrealistic right like that's the kind of\nstuff that you're gonna be kind of\nthrown in to do at the role like that's\nthat's that's what I don't like about\num\nkind of like coding interviews or like\nalgorithms and data structures and stuff\nlike that because it's not very\nrealistic but I really like a lot more\nof like the sad man network admin Cloud\nwomen's Cloud support roles that's why\nlike it's really something can be like\nvery practical that it's actually part\nof the role and whatnot\num let me see you got a lot we got a lot\nof\ngot a lot of hellos the big ball of\nazure Guy saying hey uh what up the big\nbald Azure guy we got Mike Daniel asks\nhere\nGPS how much do you think you would make\nif you got transferred to a cheaper\nState like Texas would you get paid the\nsame or would you wage go decrease\num\nI would not go I would never accept my\nwage to be decreased for any reason\nbut that's because I know my worth\num so if I was going to make a move I\ndon't have any interest in living in\nTexas so I don't think that would be an\nissue or moving anywhere outside of the\nEast Coast\nbut if I were to move somewhere I were\nat my way my my wage would need to be\nconsidered\num there's no way in hell that I'm not\nletting that happen\nso that answers that question\num\nlet me see GPS should try to that but on\ncloud services stuff that would be\npretty cool yeah I would love to be like\nI would love to like have someone on and\nbe like hey I need you to tell me\nexactly how much this service costs in\nthe description subscription and like so\nI can see their cost management skills\nor hey I need you to find the uh I need\nto use the Azure CLI to tell me the\nprivate IP address of this virtual\nmachine something like that I feel like\nthat would be cool just to see what\npeople try to do I feel like that would\nbe pretty pretty interesting I mess with\npeople though like I do I do both I do\nsoft skills too like like tell me why I\nshouldn't I hire you or uh to uh uh tell\nme about yourself or what is your\ngreatest weakness or how do you work\nwell with it do you work well with other\nteam member or how do you do with the\nother two like I asked those annoying\npersonality questions it doesn't matter\nI like I like the question about tell me\na time you got negative feedback and how\ndid you take it yeah and sometimes\npeople like the thing is like you'll\nalways get these types of things will\nhappen will happen in in your role or\nwhatnot and people just tend to like not\nremember them or they forget them or\nlike they don't write them down but I\nwould say like whenever you feel like\nyou have an impactful thing that has\nhappened uh like a customer scenario or\nanything kind of like save it somewhere\nwrite it down like you don't need to put\nin the exact details because that might\nbe like under NDA or something like that\nbut kind of be able to take the essence\nof that because later on when you're\ninterviewing that stuff's gonna help for\nsure\nwe keep getting questions on the current\njob market you want to talk about that\nthe economy is in a weird place and some\npeople are struggling to get jobs and\nlaid off left and right it seemsum yeah\n[Music]\nso let's we gotta\nwe gotta we gotta kind of divide that\nquestion up there\nwith\nlet's talk about being laid off first\num because that's kind of like a thought\nlike I don't know do you feel like this\ndo you do you feel like\noh I'm gonna get fired but like every\nday\ndo you ever feel like that\nno you don't feel like that I feel like\nthat every single day the only day that\nI don't feel like oh I'm gonna get fired\nis it was a day that I got promoted back\nin May then that was the day I allowed\nmyself to like not feel like that but\nthen every day after that I'm like oh my\nGod I'm gonna get fired I'm gonna fire\nso it makes me very like smart with my\nwith my finances and whatnot which I\nguess\nthere might be healthier ways of doing\nthat but uh anyway so I always have the\nmindset of like\nyou could get laid off and as much as I\nenjoy my role and whatnot I'm very much\naware that like business is business\nbecause this business both ways like you\ngotta you gotta guess much you gotta do\nas much for the company and whatnot as\nthey require but they also have to be\ndoing that for you so it's like business\nboth ways and at the end of the day they\nwant to make money so if they got a\nwhole department to like you know fix\ntheir numbers or improve their numbers\nor whatever it is I got to do they're\ngonna do it they're not gonna care if\nlike you\nyou Gwen are like amazing at this like\nif they gotta cut they'll cut you so\nlike that's the kind of mindset this\nlike no one is sort of\nsafe I don't know how you feel about it\nhow do you feel about like laid off my\nmind says crazy my mindset is crazy\nbecause I\nI I always I always say treat yourself\nlike an MVP\num that's just how I am treat yourself\nlike an MVP\num at the end of the day if you work for\na company and I and I and I said this in\nother YouTube videos\num and at the end of the day you weren't\nfor company if you die tomorrow your\njob's gonna be there online again that's\njust how I feel about it yeah facts it's\njust that's just how I feel about it and\nthat's I'm just saying facts and the\nother thing is is\num the job that you're apply the job\nyou're going for nobody cares about your\nfeelings just that's just how it is in\nit because I've been I've been in and\nI've been in jobs I was very cutthroat\num a lot of red flags and like I left\nthe company they're like okay bye see\nyou later yeah all right you never give\nme anything okay bye you know so that's\njust how I feel it I feel like you\nshould you should treat yourself like an\nMVP yeah and when you're going for a job\ninterview make sure you're interviewing\nthem and they're interviewing you and\nyou need to find out that you feel well\nwith them and they follow up with you so\nif you don't do that you're gonna be in\ntrouble that's just my my thought\nprocess always be your number one fan\nand always look out for yourself because\nno one else is gonna I'm like you're\ngonna encounter great people great teams\ngreat bosses and I've been super\nfortunate to have like really fantastic\nmanagers in my past and in my like\ncurrently but\nyou if you're not advocating for\nyourself if you're not like you're sort\nof keeping a record of the stuff you're\ndoing speaking to the things putting\nyourself in situations where you stick\nout where people can know your name and\nwhatnot no one else is going to do that\nlike No One's Gonna Be on your back like\noh like you Gwen did this or like oh\nlike you know like no if you don't do\nthat\nlike you know\nNo One's Gonna No One's Gonna look be\nlooking out for you so I was like We'll\nalways kind of have like that mindset as\nfar as like the freezes\nso I was paying a lot of attention about\nthis kind of stuff lately uh not lately\nbut like maybe the last month or so and\nthen I was like all right at this point\nit just doesn't make much sense to kind\nof keep up to date with that but like\nall like a lot of big Tech Has are has\ngot freezes going on or layoffs I know I\nknow Microsoft laid off like a thousand\npeople last week or something like that\nand then prior to that there was like\nanother couple thousand back in August\nand\num Mata is like I don't know on the\ndownfall I know Google's been doing some\nI know anyway all these companies and\nwhatnot\nuh I don't know how like government tech\njobs are doing because like my my worry\nwas like so I know startups are doing\nlayoffs freezes or completely shutting\ndown I know but now big Tech but I don't\nknow more so like traditional companies\nand whatnot like where they're at where\nthey're at our government so I feel like\nif we start seeing that then it's kind\nof like oh snap like we're headed for\ntougher times but I don't I'm never\nreally up to date with where that's\nwhere that's at the moment but at this\npoint it's still like\nyou know you could have like a like the\nbest market and still not land a role\nso like keep applying keep changing that\nresume keep going keep going like don't\nlet it stop you like maybe it'll be\ndifficult but\nyeah I'm saying that that job Mark is\nlike in the middle now it's kind of hard\nto determine what's gonna happen in the\nnext couple of the next couple of months\nof the next year but\num like I always tell people you should\nmake sure that\nuh you know the right you have the right\nskills\num and you level yourself up like crazy\nbecause you don't know what could happen\nso always be always have that mindset\nthat you want to don't get don't get\ndon't stay in one split don't stay in\none place don't get too comfortable yeah\num make sure you learn the right skills\nbecause\num like I said before earlier like\num sometimes something could happen to\nyou you don't know right or they let you\ngo but you got to make sure you have the\nright skills you make sure you level\nyourself but make sure you make yourself\nrecession-proof is what I'm trying to\nsay so you want to make sure that you\nyou know you you not only you have your\njob like I made a video on this on\nYouTube but not only you have a job but\nyou you have different Avenues of income\njust in case something were to happen to\nyou in that job that's just my thought\nprocess on that as well so yeah I'm\ntrying to get into real estate I'm\ntrying to leave New York though I'm\nleaving New York next year for sure\nthat's a fact man I'm um it's been nice\nbut it's way too expensive here way too\nexpensive like it's yeah I'm like with\nthe money I'm making like I could live\nin like a like a multi-family do like a\nhouse hacking kind of thing and then\nkind of just continue purchasing like\nproperties and whatnot someone said here\nlike wait I saw a funny comment here\nwhere was it\nuhuh oh my goodness it was something about\nuh you'll be fine if you get fired but\nyou might have to move to Texas\nthat was funny that was funny that was\nfunny yeah no no yeah I'm trying I'm\ntrying to like diversify that cash\nthough yeah um but just like you were\nsaying like you gotta have multiple\nstreams of income and smart\nuh whereas I saw another company another\nquestion here\nis the ms-900s certification useful in\nyour daily job\nI don't know what the ms-900 is\nI I don't I don't keep up with\ncertification I'm ms-900\nthat's that's crazy man you only have an\nexpired a plus I swear yeah I swear oh\nthat's a 365 fundamentals\noh okayI don't I don't I've not used that\ncertification so I wouldn't know I\nhaven't I haven't used it either but\nyeah I don't have any\nthat's crazy that is I I don't know I\nfeel I don't know why I felt like\nyou would have more but that's there we\ngo people like\nyou know kev's in here making making\nthat money and he has expired a plus\nthat's all a certification\nand I don't and I don't have a degree\nand no degree there just pure experience\npure experience projects and whatnot let\nme see uh\nuh wait GPS what exactly is the position\nof Microsoft because I couldn't find any\nCloud jobs for Microsoft you couldn't\nfind any Cloud jobs at Microsoft what\nare you talking about\nwhat are you what are you not looking\nlike you're probably not looking the\nright way uh so I'm A Cloud developer\nAdvocate at Microsoft\num let's see should I remove some skills\nprogramming Linux Etc and projects Linux\nfor my resume to streamline and focus\nresume for help this job Kev what do you\nwhat advice you got for like a tailored\nresume for a help desk gig I'm gonna be\nhonest with you right now uh right now\nhelp desk they're asking for python in\nPowershell whoa\nyeah\nsome jobs are asking for that now and\nhelped us\nso just you're aware it's just for like\nthe scripting kind of scripting kind of\nthing yeah yeah you need you need to\nknow you need to know python or you may\nneed to know Powershell or or you may\nneed to know Linux now it's not like\nbefore it's very more like you're asking\nfor more stuff now\nnot just regular active directory are\nthey paying more though yes all right\ncool cool I like that I like that I like\nbecause the line between helped us since\nthis admin is like super it's like a\nsuch a gray area anyway\nbecause I feel I'll feel like a lot of\nlike\nhelp desk especially like you're saying\nin those higher tiers you're essentially\ndoing a lot of sysadmin stuff anyway\nand then when you when you're talking\nsysadmin you're talking you're talking\nlike you said scripting you know you got\nto automate some stuff you gotta got\nthat ad\num you got to have some you know bash\nexperience or like uh maybe Linux server\nexperience or whatnot so\nwow that's wild I don't know I I have to\ntake a look at like some like these\nthese uh\nmore recent help desk\nkind of job descriptions because that's\nwild yeah you'll see like you'll see\nlike active directory Office 365\num ssem for help desk\num Avanti\num software packaging\num northern ghosts\num pixie boot like setting up images and\nstuff like that yeah yeah\nuh you'll probably see dual or OCTA or\nRSA it really depends on the company\nyou'll see MDM as well mobile device\nmanagement with intunes or with mobile\niron or with Master 360 really depends\non the company so it's very like help\ndesk you gotta look at the job\ndescription because some of them pay a\nlot of money because they require all\nthese skills yeah and some of them just\nall they require is just active\ndirectory that's it and they don't pay a\nlot so yeah it really depends on the on\nthe job and job description yeah those\nones with like python Powershell better\nbe paying a good\ncloser to like a CIS admin kind of\nsalary because\nunless you know I mean also the thing\ncould happen where it's like oh suddenly\nall helped us just asks for that and\nthen they can just all lower the salary\nbecause like that kind of becomes a new\nindustry standard\nI don't know not saying that that's\ngonna happen but I hope not like I could\nsee like I don't know because businesses\ncan get greedy you know like yeah yeah\nyeah let me see what else here do you\nguys have a portfolio if so what kind of\nprojects do you have in it GitHub repo\nterraform scripts and whatnot so\nI wouldn't necessarily I don't I don't\nhave a portfolio I I have a GitHub\num and then in GitHub I have like I just\nI've I've I make all of my repos public\neven if I'm just starting to work on\nthem I will like it'll be public there\nas I'm building it or whatever if I\ndon't have absolutely everything it's\nstill there because so people who follow\nme or GitHub can like kind of watch what\nI'm working on\nbut ideally I like to get my repos in\nplaces where\nthere's some decent documentation\nthere's like a diagram and then there's\nlike some CI CD and whatnot\nthat's kind of like what I expect from a\nrepository\nbut if I need to do more or with like\nsomething different then I'll do it but\nyeah I GitHub is pretty much where I\npoint people to\nuh when it comes to like a project I\ndon't know about you Kev\nI I I just I use my uh\nI use my YouTube channel as my as my\nportfolioum and I have my website too so I have a\nwebsite too so that that's my portfolio\nright there my website showing what I\nactually but showing what I actually do\nbecause I\nI help like um like people like some\nmanagers even use my some managers even\nuse my YouTube videos to train their\nhelp desk too because I spoke with I\nspeak with different managers all the\ntime yeah and um yeah like I know I know\nsome of my stuff is working because I\nknow as people get jobs I see people get\ntraining with my videos I guess so\num let's just my portfolio is my website\nand what I do on YouTube yeah excuse me\nyeah I feel you we have I think because\nwe all sort of like in different roles\nit's like and that would go for anyone\nlike if depending on your role like what\nyour portfolio needs to look like would\nbe different like so for a web like a\nfront-end web developer like you better\nhave like a bunch of just like websites\nor like or or I don't know maybe\nsnapshots or websites or like a gallery\nor something like that because that's\nwhat people care about right\num\nand whatnot but if you're like maybe\nlike a back end or maybe you're like an\nart like a solution architect you'll you\nmight need a Blog more where you're just\nwriting about your Solutions and whatnot\num\nbut yeah so like it depends\nlet me see have you ever been asked to\ndo the need the needful what is thatdon't know what the need for sure that\nmeans\nuh\nuh hold on let me see what else we got\nhere\nby the way love the videos Kev I was\njust watching your video on ad and\nsetting it up I think I need to learn\nthat for what I want to do in my career\nA.D I feel like it all comes down to A.D\nsee I feel like we might uh all right we\ntalked about the current uh\nthe current\njob marketuh fixing things under pressure fixing\nit under pressure made that interview\neasyhave you used\npsychotic secret server\ndo you know what that is\nI know what that is I use that in my job\nokay talk to us about it because I have\nno idea it's secrets so we we have the\nCodex server set up with active\ndirectory and it syncs over the active\ndirectory so basically\num there's automation involved which I\ndon't do that but\num if you image a computer using sscm on\nin my environment it creates a local\naccount the local account comes from\ntacotic server so then when you if the\ncomputer error falls off the domain you\ngot to go to Taconic server log in with\ntwo-factor and then pick up the local\naccount that way so that's it's an\nactual server or a website that you go\nto where you store passwords on for for\nthings kind of like a cable that's cool\nyes interesting you go in there and you\nsaid you could you could you could\nactually download the app itself and you\ncould put it on an application as well\nand then open it up on your computer and\na lot of software developers use it in\nmy job because they have to they have to\nlike remote in or SSL to certain boxes\nand stuff like that\ncan you entertain a chat I gotta just\nbuzz the door I'll be right back yeah no\nworriesso hopefully that that answers your\nhopefully that answers your questions I\nhave used it before wasting your job to\nmake videos\nuh I'm not I know nothing about devops\nI'm gonna wait for her to come back for\nthat question anyone have any questions\nfor me I saw someone else had a question\nuh help desk once once python Powershell\nthey better cut that check I agree with\nyou\num what would be your advice to be what\nwould be your advice for a uni student\nwith two years left trying to get into\ncloud with already eight months you\nshould you should be you should build a\nhome lab for a cloud let me see anyone\nuh hi Mike\nhi Mikeuh how much do I make it's a good\nquestion\num\nyou're asking me how much do he's asking\nme how much do I make this funny do you\ntalk to you like do you talk salary or\nno\nI don't talk salary but I'll tell you I\ntalk to answer his question I make more\nthan 150k so yeah I um\nI don't have anything to talk about\nsalary uh but I know some people get\nweird about it oh then I saw someone I\nsaw someone say what isn't your job to\nmake videos is that to me or to Kev and\nI laughed at it on the other one I guess\nso that's what I say because to me it's\ndefinitely not like Prime now I do a lot\nI like\nbuild more so Azure products now than\nanything\nuh and then 50 is kind of like workshops\nand whatnot but I all the video stuff\nthat I do is\num the side\nuh outside of the outside of the road\nlet me see here\nI saw another question here I want his\nhands what made you want to stay and\nhelped us as a career because it's\nfrustrating that's a good questionman yeah yeah I love working with people\nI love I love Financial Services I love\nworking with people I love working with\nuh the guys that I work with I guess the\nexecutives I work with they're not\nthey're not a pain in the ass to deal\nwith they're actually they're the nicest\npeople I met in in my career like my\ncurrent job like everyone's super\nfriendly\num you're not allowed to scream at y'all\nwith someone otherwise you're gonna get\nin trouble by HR it's not like like\nbefore a long time ago it helped us it's\nnot the same thing now now it's like\nthey're actually covering they're\nactually protecting help desk people now\nit's not like before where you can't you\ncan't scream and yell at people you\ngotta get gonna get fired and and my\nother job the guy it was a guy was there\nwas a guy that screamed and yelled at me\nso I worked for a Japanese hedge fund\num and he he fought he he got fired\nbecause he screamed the yell at me HR\nfired the hell out of that guy so you\ncan't be screaming together you helped\nus to uh guys affiliate yeah I feel I\nlike there are some help desk gigs that\nI feel like it pay well and then you got\nkind of like the right structure going\non then that could be like a\nI could see that being like a like a\ncareer like a little bit more long term\nfor some people\num it just sucks that a lot of them\npeople I don't know I just feel like\npeople feel like they can take advantage\nof you because\nyou're supposed to fix things for them\nand I don't I just human beings human\nbeings are what make it suck\num let me see what else are here I can't\neven imagine that 100K life trying to\nhard to get there congrats\nlike the thing about money is\nif you don't take care of keeping your\nexpenses kind of in check like the more\nmoney you can make\nthey're more money you're like you're\nexpenses to go up so like then you're\ngonna have to be like oh I can't wait to\nhit 200k oh I can't wait to hit 300K and\nwhatnot so it's like I feel like you\ncould be making because I remember when\nI was making like 55k I was like oh I'm\nnever gonna ever need or like make need\nto make more money this because I'm set\nuh because you know I was you know\nsingle no kids and whatnot so like that\namount of money just for me I was just\nlike oh my goodness\nso I kind of kept that kind of same\nlifestyle and why not until I moved here\nto New York and like like I'm saying I'm\ntrying to get at it because it's way too\nexpensive uh but if it's like as I feel\nlike if you chase more so like\nfulfillment and career like the money\nwill come and if you're smart with your\nmoney like you kind of have like the\nperfect you got the perfect setup there\ntoo\nyeah with with me for me to answer that\nquestion with me is I grew up extremely\npoor so I'm I I I come from humble\nbeginnings so because of that mindset\nI'm always hungry I'm always hungry to\nmake more money that's just how my\nmindset works because but but I do care\nabout my I always talk about work life\nbalance so that you can make all the\nmoney in the world but if your work life\nbalance sucks I'm gonna run away from\nthat I want a good work-life balance\nthat pays I want a job that pays good\nbut also has a good work life balance\nbecause I don't want to be anybody\nmiserable I can make 500k and be\nmiserable doesn't make any sense yeah\nthat's that's definitely not worth it\nthat's yeah exactly and I feel that this\nis a good question here GPS how do I put\ncloud projects on my portfolio without\nracking up charges and if I need to have\nServices running constantly or snapshot\nwhat I make them shut down then talk\nabout them yeah you don't need to have\nprojects like you don't need to have\nlike an Instagram clone running on your\nservice 24 7 or any in your Azure\nsubscription what you need is you need\nto learn something right and for and in\norder for you to learn something you\ndon't necessarily have to have it\num running all the time but what I also\ntell people is like\nif you have to pay twenty thirty dollars\nin Cloud charges a month like in\nexchange to learn like is that not worth\nit if you're thinking like twenty thirty\ndollars a month down the road could be\nmaking you like a six-figure income like\nwas that not worth it so I feel like\npeople are scared but if you put in\nbudgets if you're really reading the\npricing which is also very important\nwhen it comes to like Cloud admin\nsolution architect type roles like if\nyou're understanding prices you're\nunderstanding upfront how much you may\nbe able to pay for this and if you're\nputting in that money then and you have\nlike a budget I don't know 50 a month or\nwhatnot\nI think it's worth it but there's also\nlike there's a lot of free tiers that\nyou can use there's a lot like a lot of\nservices now have serverless or\nconsumption based uh types of plans that\nyou can run things on so it's only as\nyou execute them you get charged there's\na lot of ways and also like Microsoft\nlearn has a lot of sandboxes on the last\nvideo that I made that's called you\nshould learn Linux it's basically a\nbunch of examples from Microsoft learn\nsandbox if you go and do it in the\nsandbox understand what's going on and\nthen just kind of like blog document\nright about build your skill set that\nway you can have 10 sandboxes of one\nhour every single day at microsoftware\nso many exercises you can go out and do\nthere there's plenty there's I don't\nthink there's really reasons for people\nto say like\nI can't get Hands-On because I don't\nwant to spend money because their\noptions are there\nbut don't be afraid to spend money to\neducate yourself like if you're not\ngonna go to school that means you're not\ngonna be racking up those like a crazy\nschool debt and you're not gonna go to\nboot camp and whatnot then putting in a\ncouple maybe a couple tens of dollars a\nmonth to learn it's worth it don't be\nafraid of it\nuh let's see here I was gonna say don't\nbe don't be afraid to invest money in\nyourself because the only One's Gonna\nPay like sometimes you have to invest\nmoney in yourself if you want to level\nup unfortunately that's just how it is\nwith some certain things\nyeah like I was about to say this but\nsomeone just said I find it silly when\npeople can easily spend 100 bucks on\ndinner drinks but have excuse they can't\nafford 100 course exactly like if you\nadd up all the subscriptions you got\nthat's probably close to 100 ish maybe\neven a little bit more\nuh and that would have been like you\nknow a couple of projects in Azure like\n20 in Azure a month will get you really\na long way like think of like the cloud\nresume challenge project that thing runs\nfor like less than a dollar a month like\nI've I've had that thing running for\nmaybe like two two maybe about two years\nnow maybe a year and a half and I think\nit's probably like 13 total so there's a\nlot of projects out there that you can\nrun for like long term and not be\nspending the amount of money that people\nthink I think just Twitter and like Tech\nsocial media does the disservice of\nmaking people believe that if you go\ninto the cloud you're gonna rack\nthousands and thousands and tens of\nthousands of dollars in bills it's like\nif you're careful you know what you're\ndoing which you're learning about this\nstuff anyway and putting budgets and\nwhatnot like you're gonna be fine you're\ngonna be fine\num let's see here\nlook looking to leave my job because of\nno work-life balance my company expects\n24 7 tech support oh my goodness this\nsucks 24. have you been on call Kev do\nyou do you have any Uncle stuff now\nyeah yeah I'm on call here I'm on call\nnot now but I'm gonna call everything\nevery couple weeks imagine you had to\ntake a ticket right now\nit's not that bad though here's not that\nbad\num I was gonna say um I I don't know if\nyou watch any of my other videos but I\nhave cloud videos so yeah I have some\ncloud videos\nwith with Ryan\num with Ryan O'Connell\nnot sure if you know who that guy is I\nmean if it's in\none of your cloud videos like you see in\nall of them\nyeah yeah then I guess I probably have\nyeah that's right it's Ryan o'connelly's\nis it MVP for Microsoft so I have videos\nwith him we made videos together on\ncloud stuff like budgeting creating a VM\nDash and stuff like that you know take\nadvantage of the free resources don't\npay anything right yeah there's plenty\nthere's plenty of free I would also\nencourage people to like look into\nuh a lot of cloud providers have these\nprograms while they're offered free\ncredits as well so like AWS Community\nBuilders uh in exchange for documenting\nyour learning and helping the community\nlike they have these programs that you\ncan be part of uh which I would\nrecommend people take take a look at\nuh well so I was gonna say something\nelse but I've totally forgot about this\nuh let me see here oh here's a good one\nask your employer if they offer access\nto learning platforms like udemy or\nplural site that was really cool about\nthe help desk gig too because they were\nthey would give you I think a thousand\ndollars a year for you to use what in\nwhatever you wanted in terms of\neducation book certification exams\ncourses anything like that and that's\njust something like they offered and I\nfeel like in a lot of help desk gigs\nthey kind of know that people are\nlooking to up skill so it's like a it's\nkind of like a like a perk that they\nwant to offer anyway\num to like stay competitive so it's\ndefinitely like one thing like if you\ncan learn on their dime you absolutely\nshould\ndefinitely absolutely don't buy any\nYouTube coursesdamn look at that hate uh I don't I want\nto do a course but man I don't know how\nyou find the time to do it so what what\ndo you so how much time are you spending\na day like working on your course what's\nthat look like\nuh the courses are already out on you\nDemi I'm gonna work on a new one I'm\ngonna start that probably next month\nyeah um because I'm busy right now so\nnext month I'm gonna work on that\num hopefully I get that going and then I\ngot invited to speak again so I gotta go\nI gotta I gotta go to Philly and talk\nI'm doing a presentation over there um\nmostly\num next year I go to Las Vegas and go to\nblack hat because they invited me to\nblack hat this year but I couldn't go it\nwas so busy that's cool I wanted a\nlittle black hat next year my hair it's\nactually it's free it was free for me so\nI had to pay anything but um it's\nbecause of LinkedIn because I use\nLinkedIn a lot because I socialize with\neverybody on LinkedIn so like that\nLinkedIn branding stuff\ndoes help me because I get a lot of free\nfree stuff I got invited for an event\nnext week I'm going to an event next\nweek so it's free for me so you know\ntake advantage of it if it's free you're\ngonna invite me to go get some steak and\nand some food man I'm gonna say yeahall right Matt we're gonna have to call\nthis one we've been doing this for like\nhour 20 uh we were kind of aiming for an\nhour but looks like we had a lot of\nquestions so we wanted to get to them\nbut thank you Kev appreciate it uh of\ncourse it's been absolute blast I gotta\nhave you on here again maybe we'll keep\ndoing this uh I don't know maybe\nonce a quarter or something like that\nwould be dope definitely well uh we'll\nbe in touch but yeah chat thanks for\nhanging out okay thanks for hanging out\nuh we'll be in touch soon\neveryone I'll see you next week peace\nout\nthere",
