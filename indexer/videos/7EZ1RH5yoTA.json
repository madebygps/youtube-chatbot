  "transcript": "so bash is a pretty important skill to\nhave when it comes to Cloud not only is\nit essentially a universal language when\nit comes to working with Linux servers\nbut it also integrates pretty well with\nother programming languages scripting\nlanguages command line tools and more\nthat you're going to use to work with\nyour cloud services let me give you an\nexample we got a bash script here and we\ncan right off the bat see we've got\nfunctionality from both bash and the\nAzure CLI so things like setting\nvariables using an if statement printing\nto screen with Echo are all bash\nfunctionality and then any commands that\nhave a prefix of AZ so this one and this\none right here are all functionality\nfrom the Azure CLI so you can see we're\nrunning two things in one script if I go\nand run this this is going to create a\nresource Group in Azure if it doesn't\nalready exist depending on the name\nwhich is assigned up here and if it does\nexist it's just going to print a screen\nthis group exists so you see it didn't\nprint that message to me it went out and\ncreated it for me and if I run it again\nit's just going to say this group exists",
