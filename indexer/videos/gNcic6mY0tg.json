  "transcript": "hi everyone welcome to another video in\nthe series where we are discussing how\nto get a cloud job in my previous video\nI had shared with you all this diagram\nif you want access to this diagram by\nthe way let me know if there's enough\ninterest I will some\nhow find a way to share it\nwith you all however it does take a lot\nof work so I don't know if giving it\naway for free\nfair but we'll see but anyway I shared\nthis journey or this timeline where\nultimately I can see someone going from\nprereqs so you've worked some sort of\nother role prior\nand you have either a degree you've\nattended a boot camp you have some sort\nof other technical work experience\nthough that's kind of an exception\nbecause you would skip this phase and go\nstraight to applying to your Cloud role\nor you have an entry level Tech role in\nthe self-taught framework which is for\nme two search two projects in one year\nentry level experience and then you can\ngo from that to a cloud exposure role\nand then a cloud job in anywhere from\ntwo years to four years\nin time I think it's very realistic very\npossibleand I found there was a lot of interest\nin understanding a little bit more about\nthis this role this phase here Cloud\nexposure what that looks like so it\nlooks like a lot of people either have\nsome sort of degree have attended a boot\ncamp have some sort of other uh sort of\nlike you're in an entry-level role and\nyou're self-teaching like how do you go\nfrom that and you you take the next step\ninto your into your potential Cloud job\nsomething like Cloud engineering Cloud\ndeveloper devops engineer so today we\nare going to talk about that\num hi my name is GPS I do Cloud things\nat Microsoft and here on YouTube\nplease give this video a like hit the\nSubscribe button leave a comment it\nreally does help not only in metrics but\nalso just it's encourage it's\nencouraging to know you all like the\nconcept and welcome to new video alright\nso\nback into this Cloud exposure phase here\nagain I think you can potentially spend\na year to two years to just probably\npushing it a year to year and a half\nyour solid your gold that coupled with\nyour past year to two years of\nexperience I'm pretty sure you're you're\nin terms of skill set and experience\nyou're not lacking it's more so if\nyou're getting rejected it's probably\nresume\ninterviewing skills not knowing not\nnetworking enough something like that\nbut yeah Cloud exposure but what I mean\nby Cloud exposure is it's your stepping\nZone it's these roles that don't\nnecessarily have\ncloud in them though I haven't included\nhere a column that are essentially roles\nthat have cloud like Cloud developer\nJunior Cloud developer Junior devops\nengineer Junior site reliability\nengineer Junior data engineer your Cloud\nadmin Junior Cloud security analyst\nJunior Cloud solution architect\nand these a lot of these have Cloud on\nthem and these are essentially the\njunior levels to the roles that you want\nto end up going to I think you are in\nyour in your right mind to go and apply\nwith uh to these roles here we'll talk\nabout this column in a second to these\nrule because\nyou know if you're doing the the\nself-taught framework you've got two\nsearch two projects one entry-level year\nof experience and most importantly\nyou've learned CLI a programming\nlanguage Cloud platform and devops on\nmentals\nso you have the skill sets you you have\nthe skill set it's more so this time\ntailoring your resume being able to\nspeak about your projects and applying\napplying applying applying applying\nprobably facing a lot of rejection which\nis why I include the cloud exposure\nphase instead of going straight from\nOnce completing prereqs straight to\nCloud\ncloud cloud job but you have the\nstepping Zone here\nbut I say 100 go for them as you apply\nfor these roles go and apply for these\nrules too because like I mentioned the\nformula to Landing a role is 100 it's 50\nyou're what you're in charge of your\nyour projects your skill set all those\ntypes of things and then 50 luck and one\nday there could be just 50 luck\navailable if you got 50 there's 50 luck\navailable right place right time\nopportunity boom 100 you you find\nyourself in your Junior devops engineer\nrole or something like that so go for\nthese right 100 go for these now on the\nleft side are more perhaps a little bit\nmore realistic when when luck is running\non the low\nand these are junior solution architect\nCloud migration Specialists Cloud sales\nrepresentative Cloud technical writer\nCloud customer success manager cloud\ntraining specialist and Cloud support\nspecialist\nI got these by asking chat gbt a bunch\nof questions in terms of like what are\nthe most popular roles out there that\ndon't necessarily aren't necessarily\nCloud engineering roles but will give me\nexposure to cloud computing Technologies\nand it gave me these here\nand I think they're actually pretty good\nso we're going to talk about these one\nby one I actually might group some of\nthese so let's start first with\nthe junior solution architect and the\ncloud sales representative because these\nare very\nsales based and focused roles\nand you could potentially make full-on\ncareers\nby being in these Cloud exposure roles I\nthink one thing I I've seen people sort\nof get confused about is I see people\nwho have a background perhaps business\nor in sales they're very charismatic\nthey love having that sales type\ninteraction with people and they think\nthat\nthere's no place for that in cloud\ncomputing but tech technical sales\nsolution architect type roles which you\nyou know your commission based so you\ndip your your salary will depend on your\ncommission can be very very lucrative I\nhave spoken to many many people at\nMicrosoft who have these types of roles\nand the commissions that they make are\ninsane now remember there's one very\nspecific interaction with someone I met\nlast summer we were at like a happy hour\nthing and I was just like oh my goodness\nI am in the wrong field so if you're\nsomeone with a sales or business\nbackground there's pla there are plenty\nof two opportunities here but\nI will also say that maybe you you\nfind yourself applying to these roles\nbut you don't want to end up being this\nfor\nlike the next couple of years or\nwhatever your end goal role is\ndon't think that the experience that you\ngain here won't be something that you\ncan apply to your next role absolutely\nbecause solution Architects sales uh\nsales representatives you have to know\nthe product that you're selling\nobviously you have to be able to speak\nto it and you have to be able to speak\nto it in a way that is\nfriendly to people who are perhaps\nnon-technical\nwhich in my opinion is a skill set that\nyou will use for the rest of your life\nand something that gets developed in\nlike the the earlier you develop it the\nbetter you'll be and there's also\nanother reason why I highly recommend\nsupport role as People's First roles\nbecause you develop people skills your\ncommunication skills there and that's\nsomething that you will take to the rest\nof your career right so yeah you you\nhave to be able to speak to what you're\nyou're selling you can't just be like oh\nyou should purchase this cloud service\nand they're going to ask well what about\nthis other one then you're like oh I\ndon't know like and they ask you what\nare the difference and you're like oh I\ndon't know you can't do that right so\nsales types sales based rules great ones\nfor cloud exposure\nthen Cloud migration special I should\nhave grouped these actually you know\nwhat we're going to group these right\nnow we're going to do this because this\nis going to make a little bit more sense\nhere if we group this this here and then\nthis and then this and then this and\nthen we put these\nso we'll\nput these together\nand then we can make a little bit more\nsense of what all these mean because you\ndevelop sort of different skill sets but\nall very very very very applicable to\nthat next step so we're going to call\nthese sales based\nsales based\nthis is way too too large okay and we'll\njust make this another color here sales\nbased\nthen we're gonna do content based\nand then here we're gonna put these\nsupport based\nokay\nsee I I continue improving this diagram\nall the time whoops we're gonna move\nthis slower here over here\nand we could probably make these just a\nlittle\nother very pretty small Okay cool so we\ntalked about the sales based ones\nnow let's talk about let's talk about\nthe content-based ones first\nso I totally forgot that my previous\nrole I don't know why is content based I\nactually worked at a cloud Guru before\nworking at Microsoft so after I left my\nmy cloud engineering role\nI worked at a cloud Guru and I was an\nassociate Community trading architect my\ngoal was to essentially create content\naround the things that I had learned in\nmy previous roles as a cloud engineer as\nas admin in my help desk scroll and it\nwas very lucrative in my opinion I was\nmaking 92\n000 USD\n92 that's a very very close to six\nfigures that's the most amount of money\nthat I ever thought I would make and\nactually the one before that when I made\n75 000 USD that was the most amount of\nmoney I ever thought I made but then you\nknow I I made this jump to 92k and I was\nlike I had no idea that content-based\nrules could be so lucrative and it makes\nsense because\nyou know all these professionals who are\nworking in Tech they need to learn\nsomehow\nand\nif you are good at teaching if you have\na background maybe you are a teacher now\nmaybe you're a tutor maybe you like\nteaching maybe you've done some training\ntype work and you know you know how\ndifficult it is to teach however if\nthat's a skill set that you want to\nleverage and you can also make this a\nvery lucrative career like again if you\ndon't want to go Cloud engineer you\ndon't want to go devops engineer but you\nthink that's your only path I'm here to\ntell you no you can leverage your skill\nset with your teaching skill set to go\nand be in a cloud technical writer where\nyou're creating documentation you're\ncreating support articles for some sort\nof cloud based service or Cloud platform\nyou can be a cloud training specialist\nteach other people things like\ncertification content or Labs or like a\nbunch of other things like that too and\nyou're also\nit's a role where you're going to be\nteaching yourself a lot and very well\nbecause you're going to go and have to\nteach the content in order for your your\nroom\nyour content to be or your platform that\nyou teach on to be rated very well like\nyou have to have a good approach a good\nteaching approach right\nso technical writer cloud training\nspecialist you get Hands-On with all\nthese Services because again maybe you\nhave to create demos or you have to\ncreate uh screen recordings or something\nlike that but also great great rules for\ncloud exposure and again like I\nmentioned very lucrative and clubs like\nsupport based so when we think of help\nthat support at that prereq level this\nis very similar to that where you're\nfocusing on ticketing systems you're\nfocusing on documentation\ntroubleshooting and then you're also\nfocused on what's the uh ticketing\nsystems documentation troubleshooting\nand how did I I always forget these\nuh people skills people skills because\nyou're talking obviously you're\nresolving people's skills by talking\nwith them right you're resolving\npeople's issues by talking with them but\nthis is in the context of cloud so I put\nhere Cloud migration Specialists Cloud\ncustomer success manager and Cloud\nsupport specialist\nnow these you are\nyou're potentially working at like these\nlarge companies like Accenture\nor what's the other one I think it's\nDeloitte where they have just thousands\nand thousands of people in teams\nlike put into teams are you working with\nother external customers perhaps you're\nyou're helping them like for example\nCloud migration Specialists you might\nhave a little bit more of uh a sales\nsales Focus not necessarily sales Focus\nbut initial phone call Focus\nwhere you're put on to figure out like\nsome Basics about what's going to happen\nin the project what needs to happen in\nthe project and then it's passed on to\nsomeone more senior Cloud customer\nsuccess manager you might be on a\ncompany that has some sort of\ncloud-based product and your job is to\nwork with customers with whatever issue\nthey're having or you're a cloud support\nspecialist you are again\nresolving issues that customers are\nhaving with your Cloud product right\nagain it's support based but you're\ngetting Hands-On with whatever that\ncloud product is because you you have to\nget Hands-On in order to fix whatever\nissue people are having so support based\nso these are three areas that I feel\nlike can give you a lot a lot of\nexposure and to moving into your Cloud\nrole again a year to two years into this\nI obviously you're building stuff you\ncould potentially take it to the next\nstep with the self-taught framework and\nget like a professional level\ncertification or another complimentary\ncertification and ideally you would\nbuild another project or improve the\nproject that you built in this space\nhere and you're writing about it you're\ntalking about it and you're improving\nyour time here a year to two years and\nthen go apply to your Cloud job Cloud\nengineer Cloud developer devops SRE\nsecurity whatever it is that you want to\ndo the last thing I wanted to add is in\nthe previous video we talked about\nentering skills resume cover letter and\nLinkedin but I added here under the\nadditional things to better chances at\nall stages which is participate in\ncommunities and outside of already\ncreating your content and learning in\npublic if you can give talks that's\nawesome I've gone on any topic that you\nwant to there are tons of meetups out\nthere that you can attend and you can\nalso give talks at and maybe you could\npotentially organize one I think that's\nawesome too\ncontribute to open source if you want to\ncontribute to learn a cloud what you can\ndo is you know go to learn to\ncloud.guide and here at our home page\nwhat we do is display a random Cloud\ndefinition that was submitted by people\nin the community\nfor example Jenkins this is an article\nto learn more about Jenkins here's the\ndefinition this person has submitted and\na summon is the author of this\ndefinition here and here this actually\nlinks to whatever link you want to add\nthere you can submit a definition\ndefinition by hitting submit a\ndefinition click on submit a cloud to\nfinish and get started and then you need\nto provide fill in this Json with your\nword I personally go one by one and sort\nof Coach people through or if if they\ndon't need any help then they just\nsubmit it and then I\nuh you know approve the the submission\nbut those are ways that you can\ncontribute to open source there you can\nalso fix or improve the documentation\nthat you see out there that's open\nsource perhaps there are other first\ncontributor friendly issues out there\nthat you can find on on GitHub or an\nopen source in general highly recommend\nyou participate in that and put yourself\nout there get to get to know people\nparticipating in panels in in just other\nevents I think is a great idea\nI always like to tell the story of my I\napplied to Microsoft three times the\nfirst time I was directed automatically\nthe second time as well and the third\ntime I had two referrals and I also\nhappened to know the hiring manager but\nI didn't know that I knew the hiring\nmanager what happened was I was part of\nthe Microsoft MVP program which I highly\nrecommend people look into an ambassador\ntype programs GitHub has them Microsoft\nhas them AWS has them it just improves\nyour way of networking and meeting other\npeople who work at these companies that\nyou may want to end up working at so as\npart of that program and I was asked to\nbe on this panel and it was a couple of\nmonths before I ended up applying for\nthe third time to Microsoft\nand I one of the people on that panel\nended up being the hiring manager so\nwhen I applied to the role and the\nperson who referred me told me all the\nhiring manager's name is this I was like\nthat sounds so familiar I look back at\nthe invitation to that panel and saw\nthat this person's name was on there I\nwas like this is so amazing what a\ncoincidence but also like I mentioned\nLanding a role 100 50 in your control 50\nluck and this happened to be just that\nlock percentage for me just happened to\nbe up here\nso when we had our initial conversation\non the role\nthey were they were clearly like oh\nwe've we've spoken before we yeah we\nwere on that event so there was instant\nRapport there because he had already\nknown why it was and it was all because\nI decided to participate in this panel\nwell I got an invitation of course but I\nhad been out there public publicly and\npeople had known my name and they were\nlike oh yeah I think she would be great\nfor this and it worked out to my favor\nright put yourself out there again\nremember the rules they'll be fake\nthey'll be annoying don't let it consume\nyou but leverage it learn how to\nleverage these types of things all right\nthat's it for this video another long\none but I hope I provide a little bit\nmore insight into what I mean by Cloud\nexposure type roles if there are any\nkind of areas of this journey you want\nme to cover uh perhaps you want to learn\na little bit more about like oh you're\nnot even cover the prereqs like you're\nworking in a different field how to go\nthrough that prereq phase let me know or\nI don't know any kind of topic around\nthis\num yeah I will see you in the next video\npeace",
