  "transcript": "I've got a six-month self-study boot\ncamp that you can use to learn the\nskills to become a cloud engineer Cloud\nsupport Cloud admin an entry-level Cloud\nrole with a focus on engineering so if\nyou're interested in sales or any other\nspace of cloud this isn't really what\nyou're looking for uh but if you are\ntake a look hi my name is GPS and\nwelcome to a new video\nall right you're gonna go to\nbootcamp.madebygps.com to start off this\nis a much more concise and\nstraightforward and meant to be used as\na reference of what learn to cloud is\nwhere I Surrender cloud is a overall\nguide that you probably have to go in\nand out often this is something that you\ncan just check on a daily basis a weekly\nthing because I know learn to Cloud can\nbe a little overwhelming when you're\ntrying to just have maybe like a high\nlevel guide or a high level outline of\nwhat you need to follow right so the\nprotocol will be to three to four hours\na day at the minimum keep a study\nJournal this is a place for you to\nreflect at the end of your study time\nevery single day spend five to ten\nminutes just writing what was\nchallenging\nwhat you really liked resources you\nreally liked and overall what you want\nto follow tomorrow because this is\nreally what's going to glue together uh\neverything and help you like\nhave like a a train of thought that you\ncan continue on the next day because\nremember you're going to be learning on\nyour free time right maybe you have a\nbunch of other responsibilities and it's\ngoing to be hard for you to remember\neverything but if you have sort of like\nyour train of thought in your Journal\nthen the next day you can start you're\nyou're studying by just referencing your\nJournal like oh this is where I was at\noh yeah I remember this and then you\ncontinue doing that too\nyou're going to end each section with a\nproject the difficulty of projects\ndoesn't necessarily matter more than\njust overall that you can showcase\nClarity and understanding of the skills\nthat you'll be learning make sure to put\non GitHub and then all Cloud platforms\nhave free credits when you sign up so\ntake advantage of that to make some of\nthese projects live as well and then and\neach project with documentation so this\nis why I recommend you have a journal\nbecause you can just go through your\ndaily uh journal entries and then from\nhere you can sort of grab everything and\ncreate like a blog post or create a\ntutorial on like YouTube or somewhere\nbut the journal is going to really help\nyou develop your own ability to\ncommunicate technical things with your\nown voice your own style your\nauthenticity your own realness because\nthose things really help when it comes\nto developing confidence for an\ninterview so I highly highly recommend\nyou and each project with documentation\nand I factored in three days at the end\nof each section for you to do this so\ntake advantage of the time and overall\ninstructions for the project are for the\nboot camp is create a free account in\nany Cloud platform AWS Azure or gcp I\ndon't care any one of those set up a\nlearning budget in your cloud account 20\nI think for each month is more than\nenough and make sure to set up alerts at\n50 and then 75 percent\nand then uh this these are alerts that\nwill tell you oh you've consumed 50 of\nyour budget oh you've consumed 75 and\nthese will just help you not go over\nbudget make sure to delete things when\nyou're done using them too create a blog\nor YouTube channel to document your\nlearning don't get too worried about\nyour branding you don't need fancy\nstyling none of that just go create a\nchannel or go create your blog or\nwherever it is that you want to document\nthese things\nand then create a GitHub account you'll\nneed these to upload your projects onto\nokay so we're going to kick things off\nwith a study plan with bash bash is what\nyou'll use to interact with your servers\nvia CLI via commands and this is one of\nthe most effective productive and\nefficient ways of interacting with a\ncloud platform and you should be doing\nthis as soon as possible I know\nbeginners tend to use the UI a lot but\nif you're going to play a VM it's\nprobably going to take you anywhere from\nfive to six minutes using the UI\nstepping through each step whereas with\na CLI command you could do that in 30\nseconds there's a bunch of resources\nhere\nand like I mentioned these will build\noff learn to Cloud so if we click on\nlike the First Resource here it just\nbrings you the Linux bash Network\nfundamentals it gives you resources\nprojects commands you should be familiar\nwith uh maybe certifications that you\nmight be interested in but again the\nstudy plan the boot camp plan is more so\njust a high level outline so you can\nreference it as often as you'd like all\nright we're going to divide these two\nweeks into 10 days of studying and\nworking within that Ubuntu VM so go into\nyour Cloud account to play the cheapest\npossible Ubuntu VM and then this is what\nyou're going to use to learn remember to\nturn it off after you're done and also\nconfigure it to automatically turn off\nat a certain hour like maybe you're\nalways done studying by 11 pm have it\nturn off at 11 PM\nin case you do forget also this is just\nso we don't spend more money than\nnecessary\nso 10 days working inside of that Ubuntu\nVM and just using the resources to learn\ndifferent types of commands and then\nfour days writing scripts I recommend\nyou do both of them but if you don't\nhave enough time\nthen do one of them probably the first\none is sort of the most bang for your\nbuck and then again three days at the\nend of each section to document your\nlearning and I stopped repeating this in\nevery single one of them but you get the\ngist of it three days are factored into\nthe six months so keep that in mind\nnext we're going to networking uh how\nall the machines talk to each other so\nit's a plumbing of the cloud right\nyou're gonna spend two weeks this is\nmore of a theoretical section there\naren't any Hands-On aspects to this\nbesides you know spending 10 days just\nlearning networking Concepts subnets\nv-nets again if you click on here and\nthen you scroll down to the networking\nsection it's going to tell you sort of\nConcepts that you should be familiar\nwith\nand in terms of the project I spent four\ndays here but just create a\nwell-documented network\narchitecture diagram and become familiar\nwith diagramming tools because these are\nsome tools that you're going to be using\nfor the rest of your career I recommend\ngoing to the architecture centers of the\ncloud that you're working in and then\njust find a two-tier and three-tier\narchitecture and be able to recreate\nthat from scratch but also be able to\nspeak through it saying like oh we have\nhere a three-tier architecture we have a\nsubnet hero we have the the this route\ntable here and you know be able to speak\nto the architecture and we're going to\nuse this in the following sections as\nwell\nnext we're going to go into python we're\ngoing to spend five weeks in this\nsection here python is just the one of\nthe most beginner friendly languages\nwhen it comes to Cloud there's so much\ncommunity so much content I highly\nrecommend it yeah well I'm not\npersonally a python developer I can\nremove my bias and say when it becomes\ncomes to Cloud beginners it's probably\none of the best options\nuh you should have already been\nintroduced to variables loops and just\nmore programming Concepts in The Bash\nsection but here we're going to dive\nfurther into this so so spend four weeks\nwith your favorite python resource again\nI have this learner Cloud link here and\nI have a bunch of them listed here\num\nand I'm probably going to add another\none because I know I found uh a python\nplaylist that was fantastic uh but yeah\nand that's been one week building a\nproject uh ability to do app API and\ndeploy I highly recommend doing both of\nthese uh to do app API so you don't need\na graphical part to this just the back\nend and deploy it to your Azure AWS or\ngcp account\nand then create a two-tier or three-tier\napplication architecture that you can\ndeploy to your cloud account so that\narchitecture that you created over here\njust go and use the python SDK for your\ncloud and deploy it to your account\nnext we're going to go to our uh Cloud\nsection and you have picked a cloud at\nthis point you've already introduced it\nfrom the very beginning and now it's\ntime to dive deeper you're going to\nspend four weeks studying for an\nassociate level certification this could\nbe the solution architect associate the\ndeveloper associate that you have in AWS\nor you can go to the az104 az204 which\nare associate level certifications for\nAzure I don't know the gcp ones but I'm\nsure they have them but spends four\nweeks studying for those and then two\nweeks building the cloud resume\nchallenge or any Cloud project I highly\nhighly recommend the cloud resume\nchallenge it's just it's just one of the\nbest projects when it comes to learning\ncloud I have a bunch of other projects\nif you go to resources on learn the\ncloud and there's you know Pig your\nCloud here pick whatever one you really\nwant but honestly the best bang for your\nbuck is going to be the cloud resume\nchallenge\nthen we move on to terraform uh starting\nfrom step four all the projects and sort\nof Hands-On are going to be just\nimplementing uh additional features from\nyour previous projects because a lot of\nthese are all devops practices and\ndevelops is all about making your\nexisting projects more efficient so you\ndon't have to build anything from\nscratch it's more so implementing\nfeatures to your already existing\nprojects right so for example we're\ngoing to start with terraform which is\nprobably the most popular infrastructure\ns code tool again resource here but you\ncan spend one week overall just studying\nterraform to Concepts uh the language is\nthat you'll need to use in those types\nof things and then one week building the\ninfrastructure as code files for any of\nyour previous projects so build it for\nyour Cloud resume challenge build it for\nyour or is it for your to-do app or if\nyou're a two-tier or three-tier\napplication architecture\nuh spend that time doing that then we\nmove on to Docker uh you're gonna spend\ntwo weeks one week uh studying Docker\noverall just Concepts and then one week\ncontainerizing any of your previous\nprojects probably makes the most sense\nto do something like a to-do app API you\ncould also do your Cloud resume if you\nwanted to\nand then GitHub actions you most likely\nget an introduction to cicd with your\nCloud resume challenge project so I\nwould take the time to spend one week uh\ntwo weeks total but one week just\noverall\nfurther diving into what cicd with\nGitHub actions is and then one week\nbuilding cacd for any of your other\nprevious other projects your Cloud\nresume will most likely have that\nbecause I believe it's part of the\nchallenge but just do it for I don't\nknow your to-do app or your two-tier or\nthree-tier application architecture as\nwell and that's pretty much the the\noutline I feel like this is something\nyou can say you can reference this often\nagain you can duplicate this to your\nNotions you can remove add things as\nneeded but uh yeah I hope this is\nhelpful and I hope you have a fantastic\n20 23.",
