  "transcript": "thank you all for asking me these career\nquestions\nit makes creating videos a lot more\nsustainable because i can fit them\nthroughout my day a lot easier\nthan the very technical\nfocused tutorials and it's a nice mix\nwith all that being said hi i'm gps and\nwelcome to a new video\nin terms of networking certifications\nthat you need for cloud\nthere aren't really any and that's\nbecause\na lot of the networking certifications\nthat exist\nthe more popular ones network plus\nccna\ncertifications of that nature\nare very very network engineer focused\nand in the context of a ccna they're\ncisco focused\nnot to say that they're not useful\nbut when it comes to landing a role in\ncloud\nespecially at the beginner level when\nwe're thinking like cloud admin cloud\nsupport\nuh cloud analyst whatever it might be\nwhatever\nrole entry level role it is\nit's more about understanding your\nfundamentals in terms of like how do you\ncreate a vpc or a v-net how do you\nsegment that into subnets how do you\nsecure it using acls network security\ngroups\nhow to make sure you have the right\ntraffic flow how to troubleshoot when\nsomething isn't flowing the right way\nthings like that\nwhen it comes to these networking\nspecific certifications you're going to\nlearn a lot more because they're\ntailored to network engineers and yes\nthere is cloud networking which is a\nspecialty very lucrative very high in\ndemand and if you're interested in\nnetworking already or already do\nnetworking\nhighly highly recommend you sort of\nbring your skills your networking skills\ninto cloud and you can potentially make\na lot of money and very in demand right\nbut as a beginner\nthat much\nlike expertise isn't necessary and i\nknow you know i hear people is telling\nme all the time that studying for ccna\ntakes them months and months and i've\neven heard years for some people they've\nrequired years of experience plus\nstudying things like that right\nand for a cloud beginner it's just not\nnecessary\nkeep in mind that a lot of these\nservices in cloud and this is for every\nsingle platform\nthey're they aim to abstract security\nthe aim to abstract networking all these\nthings so you can simply focus on your\nbusiness logic and this is good of\ncourse because you save time and when it\ncomes to the context of a company saving\ntime means saving money but when it\ncomes to troubleshooting or building\ncustom solutions understanding the\nnitty-gritty of securing and networking\nis going to help you\nbecause not having that level of\nabstraction\nmeans you got to figure it out on your\nown\nbut there are sort of more and more\nservices that come out all the time that\nwill abstract this for you and it kind\nof makes it feel like oh do i really\nneed networking or secure or security in\nthe first place it's like well yes you\nneed an unders to understand the\nfundamentals\nbecause\nthere's going to be a day where it's\nlike why is this not working and if you\ndidn't know how to find the answer it'd\nbe a lot easier than you trying to\nfigure it out from like scratch right\nuh i'm currently\nupskilling myself and working i'm\nfollowing a lot of the az i think it's\nthe 700\nor 500 i can't remember but they have uh\nin azure a lot of the certifications\nhave learning paths it's like\npre-content on microsoft learn that you\ncan just learn about these things\ni'll probably throw up a screenshot or\nsomething like that uh i'm following you\nthat because i'm planning to do a\nseries with my good friend liam he's a\ncolleague\nwho actually has a network engineering\nbackground and he's also a go developer\nso if you're interested in those kinds\nof things\nhe's also very skilled in devops and\ncloud native\ni'll make sure to link bam somewhere but\nwe're going to put together a nice\nseries for april\nall around deploying a network\ninfrastructure into azure with bicep so\ni have to upskill myself right but how i\nhad more of a networking foundation when\ni came into cloud it would have been a\nlot easier right\num but yeah that's my recommendation in\nterms of networking certifications you\ndon't really need ccna network plus none\nof these to get into cloud\nbut the sort of basic foundation of\nnetworking that you will be exposed to\nin every associate level certification\nthat you go out take for cloud will be\nmore than enough just make sure you\nreally really learn whatever it is that\nthey're asking you\ni know when i when\ni studied for something like even the\naz900 like you have aspects of\nnetworking in there something like the\naz104 will also have that for you when i\nstudied for my aws certified developer\nassociate there was networking aspects\nthere too\nso make sure you take the time to fully\nfully understand\nthe networking aspects that are\nintroduced to you in when you're setting\nfor your cloud certifications but having\na network specific certification\nisn't required isn't necessary\nto be honest no certifications are\nrequired but when you're getting started\nthey do help all right all right\nthat's it for this video feel free to\nask me more questions because i am\nloving answering them and i will see you\nin the next one",
