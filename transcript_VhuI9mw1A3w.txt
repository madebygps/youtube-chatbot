Which programming language you need to learn | Cloud Engineerto answer this question the how much
code do i need to learn to get into
cloud computing
your best bet is actually for any
technology that you want to learn to get
into cloud computing
your best bet is to hop on linkedin jobs
zip recruiter
uh indeed things like that look
up cloud engineer set it to entry level
if the website allows you to
and take a look at these the listings
and let's see what they ask you
i'm gonna do it for myself i'm going to
set it to cloud engineer new york
entry level and full time you might be
interested in contracts or internships
and things like that
it's totally up to you but i'm going to
take a look at this so let's happen to
indeed
and let's take a look at what these
listings are asking us
i'm gonna try to stick to the ones that
actually have cloud in the
role uh sales commerce new cloud
security engineer all right so let's
scroll down here
and right off the bat it is asking a
scripting experience in python in our
bash
so keep a note of that uh so let's
scroll down
into another one uh aws cloud developer
sort of we need experience with python
right
up right there right at the top of the
description okay
and let's scroll down to cloud
infrastructure engineer
this is very very long uh do i see any
languages being mentioned off the topoh here python there we go systems
engineer not really
again i'm sticking to the ones that say
cloud though
there aren't many cloud engineer entry
level gigs from what i
am looking at here junior cloud network
engineer
three to five uh years experience
no no programming
here public
experience okay here it's asking for
azure experienceterraform okay terraform scripting okayso i uh terraform really isn't
programming uh it's smart infrastructure
as code
but i guess if you're focused in on like
the devops aspect of things
then terraform would be a solid option
here's another cloud engineer one
python bash and python is asked for in
this one
so another point for that one let's
scroll into this cloud
software engineer uh python again
uh i want the ones that just say cloudcloud infrastructure engineer let's take
a look herepython again software nopeall right let's go into indeed uh cloud
engineer
let's scroll to requirementuh there we go python bash mentioned yet
againuh basic dev skills is a plus but what
does that mean
what does that mean all right uh
let's scroll into did we click on this
one yes we did associate cloud engineer
this one is asking for i see a lot of
help desk and azure so i would be
surprised if it didn't ask for some
powershellno hey here we go scripting powershell
the real advice here is
go into these job listing sites look for
cloud engineer
or the cloud that you're interested in
and then make a note of the languages
that they're asking for you
in those listings which are probably
either going to be
bash python powershell
because scripting is very important
because at the end of the day
the cloud is just linux servers
all right see you later
