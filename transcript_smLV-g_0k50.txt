Why and How I'm learning Linuxlet me ask you a question that you might
actually get at a technical interview
uh not this specific question but maybe
something along the lines of
i have a file and it has multiple lines
and each line has
this specific word that occurs multiple
times
how would you go about replacing only
the second
or the nth occurrence of the
word second third fourth whatever it is
if you asked me this a couple of months
ago i probably would have said something
along the lines of i would create a
console application that would
parse the content of the file and then
manipulate it that way
but now after discovering the power of
the command line
i would say that i would use the stream
editor command or the sed command
or the sed command some the thing about
linux is everything has like multiple
pronunciations and they're all correct
somehow like butter fs or better file
system or
better fs yeah um i'll
show you how to use that command and to
accomplish that task at the end of this
video with that being said hi i'm gps
and welcome to a new videolet me start with the why like most of
us we learn things
because it'll make us better at work or
it's required for work or whatever work
you know let's just say work i knew when
i started my role at acg
i was going to be working on linux
related projects and i simply didn't
feel comfortable enough
with my at that time skill set
of linux to work on any of the projects
so
sat down with my manager and we flushed
it out
and i decided that i'm going to take a
certification within
a certain amount of time the first
attempt at certification i actually
failed i made a video on that
um and then i took it a second time and
i passed
i always felt reluctant to learn linux
because for some reason
out of everything in tech it's that one
space where i feel like i definitely
don't belong
i don't know why it is maybe it's
because of my lack of experience or i
don't know the right tools or
or i'm not sure what it is and now that
i've actually
dipped my toes in in the space i've
realized that it's a foolish mindset to
have um i'm quite
intrigued and slightly in a healthy way
obsessed
with uh the linux and and i actually
have
popo s which is an ubuntu base
distribution
on my desktop and i've been using it as
my main operating system
for a couple of weeks now and i know
people are going to hop in the comments
now and say you should be using this
distro or you should be using that
distro
hey i'm going to give a bunch of distros
a try just not right now i'm trying to
just get comfortable right now
but yeah in this open source space and
me
having the mission to make you know
technology and
technical education more accessible and
less daunting to everyone
becoming more familiar and learning
about things like linux and open source
seems right up my alley
so i'm glad i'm doing it now let me talk
about the how
i have no shame in saying that when i'm
learning something new i need
a variety and lots of
learning material and that's videos
that's text
that could be like books or i don't know
some documentation
and obviously hands-on disclaimer
as most of you probably know by now i
work at a club guru
so that means i have full access to our
entire catalog and we have
multiple linux courses so that helped me
a lot
i watched the linux essentials course
and the lpi 101 which is
sort of a step above it but what i like
is that i can
grab some kind of lesson and if i
need like another type of explanation or
i want to watch
a different explanation on it i can go
to another course and see if it covers
that topic
sometimes with certifications they have
overlap
and you know topics will be covered in
both of them but they might be explained
in different ways or different contexts
so i like that in terms of books i have
two this one is the command
line well the linux command line it's
sort of like
every command well not every but the
majority of commands that you could
possibly need to use is probably in this
book
and what's great about it is it gives
you
the explanation and it gives you like
most popular arguments
that you could use and it also gives you
kind of like a
an exercise to do or like a playground
exercise i think that's what they call
it
yeah so i just go in here so i'll watch
a lesson and then whatever command the
lesson is on or whatever kind of task
the lesson is doing
i'll hop into this book and i'll find it
right and then i'll
do literally copy out the
samples and then just run through
so by then i'll have like multiple
examples because i'll do the examples
from the course
then i'll do the examples from this book
and then i'll keep going
another book that i use is this one
called
linux basics for hackers by no means do
i want to become a hacker
though security is a very interesting
topic and also something that i'd like
to explore but maybe next year
because i'm just overwhelmed this year
but this is great because it teaches you
a lot of
different tasks but it gives you it
teaches you those tasks in like
the context of a hacker
so it's very hands-on like for example
you use
things like or you learn things like
using and abusing services and
i know there's uh like chapter on bash
scripting
and uh one that i really really enjoyed
that
um i got a lot of benefit was this
controlling file and directory
permissions
permissions was something that i had to
go over many many times like watch the
videos again
read the linux command line book again
and then read the security book again
until it finally got in here i was able
to get hands-on enough
to really explore the commands that
you're expected to know for the linux
essentials certification
luckily the command line is something
that's pretty easy to get hands-on
because it's not like hey you need a
website to play around with or to deploy
in azure to
play around with some service you really
just need a command and some kind of
task
whether that's editing or modifying
permissions or
you know bash scripting or moving files
around renaming all that kind of stuff
right
i just summarized what i learned i'd
spend an hour in the morning just kind
of going through the theory
and watching the different material and
then i would let the day go like get my
work done
and towards the end of the day i spent
another hour
getting hands-on and then writing the
notes so by no means
am i a linux expert but i'm like
five percent ahead of where i was before
and that's progress
right next steps for me i'm studying for
my next cert
which is the linux foundation certified
sysadmin
and here's when people are going to come
in why aren't you studying for the red
hat cert
look the red hat is great i simply don't
need the recognition
that the red hat cert gives you and i
like the fact that the linux foundation
one is distro agnostic
plus they have a lot of overlap so if i
study for one i probably just have to
fill in the gaps
and i'll be able to take the other one
alongside that i'm doing a lot more
hands-on things
like i deployed a ghost block to an
ubuntu server on azure
the next thing i want to do is deploy a
next cloud server
also probably an azure and azure because
i'm most comfortable and i have a lot of
credits there
um yeah if you're not familiar with
nexcloud it's an open source alternative
to something like g suite or
office 3605 and like i mentioned at the
beginning this world of open source
has so many things going on um
i'm also in the process of finding all
the tools that i use in my workflow and
and finding open source alternatives
for them because it looks like open
source projects tend to respect
privacy a lot more right and i'm willing
to
support something like that even if i
have to pay for it
because i think those things matter yeah
so overall
i feel a lot more comfortable in the
command line and i think that's a win
especially in any kind of technical role
it's just crucial to understand what's
going on the command line yeah and
that's it for this video
i do want to give a shout out to a
couple of friends of mine elf
richard and parveen they joined me on a
stream last thursday and we just talked
about
anything anything really um we all
happen to work in cloud related roles so
it was kind of nice to just sit down and
talk to friends about
you know working in cloud i want to do
those more often
i'm still trying to figure out what's
the best time i did put a poll in the
community tab
so go check that out if you're
interested in that and i'd love to have
like a bunch of
different friends and and maybe even
strangers as long as you're respectful
to hop on stream and then we can just
chat yes
and all right now this is the end of the
video
i will see in the next video but if you
made it this far i'm going to show you
how to use that command
alrighty so let's display the file it's
a
text file and you see we have gwen gps
gwen gps gps
going gps gps gps alrighty so how can we
only replace the second occurrence of
gps with gwyneth
on every single line well let's use the
stream editor command
so it'll be said and then s for
substitute
and then we'll first type in the word
that we're looking for gps then we're
typing in what we're going to replace it
with
and then we're going to tell the command
which occurrence we want to
replace so by putting 2 we're telling it
hey we want to replace the second
occurrence
now we tell it from what file just say
textfile.txt
and i'm going to tell it to send
the replace text to a sample file
sample.txt there we go so now if we take
a look at
the sample file you can see that we have
very similar output except
the second occurrence of gps has been
replaced with gwyneth you see here
gps gps it's now gweneth first second
occurrence here it's now going
you notice that that first one hasn't
been replaced right but say now we
wanted to replace the second occurrence
in only the third line
well we could preface the s
command the substitute command with a
number to indicate that so we can say
something like
said three s
and then the rest is pretty similar so
gps
gwyneth and then the second occurrence
from the text file and let's create a
sample.2oh i forgot theredirect there alrighty so now if i do
cat
sample two we'll see here that the first
line
is the same the second line is the same
and then the third line the second
occurrence of gps was replaced
and that's a little crush course on the
set command
