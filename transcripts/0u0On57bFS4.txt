foreigndone with my udemy curse on CCP from
Stefan for my exam in December nicethat's what's upthat first I feel like if you study well
for your first certification for your
first class for vacation
each certification after that is
infinitely easier
as long as you take that first
certification
as you know you pace yourselfand you really take the time to learn
then everything after that has become
becomes like a lot easier to study in my
opinionyes I'm off from work today
I decided to take a day off today andtomorrow every
every couple of months or so I like to
schedule out like just one or two days
off and then I have myself a nice long
weekend
especially after hectic periods so this
past couple of months we had
students I had serverless September
student Summit pre-ignite events I did
two events at ignite and then I did an
internal event
and then now we're prepping for net comp
so but there's a little bit of kind of
space there
I'm actually working on a Blazer project
now for the demo of that butso every now and then I like to take
this time off just a couple of days to
not do anything but I'm still doing
stuff I'm still like working on
somethingum but yeahhow you doing hey GPS I'm majoring in
cyber security two semesters to go till
I graduate
I am also taking the Microsoft skill
challenge devops course what steps
should I take going forward I don't know
steps you should take going forward I
don't know
what you want to get into
yeah yeah yeah
umyeah do you know what role you want to
get into
uh but yeah JJ have a
have a good have a good day
thanks for coming byuh
I was planning on just
playing video games today but
I got sucked into this project that I'm
very much enjoying so
it's kind of just
you ever like work on something that you
enjoy so much where you can't stop
like you're kind of in the zone
just kind of where I'm at with this
projectlet's seewhat do we got hereloved your uh salary video oh thank you
yeah the response to that I got to the
video were interesting
I think um someone asked me like
if I'm ever scared of to talk about
money
and then I used to have that mindset but
then I felt like if I allow money to
have
any kind of power eventually is going to
have power over me and I never want to
live a life where money has power over
me so I'm more so like just try to be as
transparent as I can in a respectful way
because I don't think my value is
you know a professional
uh or as a human being is attached to
how much money I make like if I miss if
I got fired tomorrow which have y'all
seen the layoffs of Microsoft it was
like a thousand people lay off
uh what was it two days ago
thank youum
yeah that was wild so I don't use social
media anymore
um I decided to quit social media like
two weeks ago
so I only I only log in to like
promote or share anything that I need to
share but then I don't like consume it
personally like if I need to retweet
something whatever I need to yeah
so I didn't find out until layoffs until
I logged into Twitter and then someone
had dm'd me it's like oh hey Gwen
hopefully you weren't impacted by the
layoffs and I was like what the heck
so then I like went on to like search
for the news and yeah that's a thousand
people get laid off it's like wowI was thinking more into Cloud security
engineer there's a whole video that I
just did an interview with day who works
in security he um
it's like a whole hour more just talking
about how to get into the space I
recommend you watch that because I'm not
a professional in security so I don't
really have the best advice in that
video he mentions there's two
certifications he recommends every
single beginner do and then you start in
sock analysts and kind of move your way
up I don't remember what their
certifications were but they're in that
video I think it was like one or two
videos ago
platform versus devops engineering what
are your thoughts on the new title
I don't think devops engineer should
have ever been the title in the first
place because devops is a methodology
and also develops is something that
everyone should do
so if platform engineer comes and takes
over what the devops engineer was
supposed to do I don't really
necessarily have an issue titles or
titles this is the same thing where
someone asked me like do you think the
title Cloud engineer will go away I was
like maybe
I think cloud known as the way it's
known now the word will probably go away
but there's going to be a place where
um
you know you go and deploy your stuff
that's going to be managed if that's
Cloud if that's air if that's space
whatever it ends up being called like
that still is going to be a thing so
I don't know people don't need I don't
think people need to worry or
necessarily like get hung up on like
titles and whatnotyeah
it's cold in New York todaygot it thank you
start doing CTF and learn from try hack
me best of luck ah
I think I did one try hack me
room because I think they're called
Rooms right or I can't remember it was
fun
um I was just stuff that was as fun
for cloud that like try hacked me is for
um security butlet's see heream I 1080 yes I amwhat up easy how you doingI need to get another screen to put it
here
if not always end up looking over herehey GPSI want to get into Cloud mainly Cloud
security I'm an I.T specialist in the
military so I can only have four years
of experiences help desk I've earned the
job as a system admin managing
managing something
what up Jay
what up Finelli do you play Valerian no
I don't play
I play 2K I play writers RepublicI just finished dying lightum I I before that I played like Far Cry
6 I'm still playing Far Cry 6. I like a
lot of open world gamesI like games that I can just fully
immerse myself just by myself
and kind of just Escape everything a
breath of the Wild on switch is fun too
um
yeah one of my favorite games all of all
time is called days gone
and then I also really enjoyed sleeping
dogs I wish they made a sequel of that
that was such a great game but I'm a
very much open world type person uh
comes to that
over 500 accounts troubleshooting from
Hardware to software I've worked with
okay it's like what
who should I learn to subscribe so if
you want to get into Cloud security go
on my channel there's an interview with
this guy called day
he's a security engineer detection
security engineer at datadog and he
landed that role he's like 21 or 20
years old now he landed it all through
like uh leveraging prior experience
prior internships
and just kind of working really really
hard
um he doesn't have a degree he's still
in school and he kind of lays out
absolutely everything that he did
there's two certifications that he
mentioned that everyone who like sort of
wants to step into Cloud security should
do uh and then to kind of start from a
sock analyst role move your way up it's
a video on my channel from like two days
ago it's like an hour and a half long
interviewuh
uh he also mentioned that from the he
has the trifectus he has a plus Network
plus and Security Plus and then from all
that he really says that only that like
the network plus was what he would
consider useful which was an interesting
mindset but go watch that stream
best open world is Red Dead Redemption
2. that was a good game too yeah
absolutely
I don't I think I enjoyed sleeping dogs
more
um but that red dead was a good game tooum I'm playing Sleeping Dog
straightening sleeping dogs right now I
actually want to get into Watchdog ah I
played Watchdogs too I didn't play the
original one I played the second one
which is my favorite and then they came
out with that other one which it was
just well I can't remember what it was
called but it was just trying too much
it was fun but I found it like more
gimmicky than anything I really enjoyed
the second one thoughuh
uh hold on I'm gonna move this over here
so I'm not like watching this side all
the timehow much do you order on YouTube uh
anywhere from five hundred dollars to
uh 700 800 a month
it depends it fluctuates depends on how
much work I put into itand I I don't turn on ads on all my
videos so I could make significantly
more but hey
I have other priorities at the momentuh what's this other question hereI just found out that the dp300 has Labs
at the end of the exam I ended up
failing with 60 cents I would write the
exam next week oh the dp300 has Labs I
didn't know that that's coolwhich one is the dp300oh Microsoft Azure SQL
I want to get the cosmos DB
certification
I've been learning a lot of Cosmos DB a
lot of um specifically I mean I was
using the core sequel API
um
but now I'm doing more of the um
mongodb one the mongodb one has
uh it's been a lot more fun to work with
than
the core sequel one for sure but
I I can't I'm trying to like retrieve a
random document and there's like no
straightforward way
from a collection to do it also when I
was modeling up my data at the beginning
I was because my experience is somewhat
from like a relational
a relational
uh data like database so I was modeling
every single entity out in a table
and I sat down and I read this
documentation that mongodb they have
like a great example and I was like oh
my gosh mind blown
so yeah that's how I spent my yesterday
have you taken any yeah Linux uh Linux
Essentials is the only Linux
certification that I have
I think it might be expired by now I
think I might have expired the beginning
of this yearlet's seewhat else some open world games that I
really enjoyedlet's move this over hereI've been uh coding a lot let me see if
I can show y'alllet's move this hereuh we're gonna just remove
hold onbecause I'm trying to learn Blazer right
uh hold on that should be a demo all
right cool everyone hear me yeah yeah
okay so I'm trying to learn Blazer
um and what I have right now is
I really need to like
uh update
all right so I'm gonna comment this one
because I'm still figuring out how to
get a random document
but
everything else is uh sort of working
fine nowso let's start thisall rightif you had if you had a chance to learn
how to learn to code again how would you
do it
uh cyberpunk was trashdid it crash okay cool
so right now we have this terrible table
but
these are coming in from
these definitions are coming in from my
mongodb
database that's in Cosmos
if you have one collection right so
essentially what it is is going to be a
dictionary of just Cloud Concepts
but the kicker is each concept can be no
longer than 256. I might make it like
512 characters
so the whole theme will be like Cloud
Concepts explained in less than 512
characters or something like that right
uh I only put in two there for for at
the moment but the whole essentially the
whole API is like written out too so
ohwhat's it called insomnia the API thingumso if I do like get
my blanket is there
if I want to like add a new one uh I
don't need to put an i uh post
let's see put we can do post but I don't
need to provide and
ID here I could just provide like all
these other things
so I could say like containeruh what is a container uh
actually you know a definition I know
easily serverless serverless is
um
a compute model where you don't uh where
the
infrastructure is infrastruct structure
is managed by
the platform platform boom
and then I could just find like some
documentation on serverless
some sort of page
uh we'll just do this one hereI need docs I don't want like uhI want uh
so where's the docs page here
developer guide nosir let'soh my goodness how is it so hard
to find the docs page for a serverlessah here we go
you know what we'll just put this
for now
this is all dummy data anyway so it
doesn't really make a difference
so we'll do that all rightso if I send this to my definition I hit
sendit didn't accept no oh I forgot that
provided tag
oh hold on I know what I did wrong here
because
my function here so let's lower this
hereaction that is for my post so where's my
post here create this is
posts
create definition is asking for these
separately oh come on all right so then
that should be I need to update that
though because it shouldn't be that way
so this would be likeauthor name
and then author
what are we asking for author URLauthor URL and then we'll have this here
beautify that Json
and then you know before I
insert this we can delete this one
if I provide
wait is a delete working with the ID or
the word let's see post delete is
working with the word
I need to change that too
server
sure
serverless send
what that didn't work either
hold onwhere is my consoleexecuting serverless okay oh my goodness
so it is working with the ID
all right where let's grab all of these
we're serverless here
so then if I call my delete here
okay that worked so now if I do a get
get them all
it's gone so now if I do a post
it's oh I still didn't add a tag oh my
goodness Gwen come on so the good thing
about
when I have created UI is that I can add
all this validation in it so I don't
forget what I have to keep adding but
then we got to do the same thing so tag
would be like I don't know compute
all right
so then I need to delete this one so I
gotta delete
this one send and then get
all right serverless is gone and then
postwhat happened this did not postoh do I not have a tag in the
create create definition
I don't have a tag here all right cool
so there's a bunch of things we need to
change here
uh
what does it say hereso like a flash card program of sortsuh
uh yeah sort of no more like a
dictionary
how long do you work in a normal day uh
14 hours is add your favorite browser
yes
good luck can you do an internet speed
test nostringstring and then here in our delete we
gotta dohow can I become a Google Cloud engineer
by working really hard
string ID so this is gonna go here
we're gonna say oh what was thatmove here string ID string ID
all right let me check my Repositorywhen I create a new definition that's
fine coolwhat up everybody
otamaine hello the Rockstar is insomnia
personal choice over Postman
yeah
um I can't remember why I wanted to use
insomnia over
Postman I no idea I can't remember whyI think a postman started to get a
little too like bloated like there's
just so much going onoh my goodness I keep getting this error
that's because
in my indexuh uh index here I'm asking to load this
so for here we're just going to load
nothing here
for nowthe goal for this page is to eventually
haveum
a random quote up here here but for now
uh we don't need that
so I didn't close this also I don't need
my front end
we just need to run the API now so we'll
do thatum Network admin to ad Network admin
degree seven years Network admin
experience if I get a closer do you
think that would be enough to apply for
cloud jobs
uh clouds two Cloud search two Cloud
projects practicing a ring skills tailor
your resume tailor cover letter I think
you you should be in a good position
all right so what I was gonna do was
delete thisboomokay
then I'm gonna get everything perfect
then I'm gonna post this oneoh my goodness did I not why is that not
grabbing itgetwhy is it not grabbing the theuhwhat create definition
string tag oh come on
tag equals tag perfect okay cool
uh restart thatadmin
hi how you doing what up
even on days off I work which probably
not a good habit but heyall right so we're gonna do get we're
gonna delete that last one again and see
if it works now
so
delete this last oneperfect we're gonna get everything and
then we're gonna post
yeah there we go boom perfect
so now if I do hold onif I go to
debug everything we know
no why doesn't thethe option to oh no no no no stop thatthe multiple projects doesn't come up
here come onproperties multiple projects API start
client start I don't need to start my
shared
apply okay
all rightoh my camera flows hold onall right there we goall right cool
that works perfectlyjust wanted to say thanks for your
advice information has gotten me to
learning and using Cloud for my work
environment that's awesome congrats to
you uh happy to be happy to be just a
small partof your Cloud Journey
yeah something's up with this camera
like it keeps freezing I don't know whybut yeah so what I got to do is
essentially add like a bunch more I
think before I make this public
I want to have at least like 50
definitions
um and then there's a couple of other
things that I want to implement
uh to the actual project itself like it
looks hideous right now so
I want to use this thing called Mud
Blazer
mud Blazer
this thing hereuh because they have a lot of cool
components it's like I could probably
use like
true
umlike a card let me seeyeah like something like this
to show off
the
the quote itself like maybe something
like thator something something as simple as this
like word definition and then URL oh
wait because it has an author maybe need
something else thereum yeah so the project structure is
uh let me stop it
so this is a Blazer web assembly front
end so let me show you here
uh
our front end here this is a Blazers
Blazer webassembly project so that's
all.net our back end our serverless
functions I truly do believe like the
majority of things that you want to
build from scratch now in 2022 if you're
not trying serverless
like I don't know why so so the backing
is all serverless here uh right now it's
just like a simple API in this file here
um
and then we obviously have a shared file
between both of those projects uh with
just a bunch of models and whatnot
I want to there's a couple other
functionalities that I want to implement
but right now I'm just building a simple
APIuh but yeah yeah yeahuh let's try implementing thisthis this this thingwhere'd it gouh let's go hereall right boom was over heremud Blazerso let's implement this in my client
projectgetting started
[Music]uhwait no I don't want to use the
templatesall right so we need to add this packageuh uh where is it
you nougat no
nuget
I'm relatively new to
nougat like I'm pretty I usually use vs
code so this is like
there's like so much I mean I'm
relatively new to visual studio I
usually use
vs code so oh my gosh that's not the
right
hold onlet's just do it in here this like
there's so much that you can do in here
oh man
uh and then we'll just do thatuh browse
I just want mod Blazer here we go latest
stable installall right I need to do a refresh for
serverless hahayeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah serverless
is serverless is I don't know a lot of
people choose to like
hate on it but
these major corporations are using it so
learn it uh learn it while you can all
right so Imports just add this to import
client I think Imports is hereall right
umhmm
index or layoutfont and style references and index or
layout CS HTML index or layout
where is that it's probably here right
no it's probably in here
we go
so these are
I think these are
here perfect and then we're not going to
use this
these two anymoreall right uh
we need a script reference
all right script reference boomuh I'm completely new to anything coding
language I'm gonna watch a video about
which programming language you need to
learn awesome
you do that I think I said pythonanyone studying for AZ 700 which one is
700 I don't remember which one that is
uh removefile you can remember let's see the site
that CSS which I think is app.css
we can just delete this now
okay
and then
register services
all right let's register our servicesprogram at CS probably gonna have to do
it here
and then this one goes up hereboom uhI'm the opposite for me I used to visual
studio in college and I'm going to use
the visual code
yeah my uh actually I use Visual Studio
when I was uhwhen I was in my cloud engineering gig
because they were a c-sharp.net shop but
they were doing like
classic.net stuffbut I was developing the functions and
serverless stuff all in umoh my camera froze again come onhello uh but but there we go one twoI don't know why this thing keeps
freezing I'm probably gonna have to get
off and figure it out uh is it yeah but
yeah I was using visual studio code for
all the umfunctions and serverless stuff
because it works pretty welluh ad components that's just to
main.layout dot Razer main.layout dot
Razer
main dot layout dot razoruh should be in
shared I mean eraserthereis it free to use like for small
projects to learn what's free to use
what do you what are you asking
all right and then
is that it is that everything with that
let's start itbut I've been enjoying Visual Studio
I think for debugging like these types
of projects it's been
it's been a lot of fun what is going on
hereI literally don't see anythingto running it's like nothing hereah the layout got messed up let's see
what happened here
all right
uh ready for more we did that
we did thatwe did that
that was just sixoh maybe I wasn't supposed to erase all
this
maybe I just needed to copy this in here
all right
let's do that
serverless Azure functions has a million
execution executions for free
per subscription per why does this look
like this the heck
umokay someone looks different so
yes
essentially the compute is free if you
use storage and whatnot but it's still
going to be like pennies you know
especially for smaller projects
all right
so do they have like uh
they have they have wireframes okay coollet's do this like how do I copy this
no no maybe not that one maybe like
main layouts okay let's do this
man
uh
uh like this layout hold onokay I like this layout so
let's cut this is
this is the main layout
all right let's try thatoh come onobject of type okay let's see what's
going on here
oh these are commented out that's whyall rightwhat else is going on hereall right so how was it before let's see
let's copy this here it's at bodyso at body should workand then uhnow
nav menubut oh okay hold on I think I shouldn't
have erased
this
uh there
and then do that and then I can delete
this
right
and then this is nav menu
nav menuthere we gookay everything looks weirdoh wait that looks different now hold onokay
data
all rightstatic web apps the heck is this
this doesn't need to be here
I think we didn't likethere's some sort of CSS that's still
pretty weird here but we'll take a look
in a secondum what was it here
so that's good that's fine
mobilizers does are we not supposed to
use thisuh all right so anywaythat's that so if I grab like
I feel like you do this one hereoh my goodness there's so much hereall right
it's full screen this hereso I'm supposed to be able to grab this
component
and then let's swap out my fetch dataoh I think I know I was supposed to
delete this
okay so we'll swap just swap out my
fetch data but
we need this still so
what we don't need is all of thisthat okayso that's our componentand
no but we still should do okay never
mind we should do this instead
and then just put it inside the else
yeah yeah yeah
because if it's null we don't want
anything to load and we don't need this
many we just need one because we're
going to do a four each
like Loop uh through it soum
let me see let me see one cardoh items okay coolso I can delete all one item
second item
thereall right so that's just one item
significantly less
but we can do
for each
mod card my card header Mark cart item
Mark cart grid so we probably need to do
a 4H here so for eachVAR uh definition in Def
Nations we're gonna do this
actually we're gonna close all
my items here
format this
format
document
I have to do a at symbol here boomdo you work for fun yes I absolutely do
work for fun I love what I do for work
uh okay so let's format that once again
cool so for each uh card me
card head content we could make this
like at definition
definition dot word boom
uh
well what does the layout look likeso we could just make this the word
and then hear the definition and then
the button can have like
a link to the a link to the URL or
something like that
right
so we don't need any of these
for now I'm just going to erase those
for now so I don't know what these are
called but I'm going to erase themuh they were like
unlimited yeah so I don't need D I don't
need this
this hereand what is the monthly part
I don't need the monthly part either
so I can erase this is whaleand then I need the
actual definition itself
wait now let me see so beginner the five
where's the five dollarstart now is the button
all right so I'm gonna put here
definition not content
and then start now is going to be
learn more and then the href here
uh snow href
I think we'll have to do it like
href is going to equal at
a definition Dot
learn more URL
perfect let's see what this happenswhat up Athena how you doingaha I worked
so we got the word and then we got the
definition if I click learn more it
takes me to the docs look at that
perfect so
this looks like trash though but
uh I gotta fix but it looks a lot better
than what it was looking like beforeum
so I want to add like
a little tag here because remember each
one has
a category that it belongs to and then
obviously this text has to be smaller
than that
and then I don't need to have these here
or this up here so let's remove that
stuff here
ah and the cool thing is that there's
hot reload so if Icome on I can't move this over okay
so if I like erase this
and hit save it should
there we go automatically do it without
me having to launch it againuh cool and then I also don't wantoh hold on this is just I don't have big
enough screen to do that
so I also don't want
uh this I don't need this eitherwait continue editingwhat's wrong with this oh I have to all
right rebuild that apply changes what
are consider entry-level Cloud jobs
Cloud support Cloud analysts Cloud
um
sysadmin why is this still here
um
and I don't want this to be open by the
default
so let me change thatso that's probably like a toggle here
hold on
dudeuh
how do I how do I toggle thatoh that's gotta be like the layout rightoh here we go boomand where is that coming in from here so
I don't need this here
all right let's run that
class blower Cal admins uh sis admin
Cloud analysts
there we go cleaner Dutch datalovely okay cool
so let's look at their docs because
that's how you learn things
let's go to
like their typography
uh here we go
no I need like
oh here we gono I need to know like oh here we go
uh nobody body one but they don't have like
examplesuh like
field no
I need like examples text fieldthis oneno components they have like text here
oh here oh here we go niceso I guess the word itself can be like
an H3 or maybe an H4 and then the
definition can be like a body body too
let's do like a body too
so I have too many of these open I don't
need this here this here
this this this this this this
this all right so I don't need this open
either I don't need this open either
Dutch data I'm gonna do H I think we
said H3 for the word and then
uh body two
body two for that
hey GPS working on my cloud resume
challenge right now got you in the
background thanks for the motivation
let's go Patrick
appreciate you watchingum
let me know if you get stuck be happy to
help all right that's way too big
I thought we said that was the right
size let's see let's go over here
let's do H5 I thought I did do H5please tell me that I'll refresh without
me having to nice
very very much more clean like that
so let's add the tags with some other
type of
elementum
so let's look
uh now Avatar
that's cool but
I don't think that's like what I want
badge no
buttons no card
no that's what I'm using right yeah
Carousel charts
I would like to at some point have
charts where it's like this has been the
most popular word looked at for this
past week or something like that
um but that's not what I want
right now
oh cool all right so
let's make it like primary like how do I
do like primary trip
color
primary
that's this one right yeah all right so
then we can put that in
uh where do we want to put it
so let's stop thislet's do it definition to content
beneath the content
and then the thingy here the value would
be at
definitiondot dot oh my goodness dot tag
boomadd definition dot tag
uh tags with a capital all rightlet's seeoh that looks terrible
and also with it being the same colorI don't like that but Okay cool so let's
pick a different coloruh where is itoh that might be nicer a smaller onelabels
oh uh
I might like this better hold on let's
see
yeah that might be betterthey will label chips use the default
theme border radius oh and we can make
them smaller too that might be better
so let's do let's do different color
let's do us like uh like this primary
uh
like let's do this one herelet's go over here and then replaceyou should replace the contentthen erase this one and then apparently
we can also make this smaller by
selecting the right size herelet's make it small
copy thisall right uh we have to restart thiswhere to goI didn't restartoh that looks nicer
it still is like
like too close to this like I think they
have um like a spacing element that you
can use
oh a divider might be niceyeah like this that looks nicewhat is it did you do my my dividerall right let's
stop this
and then we wanted it between these two
hereall right y'all oh you know what I'm
tired of like moving let's just embed
this element in the index for right now
uh
let's just do load fetch data
for now because
if not I'm going to keep having to go
into the page and I don't want to do
thatoh see that looks cleaner
now we also need to add the author like
um the name of the author hereum
I don't know how I'm gonna do that
because
like ideally so I want to make it an
open source project where
like there's going to be a feature where
you can be like submit your own
definition and it'll ask you to like you
know type in the word the definition
your URL in the link and then I'll run
that through cognitive Services as like
a first pass to make sure there's no
foul language to make sort of some
negative content
um and then I'll have it go like
manually to like blob storage or
something like that
um so I can review it and then once I
hit like okay I'll have a function that
will automatically publish it to the
database
but a lot of the initial definitions are
going to be just
from my uh end so I don't know if I want
to say a show like author
author here because that's going to be
like my name a lot but I think it would
be cool open source contributions for
people who are like just getting started
and whatnotuh so what is something else so let's
add like another definition though
let's do Post let's call let's do um
what's another Cloud uh let's do like
application
application security Let's do an
application Security Groupa group of rules uh no no
a way of grouping
virtual machinesuh via their app like
locations
yeah there there actually we'll do the
other purpose via their purpose
you can set your
network security boob desk uh
destination
and source
to be an application Security Group
application Security Group
uh
we can do like oh you know what we
should have like abbreviation too
as
G G's r
away
Bears machines via their purpose your
purpose and
uh
and you can there we go
this would be like networkingyeah something like that
we should have abbreviations because
like
oftentimes that's the issue like when
you're getting started you hear like AKs
NSG asglb
um
I don't know
f-a-a-s-p-a-pes yes like you hear all
these things so like one day you go to
like the cloud dictionary you're like
what is NSG and then like it pulls it up
via abbreviation oh my goodness let's do
that
let's we're going to do this now so
okay cool I love the I love this idea I
love it all right so we're gonna hit
post
and then I'm gonna get everythinguh and then what we're gonna do is add
abbreviations so let's update
we're gonna update our modeland then we update the date individuallyyeah yeah this is such a oh I love when
these ideas come like like yes such a
freaking good idea all right so now
since I've updated the API I can do
refresh here and it should automatically
pull in another thingy there
so
let me think hereah
all right let's do thisso what I'm going to do now is create an
abbreviation and then we could put the
abbreviation right under the thingy
under the definition
like in maybe like in like a caption
type typography
or size
um but for that I need to update my
model firstso we have to go to shared
definition model and then in here we're
gonna have
uh
I can call this
uh Brie V Asian
uh abbreviation and then this will need
to be a capital
cool
and then this can be a null because not
everything is going to be have
abbreviation
uh cool so and then our repository
that's fine
our function itself should need to
change because we're retrieving the
entire collection
let's see definitionsget get
definitions yeah that shouldn't
okay but when we are creating we do need
to providestring uh breviation
all right
so then when we add abbreviation perfect
love it so that's for creating and then
when we update we need to do the same
existing
definition dot abbreviation equals
abbreviation
oh I forgot to add thestring abbreviation deviation oh
abbreviation
string tag as well because I don't have
that in there
then string of variation equals
abbreviation
and then existing tag equals look at it
filling in for me all right cool so
that's for updating all right sweet so
now I have to grab all the elements and
then add abbreviations to them if they
have them
and then showcase them there
uhyeah so now let's run everythingeveryone do me a favor hit a like on
this on the Stream
um I'm gonna answer little questions a
little later
I just got sucked into working on this
project that I enjoy that I'm enjoying
so I don't know why there's space up
here I don't like that but we'll figure
that out later
so now we're gonna go in here and then
we're gonna grab like for example
I think we've put
works of
I just uh grab this hold on getuh abbreviation oh my goodness I made a
typo where
where
not hereuh not here I did it in
abbreviation ah here we go abbreviation
thank you very much
I gotta stop this though
well look at those Keen eyes
abbreviation
lovely
did I do it right in the models and
whatnot
yeah because we're calling the
abbreviation that's goodall right we're good right abbreviation
is double is double byeah it's fine okay cool I was just
checking all right so now what we're
gonna do isupdate so I need to make individual
functions so I can update specific
properties but right now I'm just gonna
do like update all the properties
so we're gonna get all of our thingies
and then we're gonna update see all
these are null abbreviations right so
I'm going to do is like grab
this one and put it into a put request
because put will update it
but put needs the ID I believe right
put Works off the ID definition
update yeah we just need the ID okay so
that's the ID we don't need to update
the ID
but application security group that have
a does have an abbreviation which would
beASG
uhthat's notapplications Security Groupoh I feel like I'm
doing so many Azure ones maybe that
could be a tag too though
that's a good idea like it'll be like oh
this is specific to azure
even though all clouds use it they just
call them different thingsit would make my life so much easier if
they all called it the same thingokay cool
so if I do send that and then I do get
everythingnetworks oh no I made another mistake
all right we're going to do this again
oh wait so we're just gonna go put
I need again I need to change
them so it accepts Json the way it
returns it
author name I think this is author
URL okay there we goboomall rightokay so now if I do get
all right fantastic the other one that
has
load balancers also have abbreviations I
believe which is lbso we're going to grab this one and then
update it
or definition
uh we need to remove this arrayabbreviation would be
lbthere's one more on the line where you
have to scroll over to the right oh now
my camera froze again goshall right there we gouh uh all right cool cool cool I'll be
there username author this is author
name author nameauthor url url url you are
URL there we go send
and if we do getit soon our security group load balancer
all right let's do this network security
group one
uh uh putsso for the ones that don't haveuh abbreviations
I wonder ifit'll give me an issuelike when displaying it in the componentnetwork security group is Network
Security Group I gotta figure out what's
wrong with my camera
foreign
so anyway beautify other Jason send it
get
all right
wait whatI replaced the wrong one
wait no did II never excuse yeah I probably replaced
the wrong one all right whatever now we
have this one twice
I can't remember what it replaced
but we'll delete this oneget all right so we have application
Security Group
uh Network Security Groupand then we have serverless which
doesn't have his own abbreviation all
right
so if we go here we should only have
three
I lost one network security group
serverless oh I lost load balancerall right so apparently there's another
one
uh Brie abbreviationI don't see I know every VA
uh really a a brevi a
I don't see it anywhere
where
all the way to the right I'm looking at
so down here every V8 abbreviation
abbreviation I feel like I got it right
no
abbreviation
abbreviationI think I got it right okay cool
okaytwo B's in abbreviation yeah
2B is an abbreviation
all right so now we'll go to fetch data
or stop everything here
and then what we're going to do is we're
gonna put like a really small oneon
like here so we'll use like
uhI don't know caption text caption text
like this hereso under the word
and then here we'll just call this at
definition
dot uh abbreviation
there
all right let's see what this does
two bees for a second I thought this is
be 2bs
and I was like what's BS
ah nice so it's really small but it's
here they're coming in here so that's
good
so
so I like that
but we have to we just have to center it
but I don't know I'm gonna worry about
like that in a little bit
oh these have links too so like you can
link click on these as well
that's nice all right so let me add
another one hold on
post word we're gonna call it do I have
load balancer saved in any of these
serverless application group I don'tno okayall right we're gonna call this load
balance
balancer
uh
a load balancerdistributes incoming
Network traffic
amongst a group is that how you spell
amongst
probably notuh
uh amongstyes it is wow look at me
wait no it was over hereoh no totally didn't amongst
a group of
virtual machines
you know what I just thought about this
when we reference a concept in another
concept that should be linked to that so
you can click on that and be taken oh my
gosh look at me
a group of virtual machines a group of
amongst a group of virtual machines
uh or resources
because it could be like something else
besides Rich machines I mean at the end
of the day everything's a virtual
machine right
uh and then
I don't know what the URL for load
balancers is
load balancer azureokay cooluh no here tag networkingand then we move localizationsweetoh my goodness again I didn't provideuh
thereI didn't provide abbreviationuh abbreviation uh breviation
should be lb abbreviation
get
all right Coolio
and then
where is my website herenice all right cool cool let's switch to
uh
let me let me pull this up one secondall right so that was a significant
amount that I wanted to get done todaywhich is good
but yeah this thing mud Blazer makes it
so easy so easy to like not have to
worry about
making things look nice
uh I once heard someone complain that
like all Blazer Pages look
like Blazer apps look similar and I'm
like I don't necessarily
care if it looked similar I just like
there's the fact that I don't have to do
any work like any hard work to get it to
work or get it to alert look decently
it's awesomeso yeah anyway
I have a name
for the project I I have the domain
already but it's cool because it's a DOT
cloud
domain and then it's going to be dot
Cloud slash whatever the word is so dot
Cloud slash load balancer dot Cloud
slash
um oh maybe the Slugs can be
abbreviations if they have it if not
it'll be the fruit maybe a full word
would be easier
yeah okay
let's think about but anyway we've hung
out for an hour
uh I'm gonna go and actually spend my
day off chilling but I'll see y'all
later
