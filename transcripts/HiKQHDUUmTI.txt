hey what's going on everybody so uh
we're doing this series with chloe
condon who is a senior cloud advocate at
microsoft we're on actually the same
team which is pretty great
and we're doing this whole series where
we're covering resumes and cover letters
and all that kind of stuff that you need
to apply for jobs it's called how can i
help i'll have a little link
information so you can attend as well
in the description but the point of this
video is to sort of react or roast my
resume from 2019
because uh i don't know i feel like it's
it's it's it could be like a therapeutic
activity that i could do and maybe if
anything stands out
for you all it'll help you perfect um i
did sort of go into this on stream on
our first session for the series that i
just mentioned so i can link to that so
y'all can watch that as well
but yeah let's let's dive into it oh hi
i'm gps and welcome to a new video
for initial thoughts when i opened this
and i was like blurring things out i'm
like wow this is super short
but i've always liked one pagers because
um and this was an assumption i had
before i actually knew it was a fact
people really only take less than a
minute i think chloe on stream was
mentioning it's like the first 10
seconds they look at your resume and
they're like is it worth looking into or
not
and if they see like a bunch a bunch a
bunch a bunch pages it's pretty much
gonna it sort of comes off as like
there's a lot of fluff right
i used to think that i was very arrogant
for having a one page resume but it's
worked in my favor so here we are
name nice and big and then i had my
youtube channel right away i also have
my email and my phone number here
but i knew at that point i had a bunch
of videos and tutorials and all that
kind of stuff on my youtube and a lot of
those showcased my not only who i am as
a person and my ability to communicate
things but also my technical skill set
because a lot of my videos were on azure
functions and azure in general
then we have certifications yeah i get
this question a lot like which search do
you have at this point i was already a
call engineer that was my current role
and i had only had the aws certified
developer associate
that's literally all i had
and then we dive into employment history
again i don't have any
i guess substantial
college education or educate or like
boot camps or any programs or anything
like that besides certifications so i
just have certifications and employment
history in here too
oh let's start from the bottom of
employment history because usually you
go in like um
like a timeline like the most recent one
you put on top but let's go from the
bottom because
that was my first gig i guess ever like
legal job on paper was the the the one
at the apple store i was a technical
specialist
and i guess i summarized my entire time
which was about a year and a half there
um in three bullet points so resolved
mac os ios and icloud issues repaired
replace installed mac desktops laptop
mobile device components answered apple
product technical support questions in
english and spanish looking back i would
have added one more here that's that
would have been like
documented issues or or created tickets
of like customer issues
uh for every single
i don't know like
encounter whatever every single customer
that came in because
i remember at the apple store gig
every person who would come in and we
would have like these appointments like
oh i need to fix this every single issue
was a ticket and there was a lot of
documentation and triage that would be
put into those tickets and that was
extremely extremely valuable for for my
help desk gig so i should have put that
in there uh but yeah that's overall that
some sums it up pretty nice and maybe
things like um
participated in training or something
like that would have been great too but
uh i mean i guess didn't hold me back
then we got my helpdesk gig that i was
there for wow two years
provided frontline technical support to
end users on time according to sla
assisted in relocating facilities
setting up most i.t infrastructure
office 365 administration and documented
it tasks of general interest for
internal users so i think what was key i
mean all this was key for my sysadmin
gig later on but really this office 365
administration um
like popped out for
for my the person who hired me for this
one and i know this because i asked this
person so
uh the the certification i know uh like
helped my resume at that point um
but keep in mind that was like
2018 yeah 2018. so a couple years ago um
and
actually hold on where are we yes right
here so office 365 administration
because these were things like
uh creating users updating
permissions and all kinds of things
and then also the frontline technical
support to end users according to sla
was important to this sysadmin uh gig
because again since it's an operation
role and you're sort of
uh working for be like vr requests and
things like that
being familiar with those kinds of
things in terms of like
how to handle when people approach you
or how to handle requests over the phone
and things like that
it definitely helped here
uh and again document documented it
tasks of general interest for internal
users
and then the doc if i had added that
here you can see that there's a
consistent
like very important thing that i've been
doing for years since this gig 2014
which is documentation
um all right so that was this that's the
helpdesk gig then i landed the sysadmin
gig and this is where i was exposed to
azure in my life to azure
my life was introduced to azure or azure
was introduced in my life whatever um
here at atlassian suite administration
so this was things like creating
workflows in jira
creating custom reports and dashboards
uh using jira for you know my own
ticketing system
um
uh what else was done there oh using
jira for also for like
like
agile and sprints and things like that
yeah so
uh not only was i using it to document
my work uh with confluence but also
to
you know
for the ticketing system and then also
for the sprints and stuff like that so i
had like a lot of jerry experience in or
at lasting sweet because the last scene
is confluence jira and i think like a
bunch of other things
but yeah
office 365 administration this was uh
even like creating users and onboarding
and all that kind of stuff but i
remember i was personally like automated
that it was done being done all manually
and then when i got here i automated it
with a powershell so it was great that
was like my first
actually i might have done some
powershell here but i think it was like
definitely solidified up here
provided frontline technical support to
end users again this is consistent here
and then here scripted manual tests
using powershell and python yeah see
again that's the office 365 and then
python i used later for some um azure
stuff that i
that i uh had created we can dive into
that a little bit later
documents i t tasks of general interest
for internal users actually just copied
this
over here uh assisted with cloud
infrastructure tasks i think in here
um i would have like erased these two
and then gone a little bit more specific
into what tasks
i worked on or maybe like projects
but overall not too bad
uh cloud engineer currently primarily
use um
net and serverless tools to write cloud
applications that save the company money
and colleagues time
deploy architect administrate and
monitor solutions and infrastructure and
azure shortened development life cycles
and time to market by building and
maintaining safety and pipelines and
azure devops create documentation on my
work and present company present company
wide participate in daily scrum meetings
and weekly check-ins with my supervisor
tricksters okay so not bad but i think i
would have removed so i would have
removed one
i think i would remove these three and
actually provided examples of projects
that i implemented because at this point
actually i don't remember exactly when i
created this resume but i'm sure i would
have had like some solid projects under
my belt by then and i would have more
like written something like um
created
application or or architecture solution
whatever it might be project
with uh
azure functions that save the company
this month this many hours this much
money and what i've dived in a little
like an extra bullet point there that
would have said like
implemented with this technology and
that kind of stuff so so at this point i
think it would have been more valuable
to share
the projects themselves than the actual
like sort of these just like generic and
general things
um i also don't have an area here for
projects that i've done on the side i
don't think i had many like the amount
that i have now
uh like on my github and things like
that but
for example i would have had like let's
go to my github right now
and let's go to my repos
and i would have added something like i
think
a good project would have been that's
probably a little too
oh like the resume my resume challenge
thing i would have added this thing here
and then of course i would add my
uh like my my my self-talk guide and
then
what's another one that i have
maybe yeah let's use those three so like
my
uh resume challenge how i like you know
because there's architecture here
prereqs that you need all those kinds of
stuff all those kinds of things are in
here
and i would have added that one i would
have added this daily positive news sms
serverless project that i made because i
remember documenting this well how to
set up your code environment api
credentials package use set up all the
kinds of things that you need to do to
run it um it's all in here as well so i
would have added that to my projects
section of my resume
and then
my self-taught guide to cloud computing
also
this more speaks to like i guess my way
of documenting and commuting commute
yeah communicating things right so i
would have added that to my resume so i
probably would have removed so if i had
to update this resume now which i don't
i'm surprised i don't have an updated
version or maybe this is something we'll
do on stream that would be great
i would probably remove this last one um
maybe even this service desk analyst one
these last two and just put projects
there
but besides that i think it's pretty
solid all right so um yeah that was my
resume back in 2019
i don't necessarily think it was great i
don't think it's too like it's hideous
or bad it's terrible um you can tell
that i'm just like straightforward i'm
there's not a lot of fluff i'm like kind
of what you see is what you get and i
think employers like
have value that
um
yeah there's not like a lot of buzzwords
or things like that or like you know
people will put like skills like
uh hiking or something like that for
whatever reason um yeah so that i enjoy
uh there are now things that i look back
i'm like i could have done this way
better um but maybe we'll get my resume
makeover on stream or something like
that
anyway uh
yeah if you have any questions let me
know and i'll do a video on them or
something i don't know alright see you
on the next one
