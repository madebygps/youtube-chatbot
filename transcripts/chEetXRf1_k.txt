what up party peopleuh let me make sure I'm livesoI learned today that you're supposed to
have your microphone slightly to the
side
so your plosives don't hit as much don't
hit as hardso that's good to know
uh how's everyone doingquite an interesting day todayuh happy hump day
all thosewords of encouragement uh cliche as it
sounds probably hate a little
a little warmer todayuh zxy hello hello hello Cisco how you
doing SP plays what's going on
uh sterling silver
how you doing
John how you doing
uh how you doing Sam
uh I hope all is great with you today
yeah yeah it's been
I mean I try to be
grateful every day right because there's
many things to be grateful for but uhit's a tough tough day today especially
given the news with my employer
the stream we're all waiting for let me
Kayla ask for Microsoft are we all
doomedI assume you saw satya's email as well
as based on the title yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah I mean it's not just the email
I saw
like there were a lot of um
people sharing
that they've been laid off on Twitter on
LinkedIn stuff like that that I just uh
checked out before hopping on this live
I tried to
stay off
for the majority of the day
yeah I was trying to like I mean I
blocked Twitter and Linkedin
during the work day anyway
uh so I just it was kind of hard to do
it today but I tried to do as much as I
can and got through as much work as I
could without getting into it because I
knew once I started to look
at people's updates it was going to be
just chaosin terms of like my own feelings it's
tough you know I know I'm often saying
like business you know business is going
to make business moves and I kind of say
that for myself to kind of have my own
back and and then just you know be smart
with finances but at the end of the day
these people are
you know they have a whole livesno matter how financially prepared or
you are like a layoff is a layoff so
it's difficult the
to feel any kind of like
excitement or happiness for ituh hey how you doing
I like the name Cisco I want to have a
cat my name is Cisco well like another
cat because I already have one she's
she's like down there playing she'll
sometimes hop on here so maybe she will
uh
I was not
laid off today that doesn't mean that
I'm not laid off in general it just
doesn't this just means I haven't heard
about anythingum
I
it's the end of my work day
because it's five o'clock here in New
York I'm on East Coast time
and I haven't heard anything so I guess
that means for today I'm safe but it
sucks I mean I think that feeling of not
knowingis
yeah it's it's like not really niceuhlayoffs happen gotta be prepared see I
understand this and this is why I'm like
very financially responsible this is why
I save
like crazy almost to the extent of like
limiting happiness in the present day
butyou can't really understand how it feels
unless it happens to you which is why I
don't fully understand either because it
hasn't happened to me and I've never
been laid offso just I don't know I just feel like
the tough luck tough love kind of
conceptit's just never gonna be the best
approach sotwo cats Cisco and Juniper yeah
that's a good idea but the thing is I
already have one cat her name is Zoe so
that means I'd have to get two more cats
and have three cats in total and that's
way too many catsjust finished my finished my day up and
watching LinkedIn just exploding with
notifications of layoffs remote I
haven't even been
up to date with what's going on in AWS
obviously very aware of what's going on
Microsoft
um
but yeah shout out to all my Microsoft
colleagues and friends at AWS
tough it's tough
uh but also hello Eric oh and also hello
Jeff thanks for tuning in
you know positions they are laying off
for I don't knowdon't know but GPS your Cloud Guru don't
do this to us do what to us we'll talk
aboutit's hard to say motivated especially
when all these days are happening and
you are new in Tech
I did uh I did an interview
with Katie uh Kathie Lee
it's on my channel
um just honestly just she's just one of
the people that
I've learned so much from
in just brief amount of conversations
that I've had just because of the years
of experience that she has in the field
and she's been through three or four
different periods of layoffs
uh and then she was mentioning how you
know if she were to get laid off now she
has 23 years of experience and like five
or six different software developer
roles like she ultimately would be fine
but
it's the newbies it's new people in Tech
who don't have a network to Leverage
who you know hadn't really gone through
something like this so it could
potentially impact them you know maybe
some people are coming out of college
and have that debt on their back like
that's tough tough to think aboutyeah
I think they said they were letting
people go until Q3 and only some got the
notification today I believe oh my
goodness also I don't know any of this
stuff to be
like facts or anything like that
um
I'm not here to
share any rumors or any emails or
anything like that all I know is that I
was laid off today and I know some
people were
not being called as I promise companies
always look out for themselves yeah
business is business people look out for
themselves you gotta look out for
yourself but that doesn't just because
that is the fact doesn't make the
reality any less
difficult righthow do you prepare for a layoff you mean
emotionallythis might be in response to someone
else who said you got to prepare
I mean and that's the thing and I like
that you brought this up it's like you
can prepare as much as you want
financially but emotionally a lot of
people do enjoy their work do want to
continue doing their work uh look
forward to doing that kind of stuff so
having it be a decision made for you
that oh you're just gonna stop doing
this like that can take an emotional
toll I don't care if you have passion
for the role or don't have passion for
the role like to an extent this is going
to affect you in other ways that are not
just Financial ways
and oftentimes it's these other ways
they're not Financial where we are less
prepared here's my cat
where we are less prepared to
or we have less tools to prepare for
because what does it even mean to be
emotionally prepared for a layoff all
right
I might have to meet this one secondshe loves rubbing up on this mic drone
okay you can stay here but you can't rub
on the microphone because it makes a
weird noise for everyone who's listening
okay
she's uh so she's an adult cat she's
about five years old now she has major
band admittent issues so she always
likes to be
in the presence of someone doesn't
always have to be necessarily like right
up
she's also purring very loud right now
but she's she's five and uh prior to me
adopting her she's been at a couple of
different homes which is where she
developed the abandonment issues because
she's constantly thinking like oh I'm
gonna be left like where's a new place
that I have to get used to but she's
been with me for a couple of months
she's great lovely cat very loving but I
have this issue when I want to work or
do something is that she'll want to hop
on and be very close so
tending to
trying to give her attention and make
her feel safe is is uh important
let's see here now she also cut me off
emerging fund three six months if
possible yeah well that should be a
default
like you should have three to six months
in savings no matter what for any kind
of reason rightit's happened to me before I'm not
saying this always happens but it turned
out for the best out to me grew as a
result from moving on absolutely I mean
you're not gonna stay in in in like your
home and be like all right well I got
laid off and I'm not gonna do anything
absolutely not but
yeah
I don't think any of it makes it easier
I believe the majority of the layoffs
came from HR Headhunters with some
specific engineering divisions
interesting
so are these layoffs for cloud parts of
Microsoft 2 I thought Cloud was very
much needed cloud is needed but when it
when it comes to the economy like no one
is safe
when it comes to a layoff I don't really
think anyone is safe there's no such
thing as a layoff proof for session
proof role
uh HB has been following you for the
past three months and I'm starting the
cloud journey and I'm starting your six
month six month plan I have to ask you
if it is enough to get an internship
after that
so I think it's enough of a skill set to
land an internship but a lot of Landing
roles is a lot more than just
technically being able to deal with the
role requires you to do remember land
income kind of rolls is a lot about your
resume it's a lot about your people
skills it's a lot about being able to
communicate your skill set so make sure
you develop that as well I would also
say it's very useful to have some sort
of online presence some sort of online
portfolio as well
building your network both virtually and
in person is very important attend
meetups attend job fairs attend as many
events in persons as you can get your
name out there have that tailored resume
have that tailored cover letter if you
are in school that's a great way to
build connections to build a network uh
maybe there's professors maybe there's
even internships at your school like
maybe there's like a support role or
help this role that you can leverage
anything that gives you some sort of
working experience is going to be
helpful to keep all that in mindsucks GPS I remember previous videos you
were prepping for this possibility I did
not think it would happen at Microsoft
those seems no tech company is safe no I
mean I always have the mentality that
I'm gonna get fired
um even if the economy is fantastic so
as morbid as that sounds it does help me
prepare
um
but I always thought like there's no
real company that's safe to this kind of
stuff
our small team went through Severance
offers at the end of 2020 which ended
with the rest of our team leaving and
are eventually getting laid off and you
know what we're all better at paying
remote we're all at better paying remote
jobs that's awesome happy to hear the
[Music]
um
the positive outcome
and uh
yeah I guess ultimately you know it's
gonna be okay for sure but it's still
like
I like to
I guess now because I have a sense of
community and somewhat of an audience
even though I don't like that word
I think it's just important for us to
come together and be like oh we're not
alone kind of thing because feeling kind
of alone in situations like this will
make everything 100 worse like most
most negative situations right
also thank you for asking us constantly
your videos to be financially
responsible I feel like I I might freak
people out that I talk about it so much
but
uh I never knew anything about money
until like I knew so I only knew that
you were supposed to make money and save
money because that was sort of like the
the the financial knowledge that my
parents have and there's something wrong
with that it's more so that that's what
they had so that's what they passed
along
it's not till I met a friend of mine I
was working at an Apple Store
who she taught me about credit she
taught me about investing and kind of
gave me hints and then I took that and I
went and bought books and I saw videos
on YouTube and things like that and
that's why I know a lot more now
um but that was ultimately one thing
that really really held to me I remember
when I left my cloud engineering job
there was a few months between Landing
my next job after that and I could have
never made that jump if I had didn't
have like my safety net money but I
would have not known how to do that in
like a responsible way uh in like a real
realistic way if it weren't for the
education that I you know
read and watched and it and if it
weren't for that friend and a lot of
times that friend doesn't exist for a
lot of people so you end up kind of
having this
I guess
um like non-existent Financial knowledge
throughout your life until maybe the
injury maybe you never do
so I try to be that virtual friend for
all of youabsolutely this is a speaking point that
made me rush to subscribe to GPS content
oh thank you did you get burnt out
during studies or work and how did you
do uh
not really I don't think I've ever
experienced burnout
um
I I'm a very organized and scheduled
scheduled first type person so
like for example today I was like I'm
gonna end work by five it doesn't matter
how much I'm like get done or don't get
done I'm ending work at five
which is a little earlier than it
usually
and work I usually kind of work until
like seven o'clock
um but I knew today I was gonna need
some extra time later in the day mainly
because yesterday I worked until like
nine o'clock nine pm
um but also just given the context of
where
and what's going on everywhere
but I don't really yeah get burned out
mainly because I schedule time
to do uh
to do other things I also have people in
my life that really hold me accountable
to not working as much into paying
attention to other aspects of my life I
have this cat now like if I don't play
with this cat or feed this cat by the
like 7 ish 7 30ish she will meow
non-stop so it'll force me to stop
working it's great get yourself a cat
Rafael what up though what's up how you
doing everyone do me a favor hit a like
on the stream let's try to hit I I
always try to hit a number on these
let's let's go for we're at 48. let's
try to hit 100. I've never hit 100
people watching this live streams oh
she's coming back uh so it'd be cool to
hit it today so do me a favor and hit
like on that let's move this mic back
this way cats always know cats always no
because it's going to lay on the
keyboard 100 so she did ruin my keyboard
she did ruin my keyboard I now have some
sticky keys because she knocked over
coffee on my q and for those who don't
know and maybe you do know this is my
favorite keyboard This is a Microsoft I
think compact design keyboard yeah it
doesn't have any backlight it's not
rechargeable it looks it uses like one
of those watch batteries right
um
but I love this thing I can't remember
how much I could I bought for it but
it's quiet it's so low profile uh you
can use it with multiple devices it's
easy to put in the backpack so when I go
into the office I just throw it in there
it's durable I've dropped it but of
course my cat had to ruin it I guess the
coffee ruined it
um
so there's that but now I have to get
another keyboard I'm torn because the
local Best Buy doesn't have one of these
and they won't have them in stock for
you have to like order them Amazon says
they're not an orange stock either
um and I was just talking about this the
other day I was like I need to order
like two or three more of these just in
case they discontinue them and then here
we are now
I'm not opposed to trying other
keyboards if anyone has any suggestions
I would
like to know uh I don't like make I I
can do mechanical keyboards if they're
quiet
um
but I just don't like the clickety-clack
it's just too much especially with like
video recording and streaming it just
it's too too disruptive on the
on like the background is hold on
I think my partner just arrived I can
hear her at the door and that's why the
cat ranshe thinks I'm gonna be laid off LOL who
thinks you're gonna be laid off
did I miss a messageI'm actually third semester student Cs
and have done PF
P fun program fundamentals uh
object-oriented programming data
structure algorithms and database
Management Systems that's like a good
good set there you should be able to
find internships with school rightuh let me see here
do you reckon remote jobs will be rare
now
ah this is tough
given how many tech companies want
people to come back in uh to in person
or like a hybrid thing I don't think
they'll be rare I mean I think I think
there's definitely more than there was
before the pandemic but I like to
I I whenever people ask me like is cloud
like a remote friendly role I think
remote is not something that's
associated with a role specifically or
field specifically that is more so based
on your team based on your organization
based on your company like they will
Define remote so that the the the
relationship with remote work and your
ability to do remote work maybe it's
like a seniority thing like it really
depends on like the rules that your
company has in placecan Cloud jobs be done remotely sure
Ro Cloud jobs remote no
this is something I don't have a
tailored cover letter would you be able
to give some examples yeah I have a
video on my channel it goes in it's
called something resume
I have to look it up
wow my cat is meowing a lot is she
hungry
foreignI have my uh Microsoft cover letter
example
on my YouTube there's a YouTube video it
says cover letter tips and tricks or
resume tips and tricks something like
that that is I'm actually using my
resume and my coverlet as an example be
sure to take a look at that my role with
cover letters is
I know a lot of people think that
they're not worth doing because they're
often skipped but if it's a role that
you really really want you can
potentially make a difference with a
solid cover letter so do it that's why
for my Microsoft one I definitely did it
I took my timeum made it short and sweet and it worked
my boss read it he told me later that he
did read it so
there's that
uh
honestly I'm amazed that high schools
don't have mandatory Financial class
yeah that's like fine like Finance taxes
investing all that kind of stuff like
given the importance of the stock market
in the US like why isn't finance a thing
in high school
all right
I used to think you save most of your
money but the truth is you're gonna
invest in the next one long term yep
I don't want to become a finance
like Channel I don't want to give all I
would say people is go it's really
really easy to kind of find like a like
a general frame Finance framework for
you to go and implement
like okay what do I do with my money
where do I place my money I like to
think of it like a pipeline like each I
get two paychecks a month I know where
every quantity of that paycheck goes
into what
what that looks like for you will be
different than me of course
um
but like look it up yeahI'm less Amazed by that because a lot of
folks want us to graduate as suckers oh
I feel like that's a good conversation
uhburnout is normal when you try reading
the book deep worker watching YouTube
vid on yeah do you work by Cal Looper is
fantastic I recently watched a video
where he covered this thing of called
the I think it's like it's like it's a
concept of Cycles where you're working
really hard for six weeks you take two
weeks off six weeks two weeks off or you
know replace six weeks with whatever you
feel is appropriate maybe it's six
months two months off something like
that
um I think it's an interesting concept I
know that it's difficult if you aren't
sort of your own boss or in charge of
your own schedule so whatever that looks
like for you go and give it a try also
it's on his YouTube channel Cal now it's
well it's his podcast it's also a
YouTube channel
um
but I like the idea of like going hard
for a amount of time taking some kind of
break going hard time to break hard
something like that so keep that in mind
I really do think it's all about
having activities or having priorities
outside of work that you are constantly
like doing something towards so whether
that be
um like your partner your family your
video games like before I was dating
someone I used to play a lot of video
games
and I really love open world video games
because it like really takes you out of
like your current reality and like go
you go in like a different you know
you're a character in a whole different
world I think it's cool
that would take me away from work and it
would be awesome just an hour of like
doing nothing but being in this whole
completely different world
but find something maybe you read maybe
you play guitar I don't know I also
think something that has some sort of
progression is pretty cool because then
then you know the momentum is awesome it
makes you keep wanting to come back and
back
um couldn't agree more that's why
they're intentionally failing at keeping
financial literacy out okay fair
but what I will also say is it's pretty
easy to find Financial
information nowadays
but yes it should still be taught in
high schoolhow much did how much should I spend to
get the expert level in Cloud what does
that mean
don't understand what that question got
a head outside over in English to be
sending you all love hope it works out
for all you
thanks Scott thanks for hanging out have
a good one
um
cat just wants to learn cloud is okay
yeah
she's always around uh cloud is very
wide yeah
let's see
might be a dumb question but I know
Python and cball plus the extent of oop
and I follow your six month plan to
build that skill set and then don't want
to go into cloud with those skills be
transferable
yeah of course because you're learning
um
if you already have programming
knowledge then you're going to learn
bash you're going to learn networking
fundamentals you're going to learn Cloud
fundamentals which is important for I
think any engineering aspect just under
having like a solid understanding of
cloud is always going to be a benefit if
it's not your main focus and then devops
fundamentals
uh maybe some of the devops stuff like
containers won't be too relevant for
other roles outside of like SRE cloud
and devops but having an understanding
of everything I think is important
because ultimately the cloud is just
where something
deployed to rightuh yes correct I don't like mechanical
keyboards either yeahremote jobs are definitely getting
harder to find but still more available
than pre-covered yeah definitely
um
pre-covered them oh no I worked for a
cloud Guru that was fully remote before
that in the cloud engineered gig I
worked at a SMB
and that was hybrid
at the most working two times two days a
week at homeI feel like I lost
yes do you use a Windows or Mac laptop
so I have a Windows desktop this is a
custom PC like the one that I kind of is
my primary machine I have a MacBook Pro
M1
and then I have my work laptop that is a
ThinkPad p14s
I don't use the MacBook as much it's
mainly for whenever I'm like at my
parents house or whenever I'm not home I
need to get work done
uh I will have that laptop on me for
thatby the time I finish work I'm too tired
to apply for jobs any advice
not really like if you want to get a job
you got to apply like what what kind of
what else kind of advice can I can I
give to you[Music]
um
replaying some Witcher 3 now with Ray
tracing good times I'm replaying uh days
gone I loved I played days gone on PS4
uh I loved that game when it came out I
think it was like 2018 and I was so sad
that it didn't get
like people were giving it bad reviews
for some reason and I could not
understand because
it is just such a lovely game and then I
just recently got it for PC I got it for
two dollars no no hold on
I got it for twenty dollars because I
bought I bought uh days gone and I
bought Sleeping Dogs on Steam for 22.
they were both on sale
and I just been playing that game again
I such a good game just riding the
motorcycle
through the world
love itsee now people are asking Finance
questions that I don't want to be giving
my opinions on MIT finest course is
amazing and free on YouTube there we go
that's a good resource go and check that
out
ummy heart really goes out to those here
at work visas no way they could have
seen layups coming like this yeah like
their status depends on that
stuff
toughyeah
it's 3 30 here in Pakistan thank you so
much for time to go and hope you retain
your job
um with Microsoft losses thank you
appreciate the support there
been playing days gone at PC and loving
it so far I wish there was open
um
not a co-op
because there's Co-op for I play Dying
Light with my brother Dying Light to
co-op with my brother loved it it made
the experience so much
I enjoyed the the game experience so
much more in Co-op
obviously it's like a bonding kind of
thing with my my sibling uh because we
both really like video games but I wish
there was more co-op games like that
we'll see what 2023 has in store
Dying Light one and two were fun yeah
great gamesI forgot I have these going probably the
same sale oh I need to go play that it's
a great game where did you get that hat
uh let me find it it's by Mark doiker
uh
he has like this store where he makes
uh he makes let's see
bye okay here we goI got it here let me paste it in the
chatthis this is where I got the Hat they
have a bunch of t-shirts too
I had hope for the day before but it's
not looking good the day before is that
game that everyone says doesn't really
exist rightand like they had hype around some sort
of trailer that they were gonna release
or some sort of Nvidia thing that was
gonna release
um like at the beginning of the month
but it just ended up being like a vlog
or behind the scenes kind of thing
yeah see those kind of those kind of
things are like sketchy to me because
it's like
when there's like so much hype up front
it worries me because I think cyberpunk
did it to everyone where everyone just
worries about like oh if it's if there's
a lot of hype and it looks promising
then it's gonna let us down kind of
thingso
also whenever I get a notification from
Outlook I'm just like
a freaking
anxious mess or teams like today I've
just been like oh my goodness what it's
my turn this morning I got a meeting
invite
umfrom a sync uh from someone and I was
like oh no this is the end but they were
just moving the time of a sink that we
had in their first place
so yeah I don't know it's like on edge
kind of thing it's kind of crazy I try
to pride myself in being
somewhat stoic with these types of
things but even then it's toughuh
day before was way too ambitious what
the small team it has so no surprise
honestly
it looks so cool though it looks like
everything I want in a video game but
hmm
HBS glad you're speaking on this when a
when I heard the news I thought of you
this environment reminds me of the first
web crash but this industry is so much
more mature
see I was talking to my again the the I
released the interview with Kathy Lee a
senior Cloud solution architect at
Microsoft and she was
she worked during the dot.com boom went
through the.com crash one through 2008
recession layoffs in like the mid 2010s
now
and she told me it seems it feels a lot
similar
um and I think the biggest piece of
advice she's like just keep in mind like
we don't know when this is gonna endoh goodness uhso yeah that's where that's ateveryone's doing a favor hit a like we
were trying to hit 100 live viewers
if we can hit that 100 I'd be so happy
that'd make my day that would help me
recover from
uh
a day filled with layoff newsGod of w God of War I'm assuming I've
heard good things but I feel like I
can't I don't really like
I don't know my type of video games like
open world type games is very like
distinct like I like Sleeping Dogs I
like GTA I like
um days gone the far some of the fry
cries far crys three four five amazing
Far Cry 6 not too not a big fan
umyeah those type of open World Games
Dying Light but then things like like
God of War I I don't know maybe it's
like the type of story I'm not a big fan
of
um but then again I liked Zelda which I
feel is like sort of like
it's not similar but it's uh
what's like what's the type of like
story
not medieval
sort of I don't know has like so many
different influences
I'm very hit or miss with the types of
games I like not sure why I think the
story I like the story to be like this
is almost possible for to happen to you
but not really
but like something like a zombie a cup
apocalypse could be very possible so
maybe that's whyhey GPS learning some python for the
next few weeks months wish me luck
awesome
it's never a bad idea never a bad idea
to Learn Python
oh Red Dead Redemption that's another
good game tooI only got a war but I will never get
over the fact that it somehow beat Red
Dead 2 in 2008. what a good game oh my
goodness Red Dead Redemption I just
watched this video on YouTube about this
um
I watched the weirdest video game be uh
video game videos on YouTube like I once
watched this video about how long you
can carry a bowl of soup in Reddit
Redemption without dropping it
was fascinating
um but then I also watched this video
today about how there's this group or
this clan in Red Dead Redemption called
the Reapers or something like that and
they're like just a bunch of people who
are very disciplined in the online game
and they have rules and it's really
strict to get into
fascinating so fascinatingI remember your early videos it's crazy
to see the progression thank you
appreciate that I've been trying to
oftentimes I do want to quit YouTube I'm
not gonna lie like the past two months
I've just been like why am I doing this
um but I'm still here
so trying to make some progress Fallout
New Vegasuh Watch Dogs yes I played Watchdogs too
I loved it the Watchdogs the one where
they did the switching characters I felt
like the switching characters brought no
like no benefit to the game but the game
was still cool it was gorgeous as well I
very much like the futuristic Vibe very
cool
Watch Dogs 2 was the best in my opinion
um
but yeah we'll see I don't know are they
continuing that game are they doing more
I don't remember 100hearing lots of good reviews for
Starfield another game that I'm
interested in
yes yes
uhplus there's efficiency wave it needs to
shake out AI engine being sued by Getty
Images I saw that I think I saw it today
what I think it was the uh was it that
lensa app that was getting sued I can't
remember 100 who it was
Last of Us yes I played the I played
some of it I know they had like a
remastered version
of was it the first one the second one I
can't remember
I didn't finish the whole thing because
I got creeped out by the what are they
called the clickers the those the
zombies in there I can't remember what
they're called got way too creeped out
but then now that I've played Dying
Light and days gone I feel like I can
come back and I'll be fine
of the jump scares to me
the jump scares to me sometimes get me
especially now that I played PC and it's
like the screen is right here and then
like I use like high quality headphones
like I could feel like I'm in the game
so it might be a little intense
sometimes Far Cry 345 is excellent like
six two
Far Cry 345
for me is my favorite it doesn't get a
lot of love but five has just a great
story
um
like six two but I can see where some
stuff got silly like it's Guardians of
the Galaxy or something also good
Horizon games
oh a dinosaur and a heart
thank you
Horizon games that's the one where you
have like you're in the past but also in
the future like the um
the the you have like robotic dinosaurs
right or robotic animals but you have
like uha caveman type attire that's that's that
one right I'm probably butchering this
description but my brother
my brother really likes the game the
soup Journey you need to watch this
video go go on YouTube and search how
long can you carry a bowl of soup in Red
Dead Redemption and you'll find the
video that I'm talking about this is the
stuff that I watch when I can't sleep at
like three in the morning
and uh and then I just send them to my
brother watch let me see what's the last
one is because I'm sure I saw something
and I was like I need to send this to my
brother
oh look like look this is the last one I
sent my brother is
counting every single tree in red Dem
Redemption 2.uh also let me see here
oh I sent him the trailer for the day
before
oh no he sent it to me originally he's
like check this out
let me see here I'm pretty sure I have
like more videos of that I've sent him
like yeah this is a random stuff I watch
at three in the morning uh we talked
about the cup
oh is there a way to see all your links
in
yes here we gotheoh these are like a lot of music videosokay I can't see anything now but go
check that outWatch Dogs Legion ended support only a
year after being out due to poor knit
player number oh I didn't Legion that's
what it was called I didn't know that
that sucksthat was I mean it was an interesting
game but it was just doing too much for
no reason
Baldur's Gate three or two my favorite
game I have to check out Starfield
is that out already I think I saw some
sort ofumlike I just Googled sarfield and says
Microsoft layoffs include gaming units
behind Halo Starfield
ohyou guys not out yet
first new universe in 25 years Bethesda
Cole yeah I think I saw like a teaser
trailer or something like thatplease don't quit I've been watching
videos for a while very inspired thank
you appreciate that
super skeptical surfing especially after
the last Fallout what I uh I don't I I
never played any Fallout games so no
context there but I know there was a lot
of like
hate around umthe lot like I think was the last one or
the last two something like that
Last of Us show is coming out on HBO
it's insane looking I'll have to take a
look I don't watch a lot of TVI'll watch the office I'll watch YouTube
and then the rest is just like video
games or doing some kind of other thing
I kind of miss playing videos of control
or but I just can't go back after using
keyboard for so long I use um
Xbox controller
I know everyone says that if you play in
a PC you should play with keyboard but
um prior to playing PC I've always
played PlayStation so using a controller
is like
this I don't know it's just more
comfortable I don't really care about
being super accurate or anything like
that plus um I play like FIFA and 2K a
lot uh so for matches like
you can't be a controller for that
so yellen's
Cloud Atlas meets Jurassic Park yeah
what
HBS being kidino Santa Maria just want
to say thank you for uploading your Kyle
videos I'm learning a lot watching from
New Zealand hey thank you very much
appreciate that I can't wait I can't
wait to take your bash course and I love
your blog post but I lost the link to
the bash course can you please listen
bash course is not out yet we're about
50 done uh all recording and stuff is
gonna be wrapped up by the end of this
week then it goes on to the editor
um and a couple of other kind of details
we have to get going and then it'll be
released I'm aiming for that to be
released
first or second week of February but it
might get pushed for marketing stuff but
as always I'll keep everyone up to date
with what's going on there right now
it's looking like it's about 20 to 25
videos from five to ten minutes long
we're covering a lot of stuff we're
covering I mean just the stuff that I
recorded today we're doing
uh sorry like what is a script variables
conditional statements case statements
Loops uh while until uh functions
putting all together uh in a script
we're covering what is a terminal uh how
to set up the the the environment
recovering uh changing permissions
recovering redirection pipelines uh oh I
can't really think the rest of it um
there's a couple of other videos that
we're covering but there's a lot it's
everything you need to get started with
bash and I think it's probably enough
for like a junior Cloud admin skill set
um so it's going to be a great great
resource for that first step of uh
really becoming comfortable with a cloud
environment so once it's out I will make
sure to keep everyone updated but we're
about halfway there nowjust wanted to put out there that the
newest edition of the Python crash
course was polished a week ago oh nice
nice nice nice nice nice niceum
that is a fan that's a book right I can
remember that one alongside the python
what's it called python for no it's not
python for beginners that's the
Microsoft series
python
oh my goodness what's the other book The
really popular python book
it's python crash course and I can't
remember the other one
umso when are we getting Kevin on for
another set of Ms demos Kevin
bicep Kevin I shouldn't call him bicep
cabin but we did bicep stuff together
uh I don't know I'll have to ask what's
he what's he's up to
the first episode aired and was really
good apparently I'll have to check it
outsome games doesn't work for keyword yep
exactly
need that aim assistuh hey Daryl Thanks For Shame and infos
what's up what's going on
what game mode do you play on FIFA I
don't know the middle one what is that
Pro
I can't remember what it is automate the
boring that's the book I'm talking about
yes automate the boring this is the
other book
uh
but I don't have the latest FIFA I have
like
22.
20 that's 23 is the latest one I don't
have the latest one
and I don't play online because I don't
want to get owned by 12 year olds I just
play like
classic matches well it's kind of fun
though I used to play with olive and
Richard we haven't done that in a while
GPS your medical keep doing what you do
thank you appreciate thatuh
the automated Python the Hard Way that's
one too but it's the one I'm thinking
about is automate the boring stuff
because they're both by
um
what is the yellow books publisher
calleduh I can't remember but that's the one
I'm talking abouthey Glenn I just wondering for myself
I'm doing some RCA and Incident
Management stuff recently was wanting to
know how well that translates to
something like a cloud engineering
position
Incident Management stuff I don't know
what RCA is
because someone told me about RC I could
Google like this what is RCAuh root cause analysis okay cool recalls
analysis
uh I want to know what that translate to
something like Cloud engineer position
and Incident Management stuff
what part
what part of a Houston Cloud engineerhow much what's your current experience
with what you do now like a couple yearsI could see it like maybe in like a
niche
Maybeuh maybe admin type stuff maybe maybe
even security related type stuff depends
on what your current skill set is
what update yeah automate the boring
that's the one I'm talking about
yes no search Press thank you day they
they're the ones that make the yellow
ones the yellow books it's uh also the
um
what's that Linux book that I love so
much Linux basic for hackers I love that
book so much it's also by Northstar
press
I feel like they they have just like
such quality books and pretty affordable
as well
highly recommend
no no not the dummies not the dummies no
starch no starch
the dummies ones are not always yellow
right I think there's different colors
for that one or are they always yellow
but I'm talking about no search pressGPS working on Microsoft yep still at
Microsoft year and a half I mean I
haven't gotten a layoff notice today so
as of right now
as of right now I still work here yeah
yeah yeah yeah so I don't know we'll man
I don't know when I'll be able to like
let go of like let go sorry relief and
be like I'm not laid off but I know that
I can feel that way today until I start
work tomorrow
so there's that but yeah sell Microsoft
a year root cause analysis a year
um is that like can you tell me a little
bit of like tools that you use I'm not
very familiar with it but if you let me
know what kind of like
uh
Services tools that you can deal with in
this role I can probably give you a
better idea
um but I want to lean into saying like
it might be something security or
identity based which is good
yeah yeah Cloud sec I'm leaning it's a
potentially Cloud SEC but not on
uh stuff like uh what is it
azure
Sentinel uh there's this other one I'm
thinking I can't remember what it's
called
type service
I did RC engine management as the cloud
UPS team so it depends company to
company yeah
they're always yellow idiot's guide is
orange oh I didn't know the rose yellow
I agree currently reading how Linux
Works Linux basic for hackers next
howlinx works is a great book as well
um if you want to have a better
understanding of the operating system
the kernel
solid book I need to reread it for a
couple of streams that I'm doing in
Februarydated dog oh damn you should talk today
is a data dog uh a data dogger
sorry today Bay is a security engineer
at oh no detection engineer a data dog
uh so if your skill is to use datadog
Microsoft Defender yes that is what I'm
talking about Microsoft Defender
uh but yeah you could probably get into
something like Cloud security
uh Microsoft Defender and Sentinel were
the services that I was talking about
I think what you're I mean datadog is
very cloud-based uh yeah that skill set
you could I mean unless you don't want
to get into securityuh I'm a data dog yeah day is a data
dogger he has a YouTube channel if you
go to day cyber walks on YouTube You'll
Find all this information and all his uhvideos and whatnot on on cloud security
but I have a feeling do you not want to
get into security
is that why you're trying to get into
Cloud engineering if you know your way
around so observability is a big thing
right
so I'm assuming if you use something
like datadog you have some skill set
with understanding monitoring and
observability
which is a big part of successful cloud
architecturesumso you would have to couple that with
whatever any other thing you want what I
mean what Niche you want to get into so
you need to couple that it's like a big
part of it but not
do you have any like programming skillsyeah we're mostly in the cloud all right
so I feel like you're on a wayuh other data dog EPM traces are crucial
for fixing a broken app
days man check them out yeahcheck them out my background is mostly
second networking okay so you have
networking you have observability
probably need some if you have some
scripting experience you have some
programming experience if you have that
and you are familiar do you have you
worked inside of a cloud platform like
have you used something like AWS Azure
before you might have everything you
need you just need to probably like
maybe get a project or two so you can
further understand that skill set tailor
their resume and cover letter you're
probably good plus you have experience
that's the hardest thing for people to
get
um
learning react and JavaScript a bunch
Okay soyou don't need react in JavaScript
unless you want to be a web developer uh
in the cloud you don't really need it
like unless you want to be a cloud
developer but even then they're so more
focused on making like Cloud native
applications and a lot of that is like
back-end stuff uh which probably isn't
reacting JavaScript I mean I know you
can use these both front-end and back
end but they're not really primarily
made for that
umso you might want to look into something
like python or
go or dot net
like that
what a chat we're about to hit 60. do me
a favor hit a like let's hit I still
want to hit 100. I have big goals people
I have big goals and Big Dreams uh so
yeahwhat up Ethan how you doingwell I got an emailI'm on high alert chatcurious if you're consider doing update
version average Cloud resume.net through
was retired in December so following
your God it's a bit tricky on my GitHub
I have updated version I've done it six
I don't know if I've done it seven I've
done it six so the.net version I have an
updated uh my guide my repo itself is
using.net sex
um
I unfortunately don't have the ability
to edit like the blog post or the
YouTube video or on the cloud resume but
the.net code has been updated in my
repos if you check it outum
I don't think I would do an update like
a whole version of it thoughhumble bone bill has great Book Sales I
think I once saw the combo of the Linux
command line uh Linux basic for hackers
and how Linux works that there's three
that is like the trio that you need for
Linux uh I saw that once on sale but I
had the books already before so I had to
buy it but I share that to everyone this
was a couple months ago so there's no
way that it's a thing anymore but those
three books honestly if you pick those I
mean I think individually they're like
20 to 25 dollars recommend so much it's
been those time like times going through
all those books you'll have such a solid
knowledge with bash and Linux highly
recommendsuper Niche thing making an Azure devops
UA space extension nowadays in react but
that's super Niche skill set yeah super
nicheuh super super Niche I feel like
I I could see that beinga helpful
but also I don't knowI haven't heard of any company like
trying like the need for thatbut then again
I also worked on like a portal that was
sort of like a UI for SQL
so and then some people would be like
why you don't need a UI for that but
they needed it in this case so it was
madeshould web developers learn Cloud yeah
100 because where do your web apps end
up
in some kind of cloud technology
doesn't have to be AWS Azure gcp but
it'd have to be somewhere right
so just understanding like you know what
is a successful Cloud app look like it's
important you don't necessarily have to
be like certified though it would help I
thinkit's trying to move from service desk to
Azure still trying to figure out my path
bit by bit path bit path but
your videos are really helpful thank you
appreciate thatnetwork engineer with some sprinkle of
security too I want to move to cloud and
maybe even devops for remote work
especially working from oversea like
Europe
um or Southern East Asia possibleokay so I mentioned this at the
beginning but
uh hold on let me just text me
you can come get it if you need toso I mentioned the remote aspect of any
role has nothing to do with the role
itself it's more or the industry itself
it's more company company you can work
in the tech industry which is remote
friendly but work at a company that
doesn't allow you to work remotely
that's more a team thing organization
team thing company thing it's not
specific to the role itself Cloud roles
can be done remotely but not are not all
are done by that there's going to be a
bunch of reasons why a company would or
would not want to be a remote uh some of
them make sense some of them might not
some of them may be fair some of they
might not I'm not here to
judge that but it's more so like
you know when you're applying to a role
ask that question or maybe it's in the
description or maybe you can find other
people talking about that role or
something like thatit was very helpful for when people
folks are trying to do git flow across
15 repos like it was asafe delivery train or something needed
to create branches appear as a
coordinate anyway each time I made that
that's cool
sounds like umum
I know like GitHub has a pretty good UI
for that
so pretty interestingsad news to all those have been affected
you will get through this yeah I mean we
need to send positive vibes
one thing I will say is that if I do get
laid off I'll definitely stream
but I don't expect me to be like I can't
believe I got laid off this is BS no
um you're never going to see that kind
of emotion out of me publicly privately
perhaps but that's between
the people that I know in person and
privately but on stream no but I I feel
like if I'm
doing a live stream
when it hasn't happened to me but sort
of like having some space for other
people to talk and if it does happen to
me I should do it as well it's like when
I failed my certificate like Linus
certification like I was
upset but I felt like sharing it was
also as important as sharing the failure
was
feeling the bad news was as important as
sharing the good newsthey just sub nice
look at youbetween you and your cat yeah the cat
the cat knows all the secrets the cat
cat my partner are the ones who always
find out oh my emotions firstI gotta get a click bait laid off from
Microsoft yeah you're gonna see me being
like it's gonna say like I was laid off
from Microsoft and it's gonna be me and
like I don't know like a pose like like
this or like maybe there's like a
teardrop or something like that
foreign
something like that
sometimes I do think of like oh what
would I do if I got laid off
um would be an interesting uh scenario
for sure it's not like I'm hoping it
happens or I look forward to it
definitely not but
I like to believe that I have the type
of character that will
always figure whatever happens out so
if anything it's just another experience
rightyeah red arrows everywhere like
I don't know like the Microsoft logo and
like an X or like a thumbs down
something like thatbest way to learn git GitHub
um
personal projects like
even if you are the only person working
on a project like you should have good
good practices using branches and things
like that committing your code uh no
matter what you should have it in some
sort of git Repository
online get request sorry
well there are a bunch of resources out
there too yeah
uh free code Camp has a good video John
says that Daryl says mosh has a good
GitHub video too
a lot of programming books will teach
you git as well like I know the python
crash course and automate the boring I
have some git lessons in them
uh so yeah
if you do the cloud resume you
definitely need to have get in GitHub
uh skill set there
so there's that
I earlier on I went through a bunch of
questionsyou have some so you have some AWS
experience just go back to Austin some
AWS experience some programming
experience some
observability experience you kind of
every little piece I think you probably
have to couple that with a little bit
more of like other areas Cloud so
um like understanding different compute
options maybe do like do the cloud
resume that'll give you a good feel for
uh different types of services in the
cloud uh should be good thereuh maybe a project or two would be good
just watched your CSA video with Kathy
do you know anyone on the technical CSA
networking not a certain engineer CSA
that you could interview as well
you know anyone on the technical CSA not
software Engineers you say that you can
interview as well
you like someone who does networking as
a CSAprobably I'll ask Kathy to tell me one
of her colleagues who I can interview
so
I think her whole team is software
Engineers though
so that might not be the right
and then I would have to go poke around
to see csas that are not sales
that implement but do networking
um I would have to go see or may she
might have
members on her team that
have a strength in networking but
they're all software engineersdid you mention Consulting as possible
option A while back if you were laid off
you could do that too maybe in your
freelance yeah maybeput I don't know
I'm at an interesting point in my career
where it's like I don't know what the
next step is regardless ofum
regardless of layoff happening or not so
I've been in my role like a year almost
an hour a year anda year and six months uh
and around this time is where I
historically have been like okay what's
the next moveum so yeah I don't really know part of
me wants to go back to like a cloud
engineer gig
part of me wants to try something new
like a cloud social architect role I
just don't want to do anything with
sales so that's a little tricky finding
those kinds of roles part of me wants to
stay in advocacy and just move up the
ranks there
umpart of me wants to take a break
I would lie if I if I didn't mention
that
um
yeah I don't know I don't know what's
next I really really don't
um
I guess that's why it's great and it's
also to be in a it's a better position
to be in where like you're trying to
figure that out now
um with while being employed
um then trying to figure it out when you
you're not employed definitely
um yeah I don't know
because something sounds interesting
um
but it's just not I don't know we'll
have to seeyou will be you'll be excellent at sales
Maybe
my um
my mom told me the other day that I
could sell salt salt to a slug which I
find an interesting thing to say about
me butI don't know it's just not something
that I'm very much interested in I
but it could be so I don't know
a bunch of Auto knows today
I like I I think I would love to be on
something similar to what Kathy does
like this
it was really loud bike outside and my
windows open
um like a class solution architect that
is implementing an engineering not doing
sales because we're hitting quotas is
just something that I don't want to doit's just don't
that's just nothing I don't want to
worry about especially with the maybe
when the economy is great maybe
cool but no I just
not something
it says about building relationship
relationship building and you're doing
it here yeah that's what I'm saying I'm
already doing it here I don't want to do
it for workyeahuh let's seetaking a look at what I skipped hereumI think I got all of these questions I
think earlier on I might have skipped
because I was like flying through them
all right I'm gonna go back
yeah it was very stressful and someone
over to control which is the sucky part
yeahbut then there's the flip side of that
if you make one sale that hits your
quota then you're like goodright
um
which I guess if you're really good at
then it could be something beneficial
but
it's not something I
look forward to it's not something that
I wake up like oh I want to do that
versus like going back to Cloud
engineering or going into
um software engineer type CSA like those
things I look forward to but maybe it's
because I'm familiar with those things
maybe it's because it's the unknown that
I'm like oh I don't know
I'll be like my I feel like that my
long-term goal is to be open
is to open my own kind of development
company I would love to open
I would I mean honestly dream dream
would be to turn learn to Cloud into
something that somehow makes money
um without
closing the the educational material
I don't know what that looks like
um
like I wanted to be free for people to
learn but it somehow makes money but I
don't know what that looks like uh
yeah so I don't know we'll seedo you need to learn scripting before
taking any cloud training
the murder the majority of people in
course makers will probably tell you no
but I think yes
I think knowing bash for cloud is
essential absolutely essential which is
why I'm making a bash course which will
be free so I'm not trying to sell you
anything
it's going to be on YouTube
quota meeting stress is real yeah
especially like at the last like what if
you don't hit it and you're like the
last week then you're like gonna end up
trying to sell anything
thoughts on this being an I.T is like
playing through an RPG as one class
build soldier for example and realizing
later that you should have been a wizardyeah oh my goodnessand then you can and then like your
player can be killed off for no reason
killed because it's the analogy of a
video game but in this context I mean
like late being laid off as in like you
removed from your career for whatever
reasonit's kind of crazy like this is like the
stuff that we put ourselves because
layoffs are not anything new right
layout stuff's always happened but it's
kind of crazy that we like
there are periods where this is just
happens like it's like a part
of the the jobit looks like millions of pop-up ads oh
my goodnessWildscripting is including the cloud pilot
is super useful plus it'll make learning
programming easier because program it is
probably yeah scripting is programming
because you have variables functions
Loops uh conditions which is all the
basics of programming then you have to
put something like well I guess depends
on the type of programming but the most
one of the most popular ones object
oriented programming which you can learn
with something with like little language
after bash but even being able to do
simple like redirection or pipelines or
so putting commands together it's very
useful in the context of like a cloud
CLI
so yeah there's that
how do you learn new things at this
level when you're career factoring and
the fear of the unknown I don't know I
feel like a lot of what I learned now is
more so a lot very much aligned with
what I'm doing currently but at the same
time it's stuff that I would I could
potentially see myself doing long term
like for example it's like a lot like
this this month with bash like upgrading
my bash skills um
and then next month is a lot of like
operating system Linux type stuff uh so
how Linux runs in Azure how Linux works
and like an overview of WSL like that's
kind of like the focus for this month of
next month but I also think those skills
are something that I'm going to be able
to use no matter what I do next like if
I want to be uh in advocacy but specific
to open source and Linux then this will
be uh important for that like if you all
saw the interview that I did today with
Kathy Lee like she mentioned that bash
is something she used every single day
as a class solution architect so me
upskilling there is great as well I
definitely want to do some more
containers and kubernetes stuff because
she also mentioned that kubernetes is
just something that she sees and the
majority of her in customer engagements
so I'm definitely upskilling in that but
I like to think of like I guess that's a
good thing about my current role is the
flexibility to kind of upskill whatever
I want
um but then that's also like you have
the what's what is it called the Paradox
of choice where you can choose anything
so it makes it more difficult
yeah
um
I guess that's how I do itoh hold on what was this I think it's
just keeping up keeping up emerging
Technologies somewhat I did this video
about habits
that I set my goal for what I want to
learn so like I mentioned bash this
month
operating system Linux next month
um and then I stick to that if if like a
new like the new ladies and greatest
Cloud thing comes out next week like
I'll read about it like I'll I listen to
podcasts like I listen to the cloud cast
and a couple other podcasts that kind of
keep me informed but I don't go in
Russian do tutorials on them because I
find that once the hype is down and then
you go and revisit these topics it makes
a lot
it's a lot more sense and oftentimes you
realize like it wasn't really worth
investing that much time into that
so I like to have like a plan decided in
like three months in advance or three
months at a time
um
that way I'm not pulling a billion other
directions all the time
I don't work at Cloud at all but from
what I research I believe you're
thinking Pi Than A bash need for
automation I think that gets used yep
100.
to maximum employees know if they have
been laid off yet and if so which roles
are hit the most I don't know
I I don't know
uh are we getting I know some people
know and that they've and I not only
know that because they've been sharing
on like social media
are we getting to a point though where
AI will start to become a serious threat
yeah
that's so I mean yeah I I think right
now the immediate kind of opportunity is
people understanding how to leverage it
um but you know there's no avoiding
that's going to automate some kind of
roles I don't know what but it
definitely willread income while keeping content free
Dr Chuck
and his python for everyone of course
has managed to do that you can pay for
the course on Coursera I'll watch it
minus a few things on YouTube
yeah that's
that's an interesting play I don't want
to make courses thoughyeah that's the thing I don't I don't
have much interest in making courses
even though everyone tells me make a
course make a course even my partner the
other day was like make a course
should make a course
I don't want to make a course
I'm making this bash course
but I don't I don't want my course to be
my
income or my profession because then
it's like
that's what I have to spend my time
doing like updating my course like like
or my courses or whatever like that's
not what I want to do not now at least
sometime in the future maybe but not nowI'm going to hurt clashing your job
should I put previous offer to build
jobs Myers my one thousand percent
I have four years experience in Cloud
engineer
wait what
you're already a cloud engineer you're
going for a college in your job
I'm a little confused thereto me and I have four years experience
in a software engineer job
well I worked at helpless I was already
seeing things like Microsoft autopilot
being rolled out the only jobs to worry
about repetitive ones
always be upskilling do Azure service
run at the Linux
do Azure servers Run online Linux oh
like what makes up of azure like
what Azure runs on yeah most likely like
things like um
AKs after kubernetes service runs on
Linux runs on our own Dish show it's
called
um
what's called Mariner something like
that I'm probably not pronouncing it
correctly
um
yeah so that runs on that in AKs is a
big part of azure I'm sure there's a lot
more and I know there's a lot of Linux
workloads like over 50 of of compute in
Azure that is deployed on Azure is Linux
and this was something that I saw back
from back from 2020 so three years now
that's definitely way up there I don't
know maybe 60 65 percentcan I get an email notifications of your
Live Events yeah you have to hit the
little like on my channel you can put
notifications and then you put all
notifications and then that'll give an
email whenever I go livethat being said help desk will not be
fully replaced to certain aspects of it
allowing to promise to downside their
apartmentyes correctuh
what up Kev
make a course one of us no I don't want
to make a course not now later maybe
maybe next year or something I don't
know
how come Microsoft doesn't create its
own limit we do have our own Linux
position it's called let me let me look
at it Microsoft MarinerCBL Mariner
here it is
this is what powers AKsboomyou mentioned not going to content
creation full time in a previous live
stream but you also talked about being
an educator which you already are would
you ever consider doing that
uh yeah teaching maybe but then I feel
like that goes back to like
making a course
uh I don't think I'd ever be like a
traditional teacher just because I would
have to go to school I would have to
like
get a bachelor's and then get like
continue like a Masters or something to
teach at like certain schools
umso if anything maybe it'd be like a
full-time YouTuber but I don't really
have any interest in that either
honestly if I were to if I were not to
do the roles that I mentioned already
being interested in I would love to like
live off Investments or live off or go
to a farm and live there or something
like thatwhat search should I get before I try to
get my Azure shirt
uh Linux Essentialsand the Azure do the 104 so you get some
networking experience too that's the
Linux to showthat powers Azure kubernetes serviceuh let's seeQuinn if sitting for an interview for an
entry-level Cloud role an interview
looks at credentials in your opinion
which you think would be more impressive
a plus a Linux
all day lfcs is a hard one I failed that
one
I didn't pass and then I went for the
essentials because the essentials is
more than enough for like basic Cloud
role
heck yeah a plus
also isn't CompTIA like raising their
prices also we hit 70 live viewers
appreciate y'all let's go 30 more to 100
let's go
okay like hit me with a like on the
Stream
let's try to hit 100 we're at 70 right
nowLinux Foundation certified system
administrator that's what that stands
for right
solid solidification
one thousand percent more useful than a
plus also a plus is Raising its prices I
saw that I think Kev Tech shared that
crazy it's already pretty expensive
I don't see this is a hot take don't
hate me but I do not see how any of the
concierge are worth it for cloud for
other roles potentially for cloud I just
don't see it
I just don't see it I don't think I
could do teaching as I worry about
growing out of touch of the industry yes
oh my goodness thank you this is why I
don't want to be a full-time YouTuber or
dedicate my time to making courses all
the time because
if I can't get Hands-On firsthand
experience with customers or Solutions
or production
how am I supposed to stay in
stay updated with stuff right now what
I'm trying to do and what I'm actually
doing now is
making learn a cloud a full Cloud native
in production application and it's
already
but let's take a look here hold on let
me show you my screenuh learn to Cloudwait I was gonna go to the portal hold
onuh
present share screen share screen
this yearall right so learn to cloud in the last
this is five minutes has 807 sight hits
and let's take a look at the resource
Group
and let's take a look at the cost
analysisso so far
we havecome on third oh no it's gonna hit forty
dollars so rishab was right he said that
this is this number is going to be
closer to 50 by the end of the
the end of the month I said around I
think I said around 30 sorry my
estimation is already done so far it's
called 7.19 to have this deployed in
Azure uh learn the cloud but anyway my
goal my goal is
to build learn to Cloud into a full
Cloud native in production it's already
in production but it's not it's like
it's not 100 implemented everything that
I want uh that way when I do
sort of do more like educational things
that I'm building them off and in
production app that I maintain that I
build I'm essentially the cloud engineer
for this project and that way I will
always have sort of an in production app
to work with to work on because that is
my one issue like if I ever want to
become like a YouTuber full-time or
everyone to become a content creator of
the full-time something like that like
what will I work with in production
so that's what I'm trying towork on now for the future kind of thinguh where did I movethe concierge price hacks is what's
making me reconsider
crazy I think I mean they're already too
expensive I think computers only worth
if you're trying to break into specific
areas without formal education since
they are so well known I remember they
said you should get it they told me that
I should get a help desk to get helpless
dog health desk job I needed a plus and
I bought the a plus book and it was like
this massive book and then the first
couple chapters are like what is a mouse
what is a USB port and I was like F this
and then I just applied to a bunch of
helpless jobs
the thing about me is that I've always
been really good at interviewing so I
landed a role but I don't know I just
could not put myself through studying
that not saying there's anything wrong
with the certification just saying like
it's just something that I couldn't do
but I could see it being helpful for
sureuh is a CompTIA Linux plus an awsaa
enough to get a job uh Cloud job if I do
Hands-On Labs her experiences coming
from non-technical background uh maybe
uh why don't you want to do something
like a support role for like a year you
do a support role and you couple that
with projects and the certifications I
think you have a pretty solid chance
but coming completely from scratch is
you know you're up you're up with a lot
of people who are trying to transition
into clouds people who have other types
of technical experience so it's it's
tough right
the problem with con tip is that it's a
monopoly every company asks for CompTIA
a plus and the IT support I hope that's
Gary you can still get you can still get
hired with home labs yeah I mean it's
just been around longer
actually it's funny just before I left
my old job at an MSP my college
professor started working there on a
tenure so he doesn't get out of touch
but my college brother started working
there on a tenure so he does yeah see
I feel like it's tough to like not kind
of get out of touch if you're fully
dedicated to
creating technical content
yeahDaryl 100 Kevinborderline scam CompTIA man I also that
was the I I tell people the story all
the time I had negative 200 I remember
it so vividly I remember opening up my
Bank of America app on my phone
so vividly seeing negative two hundred
dollars and around this time was also
when I needed to pay for that Conti
assert because I didn't have a job and
and obviously no one would pay for it
and I was like there's no way I can
afford this
no way
uh yeah keeping up with industry is a
full-time YouTuber might be a big tricky
I'm still figuring out what up tag with
Lucy shout out Tech with Lucy I know
this is something that you're working on
now yeah
um just one of the reasons why I don't I
don't want to do it I I I I also really
do love the fact that I get to be on
kind of like random engineering projects
at Microsoft
um and it's cool you get to work with
different Engineers
um in terms of like you know leveling
your skill set up it's always great you
get to meet new people fantastic I just
feel likeI would isolate myself from a lot of
what I really do enjoy if I did content
full-time so
it's just not something for me now yeah
I was lucky to get my first help this
job without it I mainly got it because
everyone I would I would be working with
was trained under the same guyI Got A Plus network plus server plus
but when I read through job description
I feel like I don't know anything
sorry that was funny because because
it's like one of the realest comments
ever it's like you go and you study for
certifications and then you realize like
oh they're asking for something
completely differentyeah that's why I constantly tell people
like certifications and I I
certifications are not the answer they
just they just are not
they're not the answer to Landing a job
no their lands they're they're an answer
for some people to learn one thousand
percent but I feel like since there's
this whole there's this hole now
um industry around certifications uh
whether that be courses whether that be
boot camps whether that be like the
certification interesting in in it of
itself like people make money off of
this so the push to like get certified
get service get certified is because it
makes other people money now it also is
very useful for people who need like
very structured like an outline and I've
used certifications before 100 but I
just feel like because it's like
let's call it Big certification is
pushing you to go get more and more more
you spend less time really studying for
one deeply and mindfully where you end
up just memorizing and then when it goes
to kind of showcase your skill set you
don't really know
much because it's like oh you only like
studied in a quick fashionwhat I will say is if you have this
framework like the other day I posted on
on my community tab or it's like if you
do like like let's say you do like a
fundamental certification then you go
and do a project that builds off what
you learned there and then you go do a
certification like an associate level
certification that builds off that
previous project and then you go to a
project that builds off the associate
certification I think that is a
fantastic framework but that is
something that you cannot get done in
like a month or two months and another
issue is like you constantly see
YouTubers talking about like top paying
certifications you constantly see
LinkedIn posts it's like oh I just got
certified in every new week every week
they have a canoe certification a bunch
of stuff like that right
like it's like and
sort of the mindset we have around them
is like oh I need to do more and more
more where it's like no what you need to
do is couple them with other things
projects certifications awesome great
way better for your resume but alone
they really don't do much
I think I spent my first AWS
certification like it's my only AWS
certification which is my AWS certified
developer associate I took six months
like hold on let me show you guys this
let me show you that let me find this
first
um six months and I oh my goodness I
remember passing that certification and
because it had taken me so long I
remember walking out I remember that I
remember the the the place that I took
it was in like I don't know why it felt
like it was in the middle of this Forest
but Connecticut Everything feels like
it's in the middle of a forest the
parking lot it was so empty because I
took it later because they took it after
my help desk gig it was like six o'clock
and I remember running out of my car I
was like yeah my life is about to
change
um mainly because I like suffered a lot
um to study it but then again I don't
think you ever hear of someone saying
like oh I took six months to study of
her class certification now it's like
unheard of hold on I need to find this
I'm going to show you my notes
oh here we go I'm gonna show you so you
can see how long it took me to to study
because I'm not I'm not I'm not here to
lie to y'all
um
okay hold on
we're at 80 80 live years let's hit 100
people please
do me a favor and hit a like on that uh
stream oh hold on let me minimize this
I will do this we'll do this
all right take a look these are my AWS
CSA and I guess at some point I know CDA
and at some point I'd start
um
setting for the CSA uh and I guess I
heard that there's like a lot of overlap
right
so yeah this took me six months to put
together it's like an entire PDF let's
go to the bottom I don't remember how
many pages is in here 61 Pages y'all 61
pages of all my notes of just studying
for this darn certification I'm a big
Note Taker uh I've been using notion
since
it came out pretty much so I have this
available I have like even diagrams in
herewhere is it
like oh look at this I don't even
remember where I got this from I don't
remember where I took this from but
um
like it took me for I just remember
studying every single day two hours
after the darn help desk gig after
driving an hour
commuting because he obviously helped us
because not really well that helped us
gig wasn't really remote uh remote
friendlyI remember this also studying for the
certification was the first time that I
did stuff with like AWS Lambda and I was
like this is so cool
so I guess my serverless uh my
enthusiasm for serverless was even back
then later on I got like a bunch of
experience with Azure functions which is
great
um oh my goodnesssix six months y'all I signal is a notes
right here
can you imagine if I if I was worried
about making LinkedIn posts all the time
about studying I would have never been
able to put something like this together
I've never I don't I mean I probably
would have passed but
I feel like the social aspect of this
upskillings cloud is is this is a lot of
pressure on that to like make daily make
daily updates make daily daily videos
make oh like daily LinkedIn posts and
things like that and I just I'm so glad
that that wasn't what I had I had put
myself through when I was learning
because it would have just had me so
distracted don't get me wrong in my
cloud study plan let me find that too
made made by oh my goodness I can't top
my own made by GPS
six months Cloud study pan I do highly
recommend that you do a where is it I
factored in three days for each facial
documentation purposes use them but
that's after spending uh like in this
case two weeks on like your bash skill
set and then spending three days making
a video or making a blog post for the
networking Parts after spending two
weeks like it's not like every day uh
after python spending five weeks after
Cloud platform spending six weeks after
terraform spending two weeks after
Docker spending two weeks like
I factored in into this plan three days
at each phase to go and you do something
that synthesizes the information but
like doing it every day would have been
way too distracting way way too
distracting
uh let's see here
oh my goodness I talk so much that I
missed so many questions here
what up Nicholas how you doingI don't want to push CompTIA hate but I
just have such a sour taste for that
certification because
I couldn't afford it
getting out of the army I was told
definitely get SEC Plus for that special
shirt requirement DOD okay that's fair
certain government roles absolutely
require
uh certain certifications
but I I've never had any interest of
working on the government and especially
after talking to Kathy and she talks
about working for the government because
she's worked for the government and the
interview that it's on my YouTube
channel I'm like especially don't want
to work for the government after that
though
I could see why people love the
stability and kind of like will put up
with whatever the role requires for the
stability 100 is just something I have
no interest doing
did you get any type of four-year
college degree before working at Cloud
nope I am a College Dropout I did two
semesters of systems engineering in
Ecuador because I was living in Ecuador
at that time and then I dropped out and
then I moved back here to the USwhenever I feel I'm feeling lazy I watch
your videos for motivation oh well I'm
glad to be a source of motivation for
you
we're 16 away from 100 y'all do me a
favor hit a like on that let's get to
100.
I remember I don't know if anyone here
used to was subbed into my channel
really early on when I used to do live
streams and like two people would watch
two people three people would watch so
now the fact that I could potentially
reach 100 people watching while I'm just
sitting here talking about
stuff that I've been through when it
comes to this class stuff is insane but
I really do appreciate it so it's
freaking awesome guess on a day where
i'm like worried about being laid off
it's nice to have this kind of uh
support from such an awesome Community
I'm just checking my email again because
I just got a notification but it's not
my work email it's my personal email so
awesomesee I did a support role internship for
only two months and I've been working on
lots of projects and such I hope I can
break into Cloud scene
you got to be comfortable you gotta be
so comfortable with the rejection
I I did a video on the roles I rejected
on and I and after I did it and like
uploaded it I remember a bunch of other
roles that I forgot to add like the
Google one
but at some point when you when you stop
making the rejections personal you can
really learn a lot from them but more
importantly the patience in the
perseverance that you get from it
like 100 such a valuable lesson um but
just also understand thatit's just
everyone goes through it some people
will go through it more some people have
connections that help them land that
first role uh and whatever but yeah we
all go through it so if that helps you
feel a little less worse about it
hopefully
didn't know that competeers I didn't
know that about comptia's Linux plus how
does that compare to lfcs is that is
that like Network Plus versus czna in
terms of renown
I don't know how the Linux plus compares
to lfcs but I feel like the Linux
Foundation One do you get like a retake
I think you might get a retake on that
for the price
um again because my mindset with
certifications is it's not for having it
on my resume it's for which one is going
to teach me the the better like the
better stuff that's where I come fromwhat is a mouse or an essay yeah I
couldn't go through those questions I
could notclose is one of the Linux institution
shirts only also get you the Linux plus
since they are the same thing I didn't
know that
did not know that
got my net plus proportion points and
then SEC Plus for job applications and
went to get hired at a repair shop and
they said kick Rock whatwhat there's got to be some conspiracy
theory here with CompTIA
that's crazy how so you have sec plus
and net plus but because you don't have
a plus which I'm pretty sure SEC plus
and Netflix are way harder than a plus
you can't go for itI'm working in security and my team's
transitioning to Cloud what sir would
you recommend getting and working in
security transitioning Cloud security
wise the clouds the cloud cloud security
certifications right
um
go to day's Channel day cyber walks day
if you're in here drop your YouTube
channel
um
there he has certifications that he
recommends for people going in security
but if you're already in cloud and
moving into Cloud security probably one
of the specializations like there's like
the SC 900s sc200s for Azure I don't
know what the equivalents are in the
other clouds uh that will probably be of
better benefit to you
this is from someone from a military I.T
background if the organization is going
to cover the cause it's well worth the
CompTIA effect as it made each of my
interviewers see that I'm a solid CIS
admin ah interesting
if you can get it paid for might be
worth it but if you can get other
certifications paid forit's always likeyeah that's all I guess that's a tough
thing too is that I can recommend
something but it's not Universal it's
all my opinion
uh but if you think they're worth it and
you want to get them
see if someone else can pay for them
big facts there
started stacking with no skills is no
bueno factsuh
[Music]can't remember the last time I had to
pay for a certification where I didn't
get it paid back gotta start summer butt
grateful for this Pacers even my help
desk gig paid for certifications
one thousand percent which is I feel
like I'll there's a bunch of help desk
gigs out there that are very aware that
they are
roles like stepping stone rolls for
people so they do their best to treat
their people good and like pay them like
they helped us gig I think it was like a
thousand dollars a year that you can use
on books and courses and certifications
which is great so I use that to pay for
my AWS one
uh but yeah ask ask if you can get this
as a benefit also my sis admin gig
um I could I got Linux Academy paid by
my employer like they put it on their
credit card but they didn't have like an
official way of asking for this or like
submitting it somewhere
um so if you could just ask it's worth
it like
that the like very least what are you
gonna get like a no
what up Mike uh what are your favorite
programming languages
I mean I know the most csharp.net
so I guess that's my favoritea mouse is something Tom chases in ssds
isyeah they're paying for it so I'm
looking to Choose Wisely facts do your
research do your research
I would say
go for very targeted certifications for
sure
don't just go and get the ones that
people are like top 10 paying
certifications now do the ones that are
best gonna make most sense for you in
your career rightuh I got my SEC plus from the Air Force
oh thank you for your service uh the
other person who mentioned they were in
the military as well
um
for you too and the a plus Netflix from
going with oh going with for my
bachelor's at WGU I work as a semi now
but I like to work at solution learning
AWS or linuxb best Bash one thousand
percent no matter which Cloud you end up
learning but you had a bachelor's that's
great
and you have this Adam experience
fantastic do you have do you do any do
you do any Powershell as a sysadmin
or bash as a CIS admin
but yeah I usually recommend so to kind
of be like
uh have a solid foundation for a cloud
skill set it's it's bash networking
scripting oh wait no batch of scripting
bash networking programming Cloud
platform DeVos fundamentals that will
give you a well-rounded curriculum to go
and Conquer your first Cloud admin role
Cloud engineer role
um entry level cloud role whatever they
call them againwhich is why that's why I learned a
cloud is is divided up in that so if you
all are not familiar let me share my
screen again
I feel like the majority of people are
probably familiar with it in the first
place but uh
switch here switch here
this is not learning cloud
learn to Cloud this is learn to Cloud
this is the open source Guide to the
fundamentals of cloud computing uh
powered by Azure now
shout out to my current employer
someone asked me the other day like if
you worked for AWS or gcp would you end
up moving learn to Cloud to them and
honestly probably because I would get
free credits and then I wouldn't have to
pay for it so
we'll see but anyway learn to cloud is
exactly what it says here it's a guide
uh in the goal is to provide an outline
of skills you will need to learn to get
into cloud computing so that's why the
phases are if you're starting from
absolutely no Tech experience here or
tech knowledge
um
about networking programming Club
platform Davison rentals Cloud security
fundamentals uh learn to cloud.guide is
the website and then this will tell you
everything you need to know so for
example phase one how why does it why
does this skill set matter to Cloud
um how you can break this down any
resources that I found useful and
projects that I find useful and things
that you should be familiar with the end
of the space certain commands that you
should be familiar with networking
Concepts
um bash scripting Concepts and then any
certifications you might want to look
into and it's the same kind of outline
why it's relevant resources projects
breakdown Concepts you should be
familiar with certifications for every
single phase so programming so
programming Cloud platform double
settlements Cloud security shout out day
uh day is the person who wrote phase
five
and talks about like an introduction to
Cloud security here as well
so be sure to check that outall right let's do this last ones I'm
gettingtiredoh my goodness I
hey takealusian Joy shout out Tech with
Lucy killing it
um big fans we're big fans of tackle
Lucy herelooks a lot like I looks a lot or it
looks a lot organized in my nose I
crammed on my 104 notes into single note
notepad plus plus come on
well how great is no pad plus plus for
formatting I feel like I don't need
super fancy formatting for my notes I
know some people make them like super
aesthetic which is awesome I can't do
that but I need to have at least titles
and stuff like that
what degree track were you in at WGU
shout out WGU
every time when I think like I should go
back and finish school the only school
that I would do is WGU like their cloud
computing track but I'm also at a point
where like it just won't make a
difference in my career it's only going
to be something that I do for the
experience of going back to school and
something that's going to cost me money
um I there's I don't think there's any
way that it would make a bachelor's
would make an impact in my career now
I'll ask
I don't think WGU even has my I.T
security track anymore did it for CCNA
SEC because I didn't they did some
rearranging to their to their curriculum
as well to their tracks right so I know
like the cloud one now has an Azure and
an AWS oneclock being switching from Venus sus
Name by the wayso it's slash self study plus projects
plus networks yeah there you go perfect
also another thing that I feel like a
lot of people are getting messed up on
is and I blame Tech influencers
including myself is that I feel like a
lot of people are too quick to want to
go and build a brand but remember the
Best Brands like self brands are the
ones that are made without the intention
to make a brand so for example when I
started YouTube I literally started
making videos about stuff that I was
doing at work like if you look at my
earlier videos they're all really Niche
Azure functions type of things and
because people could pick up like oh
this is just someone who's actually just
sharing stuff that she's doing like I
felt like that helped now it's turned
more into like career advice and it's
like random Cloud stuff that I know
and now I'm more so on a schedule of
like yeah I'd like to upload a video
every like once a week
um but if you go into making like your
personal brand with like oh I need to
make a personal brand it never works out
well make it like a byproduct right your
goal is not to build not to be a
personal brand expert your goal is to
get into the field or the job you want
to get to and the personal brand is just
something on the side that works
um I I think I covered some of that inyeah it plus can kick rocks uh and and
like a video that I uploaded recently
how to build an online presence I did a
video on that recently too
certain devs also require undergrad or
even Masters is this for teachingrequires claims too if you go to
government oh oh uh government stuff
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
uh Kathy told me about this like she got
security clearance and then all that
kind of stuff and now like going from
you start off as a contractor always and
then
um you're always kind of like hoping to
get that full-time kind of thing but
like you're always on like on the edge
because you might get cut contractors
get caught all the time
so yeah very interesting interesting uh
dynamic or environment to work in the
governmentbig brain move is to go to college just
to drop out to increase
I'm just gonna go to college to drop out
again right
like And subscribe for the YouTube
algorithm thank you Lucy
remember those five to seven people on
shame yeah man but I also remember those
days and I'm like I didn't care about
anything now I'm like so metric driven
which I don't really enjoy
which is why I've been making like a
bunch of random Youtube videos that I
know are not going to do well but
they're just topics that I want to cover
um but there was time like last year
where I was just so focused on like oh
every single video has to be a hit has
to be a success
um but the fun is streams earlier those
in from like all the streams that I've
done these are cool because now we're at
a place where like people just come and
ask questions I love but for a long time
it wasn't like that
um but those early streams where I was
playing like video games remember I was
playing like I wasn't playing FIFA I was
playing like Tony Hawk and skater XL on
stream those were the best
it was like a venting session for mewhile I was in the army they skipped
paying us for two weeks because folks
were grandstanding less space sector
since it's usually so gov dependent went
back to CV Tech Center
what is grandstanding love space Hector
since it's usually so gov dependentfascinatingI've been sharing your learner Cloud
boot camp to people in Camp's Discord
lately who want to get into space great
appreciate you Mike
really appreciate it
umhold on
thanks mine all right Ben shout out Ben
thank you for liking
lfcs re deaf retake from what I remember
it had that waiver as part of their boot
camp I got so busy I let it expire
I I think if I were to do a
certification it would either be one of
the sort of the Azure ones
like maybe 204 I feel like I get the 204
easily
like part of me wants to get the 204
without studying
but I'm scared because last time I did
that I did take the 900 without studying
and I barely passed and that was with
two years of experience
well I have just so much Azure developer
experience now that I feel like I can
take the 204 without studying and barely
pass which is I don't care to have the
best grade on a certification if I pass
I pass that's all but if it would be the
two it would be the 204 maybe the
solution Architects one
um or one of the Linux Foundation onesuh
let's see Gwen and rishab never
considered cka setting for it now and it
seems really beneficial in terms of road
map for saying for kubernetesafter my conversation with Kathy I
definitely have more of like a sense of
urgency to learn kubernetes because she
was like the one thing that I see and
every single customer engagement is
kubernetes like I can't avoid that damn
kubernetes logo so now I'm understanding
like okay if I want to move into a Cloud
solution architect role I definitely
need to know kubernetes well the ones
that I'm targeting like these roles are
different everywhere the ones that I'm
sorry I definitely know kubernetes which
first means I need to understand better
containers in docker
so maybe this sir would make more sense
in that case
um so maybe after I'm done with like my
bash and my Linux Focus I'll shift into
containers andum container orchestration right
um so maybe like let's say January so
March April May and June could be all
containers and kubernetes stuff would be
cool
definitely
Gwen oh it's no worries I used to fun
fact I used to abbreviate my name Gwen
and then someone was like that's not how
you should abbreviate it should be Gwyn
because your name is gwi and eth and I
was like all right sure
I don't really care about that
do you have a video on your sysadmin
journey currently looking to go versus
Admiral some I have a video of how I
went from help desk to success admin
check it out
uh I don't have anything specific I mean
I guess that's a specific ass I can getdo you have a day in the life as a CL
yeah I do I do have a couple daylight
videos on my channel I have like two or
three
but they're not like day in a life
aesthetic videos like oh here's the
super fancy coffee machine at the
Microsoft Office I don't have I tried to
make them as realistic as possible
um
especially the one from like June I
think I did them in June oh my gosh that
day was so long but I tried to make it
realistic so go check that out if you're
interested
uh
uh you're acting like I formatted them I
can't I can't have notes that I don't
format like okay let me show you my
other notes hold on
let me show you
uh share screen share screen
boom all right these are my like these
are my book notes so I'm currently
reading this book the school of life and
I just can't I need to have like I need
to be able to like do bold stuff and
like add pictures and things like that
so I could never use something that uh
is probably too small
I could never use something that
wouldn't allow me to easily like notion
is great the only thing I don't like
about notion has like no offline
offline support but I need something
that I'd be able to do to be able to do
um
formatting on uh where are my study
notes here's some study notes that I
have like Cloud native learning from
last year where to go hereuh here so oh I was starting to learn
containers oh my goodness did I learn
all did I do all this last year
uh introduction to bash ah yes I
remember this
I did this live introduction to Docker I
remember this
uh so yeah anyway you get the idea of
like my my notes like I need to be able
to format them pretty in like in a
program that does it easily
uh what else I feel like I did like
introduction to AKsI should have turned all of these into
videos and blog posts but I just did notthe thing is I have notes to to
later when I need to continue learninguh
you're at let's see yeahoh hold on where are we where where'd I
go here we go
just pass the Linux Essentials on my way
to the Azure shirt let's go Alex
congratulations the Linux essential is
my absolute favorite certification
favorite certification of all time I
don't have many certifications though so
that my opinion is very biased
grandstanding Congress is fighting and
things shut down budget wise and troops
stop getting paid said nope no more good
job for me ah
I guess that's the flip side of the
stability like maybe you're pretty safe
from like recession type things but when
this type of stuff happens thenother schools are either way overpriced
or a bit of scam what wsu's solid other
than the a plus cert and the degree plan
CompTIA makes their way into everything
umit's pretty uh I don't know that's in
response to somebody's practice exams
help a lot monk mode monk mode baby oh
it's because you probably see the left
side monk mode I have a lot of stuff in
there I have like my career journal here
like I tell y'all like always keep
um
uh sinks that you have with your manager
I have like my Dev journal in here I
have some syncs with peers in here too
uh and some advice that people have
given me in here just write that stuff
down y'all write this stuff down because
when people are going to ask you why do
you server I I 100 percent
guarantee that if I ask one of you why
these are a promotion you're gonna give
me some generic generic answer like oh
because I do great work but no people
when people ask you that you should be
able to give detailed and informed
responses
and you can't keep all that information
in your brain because your brain is
meant to be processing it's meant to be
Ram it's not meant to be storage so
write it down
quick quick half an hour at the end of
each week just type in what you did
throw it in anything you want to throw
it into write it on
um
paper journals like I use paper journals
a lot like I use this one is almost done
um
like right write stuff down like this
this one is yeah this one's pretty much
almost done like
some days it's just like a just like a
line like this or sometimes it's going
to be full paragraphs and Pages like
this like write stuff down do yourself a
favor written step down
um all right enough of my soapbox
thing there toouh shout out to the old Cloud Expressway
video I cried inside when I saw that
Azure logo was different in vs code I
love things different back then okay but
to be fair to help with that
hold on
let's go to my GitHubI wish I could update that
umI mean I don't have an update a way to
update that video or anything like that
but if you go to my resume challenge
my Azure resume azureAzure resume challengeAzure is it this one yeah I think this
is one
you're gonna mine and if you go to back
end you will have the code for d.net APS
so the API button at six hold on let me
remove this
there
you have it all I updated this 4.6 a
couple months ago and
the done it three is also in here too
but down at six is here too I don't have
a way to update the the old video or the
blog post or anything like that but uh I
have it on mine made by GPS forward
slash Azure Dash resume and you'll have
that working there
I don't knowhow many visits do I have on my
Azure resumeI checked the other day oh my goodness
come on I checked it the other day
um
and it costs 12 a year to run my as a
resume I have 10 000 10 000 views in
mine fascinating
um
yeah
so for people who are worried about
spending money to run projects like I
think twelve dollars a year or something
most people can affordit's 1am here always having times my bad
my bad I tried to do this one earlier I
did I started at five
it's about to be two hours I gotta stop
all right y'all thank you so much for
hanging out I'm gonna be back sometime

hanging out it was very therapeutic and
a very hectic day a lot of layoff nose a
lot of like not knowing what the future
of you know your career my career uh
happening so hopping on and having a
community to just hang out with answer
questions just chat really cool
um as always I'll try to be as
transparent as I can so if I do get laid
off there's doubt you can bet your
bottom dollar that I'm gonna have a
click baby video on my channel I just
got laid off for Microsoft if I do get
laid off but I didn't get laid off today
um I laugh because it's my way of
handling handling pain I guess
um
