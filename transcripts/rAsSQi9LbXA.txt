[Music][Music]foreign[Music][Music]foreign[Music][Music]can you all hear mecan y'all hear melet me lower the music hold up
I got a green screen yo this is what
this is why I was like taking forever
because I just got it I literally got it
delivered like
like 20 minutes ago I was like oh I want
to try it on stream
what's going on everybodyso let's take a look at this chat one
second let's make this largeruh
uh what up Nikos ectar
Seeker
I typed this because I may not be able
to watch GPS thanks for the motivational
content
you inspired me into taking a difficult
path and change in life but what is
actually easy these daysthank you for sharing your knowledge
thank you for the kind messages really
appreciate thatI'm here to help as much as I can so
it's nice to know that I'm part of
I'm a small part of your Journeys uh
Kemp is from Cape Town what up what's
going on
Connor what's going on
hey everyone
yeah yeah so I got this this is sick but
the reason I'm I'm hold on let me this
music is gonna bother me
Okay so
if I do something like hold on let's see
like if I have like this code thing like
I'm no longer massively in the way
like it's there right
um hold on I forgot update my WSL the
only issue is I don't have a lot of
space behind me soI'm gonna have to move it when I have to
use the chair because I'm like standing
right nowum
but I'll figure that out
so for example if I wanted to probably
make this biggeruh uh if I wanted to move into like
I don't knowuh let's move until the
API sure why notI can now not be in the way I'm still
kind of in the way because it's like
large
because my my self is large
but then I just move
and you all can still see it so I'm
gonna play around with the format
uh and see what works best and whatnot
but I think this is actually pretty cool
uh and like we can open this
no what is this
uh page no it's not an API
and uh where here we go
yeah so it pretty much looks something
like this and now I can
like zoom in
Circle stuff zoom out all that this and
the things I do to get the best best
content that I can for you all
uh but yes that's what I've been up to
lately
uh Connor says geekin yeah pretty much
you can code today since you have the
screen uh like on on
on stream see I whenever I do codes
streams where I am coding they're not
really that popular people really like
the Q and A's type of stuff
so that's why I'm here to just answer
whatever questions you guys may have
um
yeah whenever I I feel like it's because
I'm not very entertaining when I'm
coding because it requires like deep
focus and I just can't pay attention to
the chat so I feel like it's like not as
entertaining uh so for for a live stream
live stream style type of thing
um
q a kind of like works the best
so yeah how's everyone doing
let me make this
probably a little larger this way I can
take a look at this
but we hard care we but we hardcore fans
love when you codeI should have gotten water before also I
don't have too much time today because
um my girlfriend's cooking lunch right
now and it's probably gonna be done soon
it's only hopped on to do a really quick
stream
um but yeahman
also I'm on Windows today I do a video
where I said I switched to Mac which I
did
but I feel like it's like depending on
the day of what I'm feeling
is what I'll be using I still use the
Mac daily but I still find myself coming
back to the Windows machine for
gaming oh my goodness y'all there's this
new game called what is it called sons
of the forest it's in preview still
um early release it is so so good you
all have to play oh my goodness I just
hit this someone texted meshe just said you can take 30 minutes
more
did you hear mebut yeah we can do
so if we want to do like live stream
coding I'm down but I would want to know
what people want to see instead of me
just working on some random stuff
becausethat way it's like more purposeful
a lot of times the stuff that I do for
work
um may or may not be of interest
but also most of the time I probably
can't show you what I'm doing for work
NDA stuff
um so if we keep it like generic and
general stuff that people want to see we
can do thatI was just so sick why didn't I get a
green screen for poor
uh let's take a look at hereuh do me a favor hit a like
hit a like that way we can get more
people hanging out with us apparently I
have 30 minutes more
I just got a text she said
she said you can take 30 minutes more so
I have 30 minutes more before we eat
lunch
um but yeah what's up people usually
peopleum I have tons of questions by now
but maybe just my me rambling here is
entertainingI'm gonna be in Seattle next month
there's a pretty big event going on next
month if people are aware in Seattle for
Microsoft I'm going to be in Seattle
then that's gonna be fun if anyone's
based in Seattle
let's grab a coffee would be awesomehave you worked as a sock or a knock no
never done any security stuff
so
I'm not the biggestresource for that but day
I'll show you day
my guy dayso if we look for day cyber walks this
is my guy
this is my go-to for any security kind
of stuff
he currently works at datadog this kid
is so impressive
I only call I mean he's not a kid in my
eyes he's a kid because he's 21 but he's
so freaking successful and like like one
of the hardest working people ever but
he oh he just released a new video first
year I dated dog that's awesome
but he has a bunch of stuff on security
things
uh like if we go it's probably more
popular
compti plus my first day as a sock
analyst it's probably very relevant to
the person who asked this question this
one right here uh but yeah check him out
day day cyberoxI watch this channel that's awesome
why do you wear a cap in your videos I
wear a cap all the time not just in my
videos
like I
wake up I don't wear it when I when I'm
like
sleeping or like when I work out
sometimes I do but I primarily just have
cap
and I used to have like overhead
headphones but I switched to these
because I started wearing these glasses
that help reduce like like blue filter
but when I was wearing the overhead
headphones it pressed too much against
and it like hurt so I switched to these
uh but the reason why I like hats the
combination of hat and headphones is it
really stimulates
focus and this could just be a placebo
but it works for me so I'm gonna do it
and it helps me feel like I'm like very
kind of like
in
like this one dimension that I have to
focus on whatever work I have
could be Placebo but it is what it is
what's up chilled one huh currently
following your Zero to Hero vid and
guess what
my workplace has a similar upskilling
program three weeks from Friday nine to
five oh wow with a few tweaks rest API
Etc so thanks that's awesome
that is fantastic very happy to hear
that you're moving into this uh new
phase of learning which is awesome very
happyI watch this channel cool cooldid you need to know traditional
networking devops Cisco and python
scripting before doing cloud devopsnoalso python scripting applies to both so
keep that in mind as welldid you need to know traditional
networking devops Cisco net nope nope I
was just trying to see if there's any
other part of that question that I could
provide my more context to but not
really
I went straight I went sysadmin help
desk this admin Cloud engineer
that's what I didI interviewed for an Azure Cloud
engineer job two days ago I have been
working for the same org about 10 years
and I feel it's time to go but also
feeling nervous about it is this normal
to feel I think any time you're trying
to make a jump to anything
in any part of your life it doesn't even
have to be specific to like your career
like I think about like moving to a new
place asking someone out on a date or
making a big purchase picking a major in
school or things like that
you're always going to have a little bit
of Doubt or you're always going to have
a little bit of feelings where you're
like I have no idea what I'm doing
but I've learned to lean into that
feeling because usually at the other
side of that feeling is a lot of great
results
so go for it
you are like Jeff Fritz with the hat I
know Jeff Fritz I I mean technically
he's my colleague but so would other
thousands of people be
but I uh thanks for the subscription
um I
was actually at one of his talks that he
did here in New York a couple months ago
on Maui
very cool guy his ability to
build things uh while live for hours is
pretty cool
but yeah I I was told um
I was wearing hats way before
YouTube pretty much but before joining
Microsoft and stuff like that so then I
I someone told me like have you checked
out Jeff Fritz's website where he has
like his collection of hats I was like
no yeah he like built it on a stream I
was like oh that's pretty awesome
so it's great that we have a couple of
con hat connoisseurs uh and Microsoftis it easier to grasp python once you
get bash scripting down yes for sure
because in in bash You're Gonna Learn
well if you take my bash course you're
going to learn variables You're Gonna
Learn functions you're going to learn
arrays you're going to learn
conditionals Loops put them all together
so yes
one with that foundation and then you do
a couple of things then you take it a
python you're gonna see that there's a
lot of overlap obviously python is a
language
that you can take a lot further
sobig fan thanks for the six months plan
it helped a lot respect from India shout
out India
thank you for following my six month
plan or
if you're doing it right now I
appreciate itit's a dilemma if you are a senior level
engineer they fire you first because
they can hire three to four fresh quick
learning 25 year old Engineers but then
again you can't progress in career
without going up the ladder
I think it's a balance that everyone has
to find personally earlier in my career
switching roles a year and a half like
about the sweet spot for me was a year
and a half until now here at Microsoft
and my current role is the longest I've
ever been in any role
I'm about a year and seven months in
maybe a little more
and I don't have any plans and I've
moved I was promoted last year so I want
to move that rank up instead of jumping
into other roles for now
um
so yeah it's it's it depends on like
what your what your balance is Right
ultimately to make progress in your
career or anything in life you're going
to have to make some sort of sacrifice
or a bunch of sacrifices and oftentimes
you'll find that you can do that now
maybe you can do it later uh for
whatever reason later might be a better
time now might be a better time so just
keep that in mindonce you learn one language you can
learn them all in my opinion I would
agree that's why people need to learn
like the logic behind utilizing
programming languages uh instead of just
memorizing like syntax
what would you recommend to start on the
path of being a cloud engineer
would you like to make videos about road
maps I have I have learned so I'm the
author of learn to Cloud which is pretty
much the most popular open source guide
to cloud computing learn to cloud.guideuh let's go here I'll show you it here
learn to Cloudlearn to cloud.guideso here you go
oh my goodness that is terrible
highlighting there let's do it again
learn to cloud.guide right this is your
roadmap to zero the cloud to entry level
cloud engineer
and you click on guide
and then you go through all so we have
phases
so phase one starting from zero so if
you have no technology
go here
phase one Linux bash networking
fundamentals phase two's programming
fundamentals phase three is cloud
platform fundamentals phase four devops
fundamentals phase five is cloud
security fundamentals and we have
projects and additional resources listed
here
now you may ask how do I know which one
to start right so kind of read through
them
and get a feel for like okay do you
already know this type of content so
phase zero is pretty straightforward
like you do or you don't
once you go to like the first
phase and every base after this at the
bottom I've added a
things you should be familiar with
and it tells you for the Linux one for
example tells you like a couple of
commands and for networking a couple of
concepts for networking
and if you feel like you can do all this
feel free to go on to the next phase
until whatever phase you feel like
you're missing
you don't have to feel like you're stuck
here or like you absolutely have to go
through zero one two
it's meant to be as flexible as possible
without you missing out on what I
believe is the foundation to cloud
computing
each phase includes
the context as to why this technology
matters for cloud
I include sort of what I recommend how
you break it down like do this topic
first do this one second do this one
third and then resources that I
personally recommend I've either
authored the resources or I've used them
so I can recommend them
I try to stick to only free resources
some of them may be paid but if they're
paid they're like 20 30 so it's not like
crazy expensive I'm not telling you to
go to like
six thousand dollar boot camp or
anything like that
and then I list projects that I would
recommend for you to do it each phase
and then again
the things you should be familiar with
and then certifications you might want
to look into again certifications are
not you don't have to do them
but if you do want to do them I list
some that I believe are pretty pretty
helpful here and that's for every single
one of those so programming fundamentals
it all follows that same structure Cloud
platform fundamentals follows that same
structure devops same thing and Cloud
security phase was actually written by
day who I showed the the channel his
channel earlier and following again the
same thing and this is sort of like
um
security fundamentals in the context of
cloud engineering and not necessarily to
be a cloud security engineer
all right now this is sort of
um
back to the homepage this is sort of
like a general guide you take it at your
pace if you want something accelerated I
got a lot of people asking hey how would
I like time this out what if I really
want to just dedicate the next I don't
know year or the next couple of months
to really learn this type of stuff well
then for that I created so back to learn
a cloud.guide on the study plan if you
click on the study plan it's going to
take you to something that I call Cloud
camp
and
what it is is I wrote this the idea for
this came to me back in December and I
was like oh I'd be because I was very
tired of boot camps I really don't like
boot camps that's just my opinion so I
was like What if I created my own boot
camp and I called it Cloud camp and it
was just like a self-study kind of thing
because I've learned everything through
self-study you know sitting down going
on YouTube going through books things
like that so here you have your protocol
kind of just things to keep in mind kind
of the mindset you need to be in to take
advantage of this outline some
instructions here and it's a six month
type of thing so it tells you start with
bash gives you really quick overview
and it gives you like my most
recommended resource to learn that and
says two weeks and it tells you to break
it down 10 days doing this four days
doing that and some project ideas then
you move into networking two weeks again
the breakdown project ideas then python
five weeks breakdown project ideas
Cloud platform breaks down et cetera et
cetera et cetera and what was the last
thing I was gonna say oh and this is six
months and what I do want you to keep in
mind is that I've factored in for this
whole thing
I factored in three days for each face
for documentation purposes so I think
this is pretty important at the end of
each sort of phase that you complete you
kind of go and you write up a blog post
you create a video kind of just summing
up what you've learned maybe it's a
project maybe it's like things that were
challenging anything you really want to
share I think that's pretty important
but that's not where you should be
spending the majority of your time
that's why it's only three days for that
but yeah
so those are the resources I use uh and
that I've created and I recommendwhat did I miss
okay that's what that's at
if I'm Gonna Learn Cloud for the first
time which platform would you recommend
me gcp AWS or Azure I personally think
you can't go wrong with either my
recommendation is usually to just take a
look at the jobs that you're interested
in and see what they ask for the most
AWS Azure gcp you really can't go wrong
so
it's up to the job market and if at the
end of the day you can't pick pick Azure
and then you can come learn Azure on on
my channelI agree your six month plan is dope
shout out from Cape Town shut up Cape
Town thank youoh let's see I don't know what I missed
hererepeat the question because I don't know
where it is
are you organizing no
no boot camp it's just the the outline
that I've provided which I'm already
calling uh I guess technically my boot
camp
but it's nothing that you have to join
or anything just kind of follow it and
you'll get to where you need to gois it always necessary to blog your
journey or build in public
I don't think it's necessary but like
I've mentioned before I think Landing a
job
is 50 your like technical ability your
resume your cover letter the projects
that you've done and 50 who you know
luck opportunity
so you really are only in control of
like half of you know you're 50 and that
50 that I allocate to luck to
opportunity to right place right time I
feel like you can improve by networking
in 2023 the best way to network is to go
on LinkedIn to go on social media to
Showcase your knowledge to put yourself
out there in an authentic and not like
annoying obnoxious way and I think the
best way to do this is by sharing your
technical expertise or just something
that you've learned whether that be via
video a Blog however you want to do it
heck even Tick Tock Instagram things
like that I that's why I recommend doing
itis being a cloud architect the ultimate
goal that one could achieve in this path
what path do you mean you're talking
about learn a cloud
cyber tooth asks GPS what are your end
goals curious about your thought process
as someone with significant experience
that is a fantastic question and
something that I've been trying to
figure out for myself lately
if I'm being 100 honest I don't really
know the only thing that I know that I
want to do for the rest of my life or
however long I can is teach
and ideally it would be teaching
something Technical and ideally it would
be cloud computing
I find it very fulfilling and I also
find that there's a very big need for
different types of teachers with
different types of backgrounds
especially educational backgrounds
because I feel like different students
are impacted by different types of
teachers and it's not necessarily oh a
student can't learn it's more so maybe
there's a different style that works for
them so that's the one thing I want to
do but I've also realized that I can
teach no matter what I can teach on the
side I can teach on YouTube it doesn't
necessarily have to be like my full-time
thing luckily now in Cloud advocacy I
get to teach a lot which is pretty cool
but I
foresee myself going back into like 100
engineering Focus type role but maybe
going into Cloud architect Cloud
engineer at some point but we'll see
I don't have any end goals I just kind
of keep doing it for as long as I I it
feels appropriate
and yeah that's pretty much itwhat Azure project would you recommend
for people who have no hands-on
experience let's take a look
so if you head over to learn a cloud
once again
and then go to the guide on the left
side you're going to hit projects
and then here you have a bunch of
projects AWS Azure gcp and devops
projects if you're looking for Azure
there's Azure Cloud resume challenge
there's the serverless resume API
there's a bunch of architectures that
you can implement the Azure architecture
Center
there's some Azure networking Labs
there's the Azure pet store this one I
highly recommend do the Azure resume
Challenge and then do this one in my
opinion but there's a bunch of other
options here too
so do check that out learn to
cloud.guidewould you confirm that Hands-On versus
certs 100 but I think certs definitely
have a place
and again my framework is always going
to be
associate level cert project and then if
you want to do another certification do
it after that initial project
and then do another project that builds
off the knowledge that you've got from
that additional certification
in my opinion it probably makes more
sense to do it like an associate level
let's say for example do an az104 an
az204 build a project off of that and
then find something like maybe a devops
related certification or a Linux related
certification so you're building out a
wider range and not necessarily a very
specific very niche
a specialty because you've got to
remember you're trying to aim for like
these entry-level roles and when you're
entry level you're just getting started
they Prime they care more about you
being able to pick up new things and be
able being able to work on a more wider
range of things than being a 100 expert
in one areaoh I'm losing track of all these
questions
let's seewould you be interested in being a cloud
keynote speaker for a few minutes at a
school remotely from your home I am
doing a solar project with a school here
in Cape Town combining solar plus Cloud
I'd be interested in hearing more yes
reach out to me on LinkedIn uh depending
on the date we'd have to take a look at
that but that sounds cool we'd love to
Tyrone asks how do you deal with
learning multiple Technologies and the
feeling of being overwhelmed
so I have a video actually with the
framework and kind of the mindset that I
use for this for me it's pretty much
I plan ahead I'm a very big planner I
love using calendars and to-do lists and
I use now I use Microsoft Loop I'm
moving over from notion to Loop to have
my notes and things like that but it's
all about giving yourself a time frame
and sticking to it so for example the
beginning of this year January February
March was all about Linux was all about
bash for myself now moving more into a
focus on oh how can I leverage AI apis
things like open AI API learning chat
gbt learning GitHub co-pilot and things
like that
for about another couple of months and
then after that I'll move on the goal
for me is to always stick to what I have
planned so I plan to learn Linux and
Bash even more then just stick to it
plenty of things will always come up
but for that I pretty much allow myself
to maintain myself informed so I'll
listen to podcasts I'll watch videos but
I won't pick up like a tutorial that'll
take me hours or it will kind of get me
learning something new or like Sidetrack
me
don't get me wrong there's definitely
going to be situations where you're
gonna have to select pick up a new
language or whatever it is for whatever
reason but I find that usually people
get distracted and off their learning
path because they get an influence from
like social media or Tech Twitter or
LinkedIn or something like that so do
yourself a favor sit down create a study
plan stick to it and then later on
reassess that's what I doafter your two certs two projects you
apply for junior collateral regular
Cloud role or something like assist
admin role
so usually what I recommend and a lot of
people don't like to hear this but what
I recommend is to have a year of some
type of support role of experience
because that plus your projects and your
search are going to make you a
well-rounded candidate
because after all experience
is is
the goat right
and Landing an entry-level support role
is pretty
a lot easier to do than the majority of
other Tech rules do that for a year
couple of that with the Project's
asserts and you'll be in a great
position
I recommend going for anything that's
going to be a next step for you
I feel like people tend to get confused
and think that if it doesn't have cloud
and the role title then I shouldn't go
for it but pay more attention to
descriptions for example from making the
move for me from help this this admin
the job description of the sysadmin gig
set at the bottom plenty of plenty of
opportunities to get Hands-On with
Microsoft azure so I was like let me go
for it but if I was closed off because
it didn't have cloud in the title I
would have missed out on on that
opportunity so pay more attention to
descriptions than titles when you're
getting started titles will make more of
it'll be more of a deciding factor the
more you move up but things like
sysadmin things like Junior Cloud
engineer support engineer or Cloud
support engineer Cloud analyst Cloud
admin a lot of help desk rules now have
uh like tasks with Azure active
directory and things like that and those
are Cloud Technologies right so anything
that gives you some kind of exposure to
cloud in my opinion is a good stepoh my goodnessEvan says Hey GPS I've been in it for
years looking to transition to a cloud
role got the AWS Cloud certified
practitioner cert work in our
architecture then projects any
suggestions to add so you've been in it
for years that's awesome so I would say
if you got okay and you're doing two
more one more certification okay perfect
so finish up that sir
get two projects that you can explain in
and out and then most I mean you just
told me you have experience in it so I'm
going to say that's probably going to be
uh relevant so tailor your resume tailor
your cover letter and become very
comfortable with speaking about your
projects like you should be able to
answer any question people ask you about
your projects why did you select this
service why did you select that service
make sure that I'm GitHub make sure
they're documented nicely
and
practice your your interviewing skills
in terms of like the soft skill
questions that you'll get so they'll ask
you things like when was the last time
you faced uh a colleague who gave you
negative feedback how did you handle
that you don't want to have to come up
with those answers in the interview
itself you should be able to practice
these and these are very generic not
specific to just Tech or Cloud so you
can go and Google them or Bing them or
ask chat GPT and go practice them become
comfortable about talking about your
skill set but I feel like you're in a
good position because you already have
experience in it so learn how to
leverage that learn how to speak to that
the best way possible
and I think you're probably in a good
position
what up zidi
thank you this is my favorite Cat by the
way
it's uh tux
peace out campus have a good oneCody asks I've been a junior susadment
for about a year now awesome
is a normal path to go for a cloud-based
role next if you want to get into Cloud
yes
I I think that's a very natural
progression there you could also make a
jump into maybe like networking engineer
or maybe something more
like Security based if you wanted to
but I think the cloud is filled with
opportunities and will expose you to a
lot of other types of Technologies and
areas so something like Cloud support
Cloud engineer and then from there you
can move into another Niche like Cloud
security which is very lucrative or
[Music]
Cloud architect things like that
all right I gotta go y'all because I
need toum
eat
but I'll see you all I don't know I'll
stream next week or something like that
peace out everyone
