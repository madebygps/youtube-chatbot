what's going on everybody happy 2021 i
wish you a year filled with
opportunities
um and you know all the goals that you
want to accomplish
i hope you do so so i figured i'd start
a series where i talk about
books that have in some way impacted my
career they're not all going to be i t
slash tech cloud related a lot of them
are but not all of them
like i have some ideas for some personal
finance books that have really helped me
psychology public speaking etc but we
are going to start off with my absolute
all-time favorite tech book which is
the phoenix project without giving away
any spoilers
it's a story so it's fiction about
a company that has an i.t project that's
been
delayed several times and it's over
budget and
the person who's in charge of that
project quits or gets fired i can't
exactly remember
and then a new manager comes in takes
over the project and the cto tells this
person hey
if you don't get this thing back on
track i'm going to outsource it and
we're going to fire everyone who works
in i.t
so that's hundreds of people and the
story just goes on
and tells how he manages that and i was
working in helpdex
when i read this book and it just hit
home and
the one thing that this book helped me
realize was
that it kinda is a mess everywhere
so that's also why i say like no matter
what level you're at in your career
you'll find some kind of use if if only
just like an entertaining story
um i think this is a fantastic read
there's also another part to this book
which is called the devops handbook
which is
a nonfiction it explains the technical
aspect
of the concepts that are being explained
to be a story in the phoenix project
um and as you read the devops handbook
you're going to
there's certain pages and certain
concepts and chapters that you'll read
and
it'll remind you of concepts that were
explained in the story
and it becomes like a full circle it's a
little harder to get through obviously
because
it's you know technical stuff it's not a
story but i think those two are a great
combo
to to simply read i mean you don't
necessarily have to learn anything
um but it's entertaining and if you do
pick up the devops handbook it is it is
there's some things in there that that
um will help you
especially if you want to see like a
or if you want to be in more of a
manager position there's a lot there
that that would be quite handy for you
um but yeah that's uh my my favorite alt
all-time technical book anywayi wanted to introduce two new segments
to
my videos one is going to be new content
of the week
and that's just covering content that
i've released on the a cloud guru
platform
this week we have two new azure videos
i'm going to link them in
the description one is azure this week
which
is a series that covers just the new
news and updates on azure every week and
i was fortunate to be on the first
episode with my colleague laura clint
um again link in bio link in bio link in
the comments sorry
um and the other one oh is the another
segment that i'd like to introduce is
question of the week so i'll just grab a
question from one of my youtube
comments and answer it this
week's question of the week is how much
money did i make
in my first cloud roll 75 000
plus full benefits
keep in mind that i'm based in
connecticut usa
um because you know 75 000 can be
a like a lot or a little depending on
location all that kind of stuff
so yeah there you have it that's the
answer to that question anyway
uh if you have any books you'd like to
recommend or or books like you'd like to
see
