welcome
thank you thank you for being here I
had mentioned to you well I guess the
idea of you in my solution architect
confuses me video and then
uh really glad that you reached out and
you're like hey I think you're talking
about me and I was like yeah I'm totally
talking about you but I don't want to
mention youtrying to respect privacy but I
appreciate you you hopping on and
chatting with me about
your role and all that kind of stuff but
we can start from the beginning and
people have plenty of questions which
we'll try to address as many as possible
uh but how about you start us off with
just an introduction what do you do what
makes your name
what do you do stuff like that like
what's your elevator pitch for yourself
sure
um my name is Kathy Lee I am a woman
and an engineer
um I live in Portland Oregon I have been
uh with Microsoft for almost five years
I hit five years in September
um and yeah I uh I was hired uh at
Microsoft uh in 2018
uh as a software engineer for an org
called commercial software engineering
and uh I was in that org for uh I don't
know two three years or something like
that before I moved into uh the customer
success unit the CSU where I am now as a
Cloud solution architect
um before I was at Microsoft I spent uh
almost a decade at the department of
energy
um working for the federal government is
not fun
um and uh yeah I mean and before that I
sort of ping-ponged around to different
jobs I entered the job market
um in 2000 so it's really easy for me to
you know count back how many years I've
been working as a professional 22 23 oh
my gosh 23. your first job
as I guess professional adult was a
techra
yes what role was it do you remember
yeah yeah I was a software engineer
um for a startup that started off named
gulfgateway.com and then they changed
their name to greens.com
um and they were like doing like online
tea times
so you could you could you could book
your tea times online so like you know
our our software would be implemented at
different golf courses and then these
golf courses would be able to let people
schedule their Tea Times online okay so
you've been pretty much your entire
career software engineer or software
engineer related
so we got years of experience did you
23. you remember I mean we've so for
context people we've had a couple of
conversations before I know we first
spoke maybe I was a couple months at
Microsoft
uh we had like a like afraid I feel like
we did but we had like a conversation or
something yeah I remember yep we did
yeah I remember that and then we had one
more recently over the fall I believe
and then now again but I'm very much
always in the know
of what you're up to because of social
media and I think it's vice versa right
um yeah yeah definitely that's kind of
the context of our
uh relationship work friendship whatever
it is
um yeah so I I we have spoken before and
that's why I think you were like the
exact person to have on for this type of
interview because I think you
very easy to talk to but also
um whenever I've asked you stuff about
your role about tech in general it's
never been like an intimidating
conversation it's always felt like very
friendly uh so I really appreciate that
and I think people who are watching it
appreciate that too
um what if we we start first
talking about like educational
background and how did you land your
first software engineering gig
sure
um I have a pretty sort of
I don't know
checkered past maybe is a way to put it
um
so
uh my parents uh are immigrants they
immigrated here from Taiwan
um and that particular wave of
immigration uh was sort of like that
Highly Educated
um like wave and um so my dad was a
professor at Michigan State University
my mom had her Masters in botany
um and they were like 100 the tiger
parents everyone has heard of my parents
were totally like terrifying tiger
parents
um in the sense of like you know I could
not bring home anything less than an a
without like feeling scared for my lifeum and so I you know towed the line for
a really long time and I did my best and
I you know oh Kitty and I got you know
Straight A's
um until my junior year of high school
um I think this is probably not uncommon
in
um you know people who are raised in
this kind of environment I just had a
mental breakdown when I was 16. like I
at 16 I was like
Prime to be like valedictorian of my
high school and like you know I was
involved in uh music and like
not sports
but like I I had like a lot of things
going on when I was 18. yeah yeah and
then um and then I had a meltdown and I
didn't I wasn't interested in school
anymore and to be honest I almost didn't
graduate from high school
like that's how epically I melted down
like I went from almost valedictorian
I was like I didn't oh like yeah
graduated from high schools because my
twin sister intervened for me and begged
um the government teacher to just give
me a D minus and let me graduate
um because we had to have that like half
semester government class we had to pass
it to graduate from high school and I
was 100 failing that class I don't think
I even went to it once
like I think I spent that entire class
like in the parking lot of the high
school sleeping in my car
yeah
okay okay interesting and then um so my
dad was a professor at Michigan State
and
um he was pretty like opinionated that
we should all go there he was like it
doesn't matter where you go for
undergrad what really matters is where
you go for for grad school and you you
see how he did that
school yeah you have to go to there's
like the expectation of course you will
go to grad school right he's like it
doesn't matter where you go to undergrad
so I went to undergrad at Michigan State
Kicking and Screaming by the way I told
my parents I did not want to go to
college and they were like you're nuts
if you think you're not going to college
so I matriculate I get into college and
um surprise surprise I flunk out like
repeatedly okay like I think I think I
flunked out three times
wow
did you I don't really know a college
Workshop but do you pick a major going
in
okay did you did you pick something or
yeah I picked English literature okay
um because I really liked reading and
writing
um and so but I didn't go down my
classes so it's not like it really
mattered what my major was okay okay
right
um and hilariously so I used to like at
Michigan State they're on the semester
system so the semesters are very long
like four months long right so that's a
long time to like lose your
concentration and just stop going to
class which like I did like every
semester I went to Michigan State but
the Summers had really short semesters I
think those were like eight weeks long
okay and so I would always take summer
school when I was in college and I'd
always get my GPA up by taking math
classes okay it's a little happy because
I knew I knew I could get an A in math
even though I was an English literature
major like that was my that was my like
hack to try and like
not have them kick me out balance it out
I don't like it yeah yeah so
um anyway I I did that for like you know
four years or whatever like you know
almost flunking out flanking out
bringing my GPA up by taking math
um and then finally uh when I was 21
um
my uh counselor at the time like you
know the person who's like helping you
figure out when you can graduate was
like okay here's the deal
you've done so badly
that you you kind of have to start over
like if you if you wanna if you want to
stay at Michigan State you just kind of
have to start over you can't like
there's there's nothing we can bring
with us here really um yeah and I was
like
well
if that's the case then I may as well
just start over someplace else okay what
I mean like why the heck am I in
Michigan have you been there it sucks
sorry sorry for anyone who's from
Michigan but like or still lives in
Michigan but like it's cold it's humid
in the summertime the mosquitoes are
trying to kill you like it's just not a
nice place so that's when I moved to
Portland okay wait you were so living in
Michigan right oh yeah so okay okay now
that makes a lot of sense all right yeah
my dad was a professor at Michigan State
I went to Michigan State therefore I was
living like five miles from my parents
house so you're like the majority of
your life you were living in Michiganum and up until I was 20 I was 22 when I
moved to Portland but up until 22 like I
had lived my whole life in like pretty
much 10 square miles
okay yeah okay
okay I see I see the decision now yeah
yeah so I was like get me out of here
um I I need a like a totally fresh start
so I moved to Portland uh so I I decided
at 21 that I was gonna move but I didn't
move until I was 22. this is 1997.
um and uh I uh start going to Portland
State University which is sort of like a
like an urban University that will
accept pretty much anybody it's it's
like a community college but a four-year
school okay what I mean okay
um like there are harder car loan
applications that you have to fill out
than like the application to go to
Portland State like it's that kind of
University
um and so I at that point I was like
well I don't really know what I want to
do okay right
um I had kind of come to the conclusion
that I couldn't really stick with
English literature as much as I love to
you know read and to write because
you know my parents raised me upper
middle class and it just didn't do me
any favors
like I was not good at being poorI also don't want to like depend on
someone else for like my lifestyle right
I like I should fund my own lifestyle no
I know so okay yeah so I was like okay
what what what skills do I have what do
I have here like I sort of like did you
know what am I working with exactly and
so I kind of did an audit of like my
skills and I was like you know what you
know my dad actually forced me to learn
about computers when I was growing up
um and he made us like like program
little programs like on five and a
quarter inch floppy disks like whoa what
does that look like what what what
language or
I think it was basic okay I honestly
don't know Gwen I was like eight
like I don't know it was just like I was
just like a little like terminal and I
would just like you know be like go
um but I was like you know I I felt like
a pretty strong
um
I guess affinity for that like I'm like
it's not a struggle for me to grok
computer stuff okay right and at that
age it was just like literally computer
stuff to do right and do you remember
enjoying it
yeah okay it was it was like it was fun
it was easy I almost didn't consider it
like for work because it didn't seem
like work okay do you know what I mean
yeah it's just like fun okay so I was
like okay yeah I have I I have this let
me let me do this and uh Portland State
had a um an information systems and
qualitative analysis program which is
basically like computer science for
business people or something like this
um and so I
did that program
um there were CS classes that were
required I think you had to take like
three CS classes
um and they were just like so fun like
for me like an absolute like breeze okay
see what I mean like just like
like this is this is coming easy this is
coming naturally it's way easier than
English yeah
it's way easier than trying to like
write like a 20-page paper I can imagine
right
nobody likes that so
um yeah I uh I I was I guess it was like
1999 and
um I remember going to like you know
another sort of graduation audit and
um my counselor telling me hey you need
to take this Logistics class okay or you
can't graduate
and I was like are you freaking kidding
me right now I totally took that class
at Michigan State I didn't do great at
it but I certainly did not fail it okay
um and I got a million parking tickets
for that class too
so like I definitely you got that class
yeah yeah yeah you got to get the the
value out of it come on yeah totally and
they were like well you have to take it
it's not we're not accepting it as an
equivalent so you have to take it and I
just sort of took a stand and I was like
I'm not wow
college so
you did College pretty much twice and
you still didn't graduate you didn't
want to graduate exactly and you know my
uh that counselor was kind of laughing
at me because she was like
um your uh transcript reads like someone
who couldn't figure anything out for
themselves because like I had taken so
many classes over like gosh was it like
six or seven years at this point
um I failed a lot of them I didn't fail
all of them okay um and they were from
all over the place right I would just be
like oh that class looks interesting
I'll take it oh that class looks
interesting I'll take it I wasn't like
focused you didn't have like an end goal
or or like oh I definitely want to go do
this after I graduate kind of thing yeah
yeah I just was like oh I don't know
um and so she was like you have enough
credits like to like graduate for sure
you just don't have enough concentration
of credits in any one place okay to
graduate
okay so because I'm guessing it's like
because you need to graduate in some
specific program or something like that
yeah yeah
you're just okay that's I don't think
I've ever heard of that situation but I
do feel I feel like that there's a lot
of pressure to kind of figure out what
you want to do for school at such an
early age they think about being yeah
like I remember being 18 and I wanted to
be uh
a journalist so I wanted to get into
the journal as journalism is a major I
think it is a communication something
like that yeah something like that and I
was like this is just like the best
decision for my life and then I sat down
with my mom and she's like you're not
gonna make any money so then there goes
that and then you know when you're a kid
it's like what else are you gonna decide
because that's what you are at that age
you're pretty much a kid it's a lot of
pressure uh coming to high school and
trying to figure out everything you want
to do I don't see why more people don't
come out with just like a bunch of
random classes like more often
well
that was my experience I wanted to be a
high school English teacher that's why I
started off as an English literature
major so the the idea was I get my
undergrad and English lit and then I do
a master's in education and then I'd be
able to teach but again my parents
raised me to upper middle class and I
just really did not want to be poor you
were um yeah you were used to you I
guess a lifestyle
and you have to at least maintain it
yeah yeah exactly makes sense yeah so
you don't graduate from college and and
I don't how does but how do you get a
song you have to think about the timing
yes I know think about the timing I know
that's important
so this is 19.99 slash 2000 right yeah
and what's happening during this time
right it's the.com boom everyone has a
right tech company
yeah and people are like you hear
stories like during that time like I got
a I got a Porsche as a siding bonus
right I didn't know that oh yeah that
was that was stuff that happened back
then a Porsche back in 1999 as a signing
yeah yeah yeah yeah people were people
were getting like crazy deals
um and at that point if you could Spell
visual bases they were like when can you
start right and I I had I had like you
know lots of these classes right so
um I applied for this job at the startup
golfgateway.com greens.com whatever it
was
um and they hired me well and they were
like you know we would like you to get
your degree so please work on that and I
was like okay but then I didn't what was
what was that interview process like
oh God I don't even remember yeah like
this was
almost 25 years ago now but like
it must have been nerve-wracking yeah I
had no idea
you got it yeah I would love to know
like how did you answer the questions or
what the questions look like or or like
all of that like do you remember like
you know struggle or anything like that
like this this is for sure what I know
about that job it was all in C plus plus
okay did you have any any experience
with C plus at all before like maybe any
college oh yeah I mean well well see see
okay not C plus plus okay um because
like all of our computer science classes
in college were in C
um so
like I at least was familiar with like
the basic constructs of the language
um yeah absolutely yeah that that job
was all in C plus plus I mean this will
date me severely but like
I was at least two years into my career
before c sharp came out okay interesting
so that's so funny how old it's a fun
fact
do you feel like so you learned all your
programming knowledge in college or did
you learn oh hell no outside of you
don't know you don't learn anything in
college let's be honest
no no no no no no college does not
prepare anyone for professional work to
be fair I learned C plus plus the two
semesters that I wasn't in college okay
not C plus plus the basics to program I
would say
I think I had a really cool teacher
though and he was the only one who kind
of saw any potential in me and
and he would just give like the hardest
homework like once you were out of class
just for his class you would literally
spend every single because I had the
class Maybe
like four times a week
um you would spend like six hours doing
his homework because it was like you
have to go code the exercise and even if
it was as simple as like oh code a
program that will calculate I don't know
some formula like you had to rock that
right documentation so they would write
a word doc like table of contents um
glossary and like oh screenshots uh FAQ
all that kind of stuff even if the
program was like five lines so he really
like
kicked their butts with that class but I
felt like I learned a lot because of
that but then again that sounds the bass
sounds useful yeah yeah the basics
absolutely and obviously I picked up
more later on working but I guess I have
to be fair give give credit where Chris
do but I didn't go to college here I
went to college in Ecuador well you know
the two semesters so maybe there's I've
from what I've known that educational
system is a little bit more difficult
even though it's like such a small and
unknown country
um
but yeah gotta get credit where credits
do
we'll we'll get into this a little bit
later when we talk about my job but my
experience was all Engineers from Latin
America is they are
a plus okay so there must be something
going on that's crazy there must be
something going on in those Educational
Systems okay but yeah we'll touch on
that later yeah so so what's this first
gig like like how long did you last like
what what was your day-to-day life I
lasted as long as the company lasted
which was six months
they went belly up in six months so and
you know the the funny thing is like
I've seen your videos where you talk
about the progression of your salary
um and that job
um offered me 35 000 a year which I felt
like was a million dollars you're good
yeah yeah yeah yeah I was like holy holy
crap I have so much money
um so with that six months of experience
um I moved on to another startup okay
right okay and that other startup
offered me sixty thousand dollars I was
like
if at 35 you're rich oh you could like
retire I like this that like I almost
doubled my salary in like six months
right I was just like what's going on
this is amazing how much time was there
between like the other company like I
guess you leaving or you know ending the
job at the first company to the second
one well this was still the.com boom
even though greens.com went Belly Up
Like This was still like you know the
bot the the Boom is happening and so I
was snatched up pretty quickly
um there was hardly any time off between
jobs I and I want to say maybe there
wasn't any time off between jobs okay
um and I I worked there for a year I
think at this next startup
at this next startup okay
um and then this startup went Belly Up
as well
um and it was a um it was sort of like a
financial services application
um and so after that
um I got a job at um a company called
carillion
um which did like online banking
software so because I already had had
the experience with like the financial
system software they hired me
um as again software engineer
um and uh that was I think in like 2001
um so and I worked there for two years
um and that was where uh well I
shouldn't say that the job before that
was where I met Scott Hanselman that's
another fun fact I guess our
uh how we first got to talk to each
other was through having that Mutual
connection with Scott uh you have a warm
introduction the warm handoff the warm I
don't know what it's called the worm
introduction yeah yeah that um you
obviously have many many more years of
Friendship with Scott and uh it was
something that was I guess interesting
uh how
and I guess we have that in common
um what what was the what was like
like the perks and stuff like that at
these kinds of jobs back then because
you know now that's like a big thing
about working in techs like sign on
bonuses free lunches stuff like that no
perks nothing just like kind of like
stand up jokes
no perks
um
at greens uh uh yeah no perks we were in
like Suburban hell uh like strip mall
kind of area
um and and then the financial services
startup
um
definitely no perks
the biggest perk was that the office
building was next to a really good
Cambodian restaurantso
what what's what's the scene like is it
very much you know now like the
stereotypical ping pong tables arcade
games in the offices none like
it was just cute
land all right okay that's just cute
land there's there's no there's there's
no common area there's no nothing it's
just Cube Land
um and at carillion
um
it was like they had an uh an actual
kind of like campus where they had I
think like three buildings
um and so they had like more like a
better sort of like
I don't know common area space but
there's still no ping pong table there's
no free beverages there's no like free
lunch there's none of that like actually
the biggest perk of that company was um
when I got a puppy they let me bring my
puppy to workall right cool what what's the uh what
was the work-life balance like was that
a thing back then was that like you know
how that's like a buzzword now I guess
um
do you feel like people were working
extra
uh was it like sort of accepted like
that type of thing or I don't know I
feel like at that point
um you know the whole uh I.T people
working too hard thing hadn't really
crested
um
I can only speak from my experience like
I have a 20-something person yeah what
do you know about making money for the
first time
I was not about work
like I did my work I got it done okay I
feel like I was pretty good employee but
like like when it was time to go home it
was time to go buy a puppy at home I had
friends you know we had to go to the
clubit's funny to think about now but that's
that's
what I did back then more important
things to dothen was was that second gig C plus plus
as well
yes okay all right so now you've got
some pretty
pretty good like what like a over a year
two about two years of these plus plus
experience that's that's got to be good
for the resume
that doesn't matter anymore but sure I
haven't touched C plus plus since then
okay interesting all right so let's so
after this this gig
what what comes after that
so I was at carillion for uh like a
couple years so this is now my third job
out of school okay
um and then that's when the bust
happened
right the.com bust okay
so that was that long I thought it was
quicker to be honest
oh yeah no I mean it kind of like slowly
busted but when it busted it like really
bust okay
um so there was a period of time 2002
2003 where like I remember I was a party
um
and you know the party is like a whole
bunch of like 20-something I.T
professionals like myself you know and
um like no one at this party had a job
unemployedokay that's how bad it was that's how
bad it was I feel like
might be
get to that I was about to ask you like
that kind of sounds like it feels it
starts to feel familiar
yeah because I was starting to we were
talking about this before but I was like
I'm starting to freak out what where
we're at but then again I haven't been
through anything
similar at all
um but then I wanted to ask you like
what what does it feel like now compared
to what you've been through before
well it feels familiar because all the
signals are all the same oh my God right
you get the same like economic signals
you get the same like
um like Rumor Mill going crazy kind of
stuff like when the when the rumor world
starts going crazy you know it's like
for a reason like like when I was early
in my career I might have like been like
oh that's just a rumor like there's
there's nothing concrete so why
speculate
um but now that I've been through this a
couple of times like
I I don't I still don't take it as
anything concrete yeah but you know that
when those rumors are happening it's
like a sign that something's really yeah
going on okay um they don't they don't
start for no reason
um is I guess what I mean but um
yeah no uh it it all fell apart in 2002
2003. I think I was unemployed for like
six months
were you after curling trying to get
gigs like you were just oh I was okay
okay oh I was what about likewise was
there like um indeed or stuff like that
then there was dice no
dice.com was around there was no indeed
um
there were you know recruiters
um about was been around
um
so you could work with different
recruiting companies
um
you know you could you could troll dice
um and because pretty much everyone I
knew was unemployed as well like we were
all just trying to like help each other
out yeah you know like hey I found this
posting it looks like something you
could do or you know someone would send
me something similar
um I actually have some like friends
from that time that like like stick with
me to this very day because we all sort
of went through that together and it was
very like it was very hard yeah
um yeah six months unemployed like I had
no no one like to depend on you know I
was single
um
my parents were like you're an adult
so rightly so we are not going to give
you money
um
and yeah so I was just like on my own
and it just felt really scary
um but I did find something eventually
um there was a few like weird things in
there I'm not even gonna talk about that
because it was so weird but um I did
eventually and end up at this place that
was pretty hilarious called Blackwell
book Services okay
um we called it the Blackwellum it was a very depressing place like
very depressing
um like even like the work environment
was like old do you know what I mean
like old acoustic ceilings everything
just kind of looked a little dirty like
it was just like just just a sad
depressing place
but at the time I was just like I just
need to work I just need to make money
so I was like thrilled with that job I
had it for I think like two or three
years C plus plus as well
no that one was Visual Basic so this is
your introduction into Microsoft land
well curling was also Microsoft it was
also visual based okay okay and we did
start
um because Scott worked at carillion
um at the time he wasn't working for
Microsoft but he was the regional
director
um for uh like the Portland area I think
maybe the Pacific Northwest anyway
um so he he was like pushing you know
Microsoft stuff and um we all sort of
like learned C sharp together on that
job so you have
a lot of c-sharp experiences then now
too yes okay cool yes cool
um before we move on I wanted to ask I
guess for myself like you know that time
of going through like not having a job
like if you look back at it can you
think of any advice you'd give someone
who might go through that
I don't know maybe someone listening
this is going through a layoff or
something
yeah uh the the number one thing I will
say is you have no idea how long this
will last okay so don't blow all of your
Severance money on drinking too much
because you need to blow off steam which
is what I did
which is what I did I love I love the
realness of this I mean I was in my 20s
yeah everyone I know was laid off like
we were drinking so much what was the
seventh like it was a couple months pay
yeah it wasn't much I think I got like a
month oh okay yeah okay yeah but I blew
it I blew it all like so fast on
drinking so how did you survive like a
cup of noodles and some bread or
something pretty much so you know you
get unemployment yeah right yeah yeah
and unemployment was just about enough
for me to pay my rent
um paying my car payment and buy
groceries but my groceries were like
Ramen yeah ketchup yeah
yeah like beans and rice rough kind of
diet all right yeah I like yeah
I like the the I guess be smart with
your money generally yeah yeah just you
I mean you you have no idea how long the
season will last right like I remember
thinking at the time
um that I don't know however people
watched Seinfeld but I was like I could
have a summer of Georgeyou've ever seen it but uh George
Costanza gets laid off and he's like so
excited he's like I'm gonna have to
Summer of George so I was like yeah I'm
gonna have the summer of George I got
laid off I think in the summer and so I
was like I'm just gonna like
have a good time spend my Severance
money like drink with my friends party
like whatever and then the dark winter
months hit and I realized that I'm broke
I'm hungry I'm hungry I haven't eaten
like a decent meal in Forever
um and I have no idea how long this is
gonna last like my my thought when I was
initially laid off was
um to that point you know all of my job
experience had been like I find a job
really fast yeah right so why would that
be different right I was just like oh
I'll find a job whenever I whenever I'm
ready to find one like it'll just be
like they're waiting for me and I may as
well just enjoy the summer take the
summer off and then when the Summer's
over then I'll start looking for a job
do you and do you recommend people just
if it does happen just immediately get
to trying to find another thing
I mean I think it depends on a lot of
things yeah right
um it depends on how much Severance you
get like some people I know who have
been laid off recently have gotten like
months and months and months of
severance like I would tell those people
take a freaking vacation yeah try and
get the burnout off of you right feel
like refreshed and ready to work yeah
excited to work not like dreading okay
right you want to wait until you have
that feeling of okay now I'm ready I'm
excited I want to work
um
but those are also the people who tend
to have more experience and so those are
the people easier for them generally
yeah yeah have less trouble finding a
job but I would say that if you're a
junior person and you have the horrible
luck of being laid off in this
environment yeah get on it like get like
like press your network immediately
like be relentless yeah I mean Juniors
tend to have the energy to do that
anyway so I guess that kind of works in
their favor
um yeah yeah but Juniors also have a lot
of things working again against them
right like I have I have almost 25 years
of a network to Leverage
do you know what I mean I'm gonna call
you if something happens to me
a lot of people call me when things
happen to them for that reason because I
know a lot of people yeah
um and I've been in the industry a
really long time and
um
so yeah like
but if you're a junior then you know
you're going to tend to have a much
smaller Network yeah I think the reality
is like it is just gonna suck like I
don't want to put like a fake positivity
spin to it it's just just it's better to
be real than kind of get let down or
yeah there's going to be a lot of pain
yeah um already or like it's already
happening
yeah there has been pain and there's
more pain to come yeah and we don't know
when the pain will stop we'll end yeah
but we do know it will end at some point
okay there's a nice positive spin to it
yeah yeah
so this this what did you say this is a
book place Blackwell Blackwell's
Blackwell book services using visual
studio already on a Visual Basic
and you were there for I think you
mentioned a couple years two three years
something like that two three years did
you enjoy the work
no no but you're just doing it
absolutely not we were we were replacing
a mainframe system
and it was like an it was like an Erp
so it's like ordering bookslike this is not exciting work yeah no I
mean like a startup or anything riveting
or like you're changing no no and um
yeah it was like I said it was a very
depressing place to work
um
there are people there who had been
working there for like 30 years though
so it was one of those kinds of places
you know what I mean like one of those
like smaller companies where people just
like stay forever and they like never
leave
um and I was very worried
about being sucked into the Blackwell
okay yeah you're very aware of like you
can't you can't stay there too long or
you will be sucked into the blood
forever become one of those people who
just stay there
yeah okay interesting what um
did you did this place close as well or
did you leave
no I I left because at that point the
economy had recovered
and I had other options right so this is
what I'm saying do you remember around
it's like 2004 or five-ish
yes because then isn't there like
another economy downfall a few years
after like 2008
2008 8 was when I was already working
for the federal government and the
federal government's pretty shielded
from that kind of like recession cycle
okay okay
um
so yeah I left I left the Blackwell to
work for a company called TransCore
which does like Logistics software and
it's also not fun at all like it was
social how can I get my truck from A to
B to pick up another thing like yeah
that's what it was and it was it was uh
c-sharp okay okay C sharp did you like
because you now you have like C plus
plus C sharp Visual Basic was did you
having worked with all them would you
starting to grow like a preference for
one or you didn't care oh my God C sharp
all the way okay okay I'm still I'm
still c-sharp all the way it continually
like frustrates me that I am a c-sharp
developer and at Microsoft the company
that created the language I never get to
use it yeah I was I when you mentioned
that last time we spoke I was somewhat
surprised I know you keep telling me
that you keep waiting for like a.net
engagement to come up and it just
doesn't happen to you
I'm still waiting yeah
but the
so this company that you're at you're
doing C sharp in
like what does that look likeum it's mostly back endthis is before rest uh was releasing
um so yeah we're just we're just writing
like back-end Services
um we also had like a Java team that
also wrote some back-end services that
we had to integrate with Integrations I
think are always fun I always love
Integrations what is what does that look
like then though like because you know
how you know microservices are a big
thing now was what were is it primarily
just like monoliths things like that
yeah yeah yep do you do a lot of
microservices stuff now
yes do you have a preference yeah a lot
of my job is uh breaking up monoliths
okay into into microservices yeah that's
a lot of people's like modernization
plan do you
so you know having worked you know in
these jobs with all monoliths I'm
assuming that experience really helps
you now with what you do now
yeah I mean it's all additive so yeah
yeah like it I love it love it okay so
have you have you used Java did you use
Java back then have you I didn't use
Java back then but I have had to use it
at work here you don't sound too excited
a lotJava Man
it's something
it's something it Compares it gets
Compares a lot to c-sharp I mean it gets
compared I don't know if it's fair but
it does yeah
um
yeah I once like it was like 7 p.m and I
was still working and I was working on a
an engagement that uh was Java Centric
and um I just needed to add one hour to
an hour
how the freaking hard can this be
do you know what I mean like this cannot
be that hard I spent an hour trying to
figure this out before I finally was
just like you know what I don't even
care how stupid I'm gonna sound but I'm
gonna ask one of my co-workers for help
even though it's like 8 p.m at this time
they're still working
because we're we can be bad about
work-life balance during customer
engagements but I was like help me
how do I add an hour to an hour in Java
like I like in.net this is like
literally a dot yeah you know ad
parentheses one like like this should it
should be this easy like I don't know
why this is so hard
um and it made me feel a little bit
better that it did take him like a
little bit of time to figure it out as
well we just couldn't figure out that we
couldn't find the right Library we
needed to get us what we wanted you did
a library for that interesting yeah yeah
I'm assuming he has like more job
experience that's like his thing no I
think he just has better Google okay
love it love it we'll get into more
about like
um
battle Dynamic of because I remember I
was talking about your your role and how
it's like you kind of always have
someone who can help you out
on your team which I really like
um and you have like maybe similar skill
sets but you might shine a little bit
more in one area someone might have like
something else and I think that's really
cool we can get more into that when we
talk about your current role so all
right so you leave this um what's up
what's the job right now so you left
Blackwell TransCore the transportation
thing and then yeah you get into the
government after
yep
what was that like every you know I get
a lot of questions about government work
people for some reason have a lot of
interest in it so I would love to hear
more about it yeah I mean there's
there's there's a lot of reason to be
interested in it which I have already
mentioned which is uh mostly immune to
yeah economic Cycles right which would
include recession so if you're looking
for a job that is like extremely stable
like extremely stable then the
government is the place for you yeah
yeah like
um
I uh like if you're a government
employee like you get a pension
who gets pensions anymore do what I mean
um it's like it's like bizarre like that
but yeah I mean when I was working at
the government I I would often joke with
people that it would take an act of
Congress for me to lose my job
and that wasn't 100 false
yeah so I can imagine it also wasn't 100
true but it wasn't 100 policy therewhat how hard was it to land the job
pretty hard okay but also why
why did you want to go
I guess into that set like
sector after
you know going through some professional
turmoil
it was appealing okay to work for a
place that's stable
um
and
yeah so I started off as a contractor
which was pretty easy for me to get that
job
um it would be similar to like you know
people starting at Microsoft as like a
v-dash right and then you know if you're
a contractor or a vdash then you just
Aspire for that you know like full badge
right like I think at Microsoft it's a
blue badge a BPA was like a green badge
um but you just want that badge that
shows like yeah I'm like legit like I
really work here
um and
it took me a long time to convert to
um a full-time employee what are we
talking with the government a couple
years
yeah okay is that yeah typical
some people like my friend Michelle I
just saw on LinkedIn she finally got
converted
she's been working there for like 20
years oh my goodness contractorwow yeah yeah it can take forever some
people never convert is the is the
stability also extended to contractors
or is it just like no no yeah okay
absolutely not so that the goal is if
you're a contractor yeah yeah if you're
a contractor you're constantly living on
a knife's edge
okay that's gonna be tough
yeah
okay so you you you land the so to land
the contract what did you just apply or
like pretty much yeah I was like through
a like you know contracting company I
think it was like
uh Tech Systems yeah it was Tech Systems
um tech systems and
yeah I feel like that sounds familiar
have they been around for a while yes
right yeah yeah yeah yeah okay they're
Nationwide they may even be
International I don't know
um but yeah they've been around for a
long time and um
they were they were like BPA used like a
whole bunch of vendors
um Tech system was was just one of them
okay so uh yeah I worked as a contractor
for uh yeah two three years something
like that before I converted
um and then once I converted uh it was
seven and a half years almost exactly
before going on moving on to your next
next thing before moving on to Microsoft
okay so the at this government gig was
it c-sharp
yes the whole time
yes and to get to Contra from contractor
to full time did you have to like work
really hard what was it was it luck what
what do you think
um
let's just say this it's not
particularly hard to differentiate
yourself at the government okay
interesting okay yeah most people are
just phoning it ininteresting to know what what can you
say about the work there like and like
now that you've worked you know you've
worked a startups you worked the
government now at like a big company
what do you think is like the major
difference working there versus the
others
well you know the government is very
locked down in terms of like tools you
can use right so like I couldn't just
like download something off the internet
and be like let me try this and see how
it works like you know I don't know
exactly what would have happened if I
had like downloaded something but like
probably
like sirens would have started and like
helicopter security would have showed up
yeah just like escort me out of the
building like
um yeah it was like it was pretty it was
pretty locked down
um and Innovation is not it's not a
thing that exists
they're working on Ancient decrepit
Legacy systems that they're just keeping
aliveand after a while you start to feel like
a dinosaur yourself did you care about
that did you care about not working on
like the latest and greatest did okay I
did okay did you always or just was it
at that job that you realized that you
cared
job if I realized that I cared
because I was like
you know at a certain point if you're a
government employee
you have to look yourself in the face
and be like
do I intend to stay here for my entire
career or not
right am I going to be a lifer or am I
going to be someone who like leaves and
I knew that I was never going to be a
lifer like I just could not turn into
some of those zombies that I saw okay
like like
the place is crawling with them
and you know that did you know that
going into it or is it something that
you realized once you were in no I did
because I was a contractor right so I
saw it as a contractor I just didn't
realize it would bother me so much as an
employee right yeah because some people
it's probably fine for them it's like
what they want
yeah yeah but
so yeah I I was like
I'm not gonna stay here forever
and whenever it is that I want to leave
my skills will be
irrelevant
to like the modern workplace okay right
like yes I was doing c-sharp development
um but we couldn't do anything new
so we couldn't use any new tools so what
were you using
do you remember
um
also nice
but it it ends up being like not so nice
so like um like
you know we're using c-sharp visual
studio uh TFS we switched um
we switched from Source safe to TFS when
I was working there like they were using
Source safe
like okay so
was that switch like a big thing was it
a big deal
oh it was it's a huge migration oh my
God it was it was intense
um and like you know there are things
like um
like there we would ask questions like
hey can we can we try to modernize some
of these like newer services that we're
building by like making them like
restful services or like you know we
have this like quick little like
application we need to write that's like
internal only can we like maybe try to
do like angular or a single page
application like something fun like
anything can you give us anything and
people be like no
just the answer to any question like
that was no
because and it was just because I guess
because he's
like these web Frameworks were newer
that's pretty much it why they
they said no okay yep
fear fear of anything new
yeah yeah I mean I guess stability plays
a thing there
or
I mean I can't see what what else it
would be
performance no
I really don't know I don't know why
they were the way that they were to be
honest I really don't and then oh I was
going to tell you because I commented on
one of your videos because you did that
rejection video
right so when I was working at
Bonneville
um I hated it like I hated it I hate
every day I hated it I was like this
place I'm gonna turn into one of these
zombies like government
yeah okay yeah okay yeah yeah
um and so I applied for a job at GitHub
how many years in to the government job
I think
gosh I want to say four okay so about
halfway let's say yeah halfway halfway I
apply for this job at GitHub
um and
I wanted this job so was it sulfur
sulfur Dev
okay yeah it was working on their Visual
Studio integration okay the GitHub
integration with Visual Studio cool
um and uh God I wanted this job I
it was one of those things where like
my dream was so big like you could see
it
it was such this big dream
um and I could taste it like how bad I
wanted it
um and I got so far like I I talked to
someone who
works or worked at the time for GitHub
they don't anymore but um I talked to
them and they were like
if you get an interview like it like you
know the the whole like panel interview
thing you know not just like the first
or second interview but the interview
they really spend like a lot of time
with you he was like if you get that far
you're pretty much guaranteed the job
okay like they don't let people in that
far unless they're pretty sure about
that yeah okay okay
um and so I got that far
and so like my hopes are like way up
you're like right yeah I was like I'm
gonna I'm gonna get this job like I can
feel it I'm gonna get this job
um did I feel like I aced the interview
absolutely not
but I did I was like well I got this far
so like this is gonna be good and um
you know I had a few conversations with
the hiring manager and you know she was
like I have to say like we're really
really conflicted about you
um and we don't really know how to
proceed okay and
they
hamdenhud went back and forth with me
for I want to say like six months and
then finally they were just like yeah
it's not gonna happen six months why
it's a long time I don't know
but was there like constant
communication or it was like maybe every
month no I mean I
you know how it is as a job Seeker you
don't want to seem like too eager yeah
yeah right it's like it's almost kind of
like dating yeah should I text her oh I
don't know I don't know I don't wanna I
don't want to seem desperate right so
you don't want to seem desperate at the
same time you want to keep the the lines
of communication open right there's like
a fine line between like keeping the
lines of communication open but not
seeming desperate yeah yeah um so I I
would try and ping like you know at
first I pinged like once a week and then
after a while I think I just like slowed
down to once a month and then after I
think like the last email I sent like
was like probably like two months and I
I it was mostly just like a verification
like I just wanted I wanted them to say
confirmed we are rejecting you yeah no
yeah um and they did they're like
they're like confirmed we are rejecting
you and I was like okay but that whole
time probably you're still working in at
the back of your mind it's like any day
now I'm out of here any day now kind of
thing no I mean maybe at first okay
maybe at first but like you know like a
month a month of waiting you're like
yeah you know what's happening yeah yeah
maybe means no
okay right interesting
yeah do you feel that like with every
kind of I guess job
opportunity I mean Oprah says that so I
feel like it's just it's just something
that's true
I mean it comes back to the dating thing
if someone's not sure about you it's
kind of like an obvious answer type of
thing okay I like interesting so
you apply to GitHub and how many
I guess you have like what two three
years left that you do at the government
gig and then why do you apply to
Microsoft or why and how
Okay so
we had
um
someone coming to uh Bonneville for like
a TFS training or something okay right
to give and to get to give us to give us
training okay right and um I saw the
email come into my inbox hey you know we
we want everyone to go to this thing
and and I was like oh
Microsoft
I want to work there
but I was like but they would never hire
me okay okay why would they ever hire me
yeah yeah so so and then I was like they
probably don't even have any jobs in
Portland anyway so I you know the like I
go home at the end of that night and
just like on a lark
I look up you know Microsoft jobs in
Portland Oregon and I find one
and Commercial software Engineers
software engineer gig okay
so
um I text our friend Scott Hanselman
and I asked him yeah
should I apply for this job I send him
the link should I apply for this job and
Scott replies hell yeah
apply for that job and he was like and I
know the hiring manager so I can give
you that warm introduction right I love
a good one direction
and like within like
few days I was talking on the phone with
the hiring manager and he was fast
tracking Me For Hire what so um
I think I had that first conversation
with him in July
and my first day at Microsoft was like
September 3rd
okay pretty pretty CR uh like two months
like two months two months yeah yeah and
I'm assuming a lot of that is like
background check and stuff like that yep
exactly
was he was the interview process long do
you remember
it wasn't long at all I had three
interviews
um all like on teams
um and
they were all like like one person kind
of asked me like maybe one hard question
because
like uh was like a technical thing or
okay yeah like one one technical
question but like mostly they just asked
me about my experience right well you
have a lot like a lot of it by then
yeah so they're just like tell me about
your experience so I told them about my
experience and you know they they asked
you the typical things like you know
what was challenging about that and of
course you lived through it so you can
answer that pretty easily but like it
wasn't any like live coding it wasn't
any like did you do any of it none of
that
zeroyes okay
interesting different approaches there
yes yes
um and then my last interview I'll never
forget this was this guy who spent the
entire interview just talking
it's like about the day or something
I've ever had
we ran out of time withit I haven't asked you anything do you
have any questions for me and I was like
well we're out of time so yeah I got I
got another thing I guess if I start at
Microsoft I'll ask you there
all right so do you do you hear back
pretty
I was like soon like right after your
interview
yeah I feel like it was like
days later like maybe three days later
um I got the phone call
um that you know they want to give me a
verbal offer yeah cool when you yeah
when you saw the the like the post of
job posting and you saw the like the
description the response like nobody
they call it requirements
responsibilities whatever they're called
did you feel like you met the majority
of them
but you applied anyway
Scott told me okay
yeah Scott told me something hilarious
actually
he was like you need a channel you're a
mediocre your inner mediocre white dude
and apply for a job you're not qualified
for
I think I've heard him say something
similar to that as well
um
yeah I think I mean it's it's pretty
real advice
yeah so you went for it and you got it
which is yeah I went for it I mean I was
just like this is this is absolutely
ridiculous right because like I'm
applying for a job in commercial
software engineering and Commercial
software engineering
um you know helps customers like onboard
Azure right
um
had I ever used Azure no
did I know anything about Azure no like
of course like before my interviews I
did my due diligence and I kind of like
studied as quickly as I could just like
just get some like basic concepts but
they were very basic yeah I can imagine
I can imagine like very very very basic
I was like I know a C sharpall right so so you you start you start
the new gig
um
do you like hit the hit the ground
running with with work what is it what
is
what is the role even like what did you
do what did it look like
when I first started yeah
um I was what was known then as a
software engineer
in industry or SEI
um okay so so this this was Glenn this
is kind of the funny part so like
I left the government because I hated it
so much right yeah and so I start
in Microsoft in the government industry
did you know that that's where they
that's where they decide to put me I
mean
I knew when they offered it to me okay
and I wasn't gonna like turn it down
yeah no do what I mean yeah but I was
like you've got to be kidding me it
follows like I wanted to escape from the
government and you're giving me a job
basically like
like still working with governmentum
but yeah so we were we were working with
government
um you know we we I did a lot of proof
of concepts for customers like I did a
lot of like devops demos and um some
cool sort of like cognitive Services
demos
um and
um a lot of it was like
um like you because we were assigned an
industry and not really like a solution
area right so like I'm I'm I would
characterize myself as more like an
applications developer and like I know
very little about things like networking
right like
to this day I really struggle with
networking I was just talking to some
friends about that I was like oh
um but I'm not a networking like CSA now
so like it's not like part of my job but
anyway
um but I had like this this big
um
customer like within government that
like needed a lot of like networking
like Express routes and like v-nuts and
all this stuff
um and and like I didn't know anything
about it so like you know I had to like
find someone in CSE that had that
expertise and then and then you know
organize things enough to bring them in
and give them the context and like you
know have them work with the customer
and like all that stuff so a lot of my
job was uh actually like not even that
technical because if I couldn't
technically do the work then at least I
had to orchestrate it orchestrate the
that the people okay that could do the
technical work did that mean that you
would still have to come up with like a
con like the concept or like the
solution and kind of give it to someone
else or
no I mean what what could I say about a
network topology so you would have to go
find someone to do it yeah I think okay
interesting
how
how frequent how common was that for I
guess amongst the team
pretty common I mean most often you were
not given you know an engagement that
had anything to do with like your
particular skill set so a lot of the
seis were just like we spent a lot of
our time not actually doing
implementations but actually like
running around trying to find people to
help us
um but we also got to do like a lot of
really fun group of Concepts so I really
liked that that was my favorite part of
that job proof of Concepts means
you just built like okay so what does
that process look like like making a
proof concept where do you get the idea
from is do you have like an initial
conversation with a customer for that
gather required yeah so like one of the
most fun proof of Concepts I did was
actually for Warner Brothers Warner
media
um and they have like you know tons of
like video assets as you can imagine
right and they distribute these video
assets internationally and when they do
that they have to you know put foreign
subtitles right
on on their on their uh video assets
um and they had no real automated way of
doing this it was all very like manually
like done and like painstaking
um
and what they really wanted was to
leverage cognitive services to
um give them like an 80 there right they
knew it wasn't going to be perfect right
out of the gate
um idioms will be messed up you you know
you've watched probably movies with like
that are in Spanish and you're reading
the crappy English subtitles you're like
yeahyeah yeah who came up with this like I I
do the same thing when I watch Chinese
movies with English subtitles I'm like
like someone's talking for like two
minutes and you get like a one sentence
translation right like it's like never
really what they said but anyway
um but I get it they wanted something
yeah yeah they want something like 80
there
um so they they um I had a meeting with
a customer they they
um they told me like hey we have this
problem where we have all these assets
we need to subtitle them we don't have
an automated way to do it
Azure has cognitive Services we would
like to see a demonstration of this in
action okay
um and so I was like okay that sounds
great it would be awesome if you could
give me like you know some
um sample of like some shorter video
assets that I can subtitle for you
um using cognitive services and they
gave me like I think like 10
um and
yeah I just ran them through cognitive
Services
um translated them fed them back through
a player
um and when I showed them
the subtitles in action like they were
like
whoa mind blown
that's so cool did that lead to uh like
a full I don't know what you call it
like deal yeah full like real it's like
a real thing yeah okay so they're out
using that now did you were you part of
the actual solution sadly no okay
interesting so before we move on I have
questions about that because the
conversations with customers
is do they all pretty much go
the same way like or or is it like
really like customer by customer like
the questions that you have to ask like
even like are some more formal than
others like I just like what what does
that look like
I think like there are some people who
are really really really good at this
okay like I'm not gonna say I'm one of
them okay but there are some people who
are really good at just like asking the
right best questions to get to the real
root of the problem
right like what is what is truly the
problem you're trying to solve
um
and once the problem has been like
clearly identified
um then the trick
is to not do what Engineers love to do
which is just to like jump to Solutions
right right like oh well we could do
this we do that we could do this other
thing like let me let me build this for
you like let me run off and do it right
like that's that's always what we want
to do but
just because you understand the problem
doesn't mean that you really understand
how they would like to see the solution
right so though you have solutions that
you can think of that would solve this
problem you still have to ask more
questions to be like
you know asking things like
okay so this uh solution that we build
like does it have to integrate with any
other systems I told you I love
Integrations
I love Integrations so like you just
have to like integrate with anything
else
um
like is there is there like you know any
constraints that we should know about
like for instance cost yeah right
um and yeah so there there are these
kinds of things that you need to sort of
like you know explore and ask and be
curious
um and uh my team calls this the
envisioning phase
so we have like the envisioning phase
for engagements which is followed by the
architectural design sessions which is
Then followed by like weeks of uh
execution and implementation okay is
that it was that how it was handled at
your previous role because you had a
different role now that sounds kind of
similar but it's still different role
it's pretty much exactly the same okay
so but what what's what what's the
difference like it's a different team
different org it's so my team was like
um
spin-off okay of commercial software
engineering so that's why we have a lot
of the same sort of practices what my
team did was we cherry-picked the good
and we threw away the bad
of the role I'm saying of like yeah yeah
yeah yeah okay so you got the you're a
little bit more niche
okay I would say yeah do you enjoy it
more this way
yes okay
interesting so but your title also
changed
yes okay so that's I guess that's where
we come full circle because you are now
uh
senior CSA right CSA Cloud solution
architect but
use
are really a software engineer
with the solution architect title
yes okay now this is the interesting
part is here's what I want to dive more
into a little bit more of what like the
role looks like do do you feel like do
you see that customers
I want to talk about like the tech part
of it like do customers come in knowing
what tech they want to use
usually typically like customers will
come in with like they they'll they'll
come in with like their um Tech stack
right like we already use jira we
already use GitHub we already use
um GitHub actions for pipelines
um but and where we come in is with okay
so that's your Tech stack we can work
with that now they want to like move
some workloads to Azure or develop new
workloads in Azure right so um
we help them with that part like within
their Tech stack
so like we don't we don't come in and
say sorry you're a Java shop we don't do
Java okay or sorry like for God's sake
the engagement that I'm on soonish is
using
um
like
bamboo
pipelines I have not heard of that
I hadn't heard of it either I thought it
was an HR software what is this what is
this like I've never seen it or heard of
it at all
um we're going with it yeah yeah we're
not we're not saying no no no no you
have to use Azure devops pipelines you
know or you have to use terraform or you
have to use bicep or you have to use
this you have to use that or not we're
not prescriptive about that kind of
thing yeah all like pretty much the only
rule that we have is
you have to be implementing Azure
workloads okay like we're not we're not
going to help you like with your AWS or
gcp stuff AWS or whatever we did have
one um engagement that had a really
interesting integration with gcp but we
were just we just did the integration
piece and it was just like a small piece
so it's not like the entire engagement
was like trying to figure out that
integration but um uh yeah like that's
pretty much your only role like it has
to be azure do
have you ever come across uh an
engagement where like your team saw like
oh
like a recommendation that
customer didn't want to implement but
you thought was
like a better option for them
yes how does that go and they just don't
want to do it for whatever reason and
then you kind of have to just do what
they want
we will we will uh it's it's a it's a
it's a fine line right because you don't
want to seem too pushy right because
like something we have to be very
careful about is um
you know we're Engineers we're not
trying to come off as sales people yeah
right so
um if you push too hard on something
then people will start to think that
you're trying to sell them something and
we're not we're not trying to sell them
something see we just we um we have this
really cool uh process that we call
um
I don't even know what ADR stands for to
be to be honest but we we write these
documents called I think it's like an
architect architectural design record
okay that's what it is cool
architectural design record ADR
um and uh we have like a like a like a
markdown template for these kinds of
um like files but basically uh you know
if the customer is like I don't know if
I want to use event hubs or I don't know
if I want to use Kafka right we would
write an ADR and we would go through the
pros and the cons of each approach
um and the document has a decider we're
never the deciders right the customer is
a designer so the customer will review
this document and like you know a pull
request right
um because it's code
um
and they'll they have to read like the
pros and cons they have to review this
document and at the end of it if they
decide we don't want to use event hubs
we want to use Kafka well
that's it that's it I'm gonna go for
yeah that's it I understand that do you
have you ever seen engagement where
you just knew they could get better
performance or I don't know cost
optimization from one way but they ended
up not going that way but you still have
to implement
yeah what happens
yeah for whatever reason people have
their reasons yeah I mean yeah that's
true as well yeah I um
I'm also super curious about the the
team dynamic because
um I guess
can you explain a little bit what a
customer what an engagement actually
looks like because I have an idea but I
feel like people would be interested in
knowing a little bit more
yeah sure so they they come to us
um as
um so we're in the customer success unit
um and so we have account teams that are
working with customers and
um when they feel like they you know
have you know some qualified opportunity
um then at that point they have to like
orchestrate teams to to execute the
solution play for that qualified
opportunity
um and we're one of the teams
that gets orchestrated okay um we focus
on a region we are not
um
you know we're not too dotted line to an
industry okay right so we work with all
customers in Latin America we don't care
what industry you're in for some reason
we seem to keep getting FSI customers
but that's not on purpose FSI what is
that oh Financial Services industry okay
okay cool yeah
um so uh but we're not we're not we're
not like any industry yeah we are any
any customer in Latin America okay cool
um
and um so you know the account team will
will contact our team and be like hey
you know we have this thing it feels
like it could be a pretty good Dev Squad
engagement right and at that point you
know my manager and his like manager
peer will like meet with a customer and
they'll start you know some sort of like
General sense of the problem space like
this is like very very high level
ideation right
um and if they're like okay yeah there's
something here right
um then at that point
um they'll put it we have like a board
they'll put it on our Board and they'll
you know move it across the different
stages
um and we're our team can run two
parallel engagements at once okay so we
don't scale very well yeah
scaling is not our Forte so
um you know based on like where we are
you know sometimes we we lose some of
these engagements because they just
can't wait for us right
um but if a customer can wait for us and
then when it gets to us you know we have
some sense of like the general problem
space and then we'll have you know a
week-long envisioning where you know I
sort of already talked about that
um we try to really drill into like what
is the problem
and what do you want your solution to
look like like what
problems does it have to solve what
constraints are we dealing with
um and then we move on to the
architectural design session another
week
um where that's when we actually start
like drawing architecture
um and you know
just figuring out the entire landscape
of what it is that we're going to be
implementing and then after that we have
six weeks of
execution
um and we do one-week Sprints which it
took me a long time to get on board with
this to be honest
but yeah one week
um
it feels
like a Mad Dash I can imagine the whole
time the whole time yeah you're just you
just feel like you're like literally
like like the crazed person seeing the
train coming and like laying the tracks
down
but there's like the speeding locomotive
coming and you're just like I have to
fill this train uh train track
um so yeah it's uh it's it's pretty
intense uh but yeah for those six weeks
we do one week Sprints um we we do
weekly demos
um we are working towards that sort of
finished
um architecture that we drew the second
week
um and of course like the architecture
changes as the engagement goes on
because you have to make
um adjustments as you go but like
generally speaking that's like what we
are aiming for yeah but at what point is
there like uh
I'm assuming I have to sign some sort of
agreement or a contract or for this
engagement to happen or what does that
look like
[Laughter]
it's just something that you don't worry
about you just do you just build the
stuff out pretty much at some point
someone's probably signed something
illegal's been involved but I don't know
how that works but that's yeah that's
cool because that's the part that
worries me about the like social Arctic
World in general is I don't really want
to have to get bogged down with oh we
got to get you to sign this we got to
get you to get hit this number or
something like that yeah yeah the good
thing for my team is that we don't have
to worry about like quotas yeah right I
don't have to hit some number of you
know consumed Revenue
I don't have any Targets like that
um and so again
um you know I feel like I helped confuse
you about solution architect roles
absolutely I'm still confused
and the the honest thing is that like
though my title is solution architect
I'm I don't act like one yeah so it's I
only have this title because I'm in the
CSU and there's no other title they
could really give us yeah and that's for
what we do but that's more like a like a
paperwork kind of issue than actually
like what you do it's not like yours you
call the Social architect because that's
what you're doing
yeah yeah they'd probably have to like
do some sort of policy change to change
your the team's title yeah and I I did I
did worry about that a lot when
um I was looking at this particular role
um I was also looking at another role
within Microsoft which would have given
me an engineering title
um and I would have been
um
like in Scott Guthrie's organization
okay so that feels like oh yeah
like aligned right I'm an engineer
you're in I'm doing engineering work my
title is engineering like all all lined
up
um
ironically that role was very little
Hands-On keyboard coding yeah see this
is the thing but I think
Tech in general is like roles are just
all over the place
yeah there's like no you like when you
target something it's like you can't
just say I'm preparing for this role and
it's going to be universally applied
like no it really is it can be like
company and in our case team to team
or or to order no I guess to the team
might be a good description yeah yeah I
mean there there are csas in Latin
America for sure that would look at me
and look at what I do for my job and be
like wow that's not what I do yeah it's
like it's not a CSA yeah fascinating I
well we've been chatting for a while now
and I'll keep you on too too much longer
I really appreciate the the conversation
I wanted to see if there's anything that
I feel like we covered like a lot here
um
and someone asked like oh if we wanted
to roll simmer to what you do like what
to look for at Microsoft but again I
think it's just
just read the descriptions because
I couldn't tell you I mean I'm a
software engineer but like you mentioned
like there might be some engineering
gigs that
don't Implement as much or aren't as
Hands-On as like your role as a CSA
uh oh here's a fun question
how important is Bash
for for your role
extremely okay interesting script like I
guess we could say scripting if we want
to make it as like General as possible
but it's something extremely you use
every single engagement
yes okay every day every day ah see this
is everything I love to hear
have you every day in that has that only
been at Microsoft did you use it
previously
it's only a Microsoft and um because
like you know previous to working at
Microsoft I was always on Windows and
you know I had to do some like
Powershell stuff but like you know I
didn't I I had a vague understanding of
what bash was like but very very very
vague yeah and only in the like God I
hope I never have to do that
do you like it
I do okay I do but um when I started
working at Microsoft and um
you know I mean so much of what we do
is like running on Linux yeah if you
want to avoid Linux and work at
Microsoft
like there are very few jobs you can
actually do yeah I mean in an
engineering sense right yeah I mean I
saw a stat recently and this was from
2020 so it's definitely more than that
like of customers who have workloads in
Azure more than 50 of those like when it
comes to compute obviously are running
on Linux
so you know and that's that's that's got
to be higher now so you can't really
Escape it do you off the top of your
head like what are some things that you
use bash for
well I run Windows
um and I use WSL
um and
like
windows I use for Outlook teams
and Internet Explorer okay and one note
okay one note
that's it I do love OneNote
um all of my other work happens in WSL
okay so you're like all of my
development happens in WSL
um like all like pretty much all my work
happens over there so like you know gosh
I mean as soon as I open it like I have
to like you know even code dot yeah or
even just move them around yeah yeah
yeah yeah okay so I'm assuming yeah
pretty comfortable working with like
different clis and like stuff like that
in general yeah I mean like you know we
use terraform a lot
okay okay I guess I should ask you like
what is like the absolute basic skill
set that someone who wanted to go and
come into a role or get into a role like
yours need
I would say like for my team
um
like really all you need is the hunger
to learn
and this is like a dream
open-mindedness to tackle anything yeah
right so like I think that
when new people join our team and we've
had a number of new people start on our
team since I've been on which like uh
almost two years now and um
I've I found that you can
split people into two groups
people who just immediately jump into
the pool okay
and people who stand by the side of the
pool and stare at it for a long time
and I only want to work with the people
who jump into the pool okay
so like that's what I'm looking for I'm
not looking for someone who knows python
Java bash like Azure workloads I want
someone who will just jump into the pool
okay like that's that's that's the
quality that I would look for like in
anyone that I work with someone who's
just like you know like the the last
engagement that I worked on we had to
use API management
um and uh it was such a big part of this
engagement we had a whole work stream
around API management and I led to that
work stream prior to this engagement I
had never even known what it was
you have I didn't even know it was a
thing
with engagements there's there's time
factored into to upskill I mean you only
have six weeks so what does that look
like it's like literally that's what I
said you're like crazy you feel like a
crazy person laying down the tracks for
a steaming locomotive coming straight
for you that's what it's like you just
but the cool thing is so like our team
has this model that we call code with so
we are coding with our customers like
hand in hand
um they bring their own like business
and domain knowledge and we bring the
Azure knowledge and we work together
right okay so after we engage they can
just take over where we left off there's
no there's no maintenance tale for us
right so that's the whole idea yeah but
the cool thing about uh you know when
we're like
okay you're going to be using you know
these workloads we're not like though we
are uh you know the Microsoft experts
um you know we we can be really open and
transparent about like our own like
lack of knowledge about them and we can
just say let's learn together
and so they can they get the experience
of like learning hand in hand and coding
hand in hand
um and that and knowing that it's all
okay
right so it's like it's okay to not know
it's part of the the role to an extent
yeah like just embrace it between
engagements is there is there down timethere has to be yeah because these
engagements are so intense
okay I I feel like when I'm in the
execution phase of an engagement I'm
just sitting here at my desk sweating
non-stop for six straight weeks
that's what it feels like I'm literally
like sweating
for six weeks
it's just it feels like that much like
stress and pressure
but it's also fun like I don't wanna
I don't want to make it sound like that
it is fun I feel like yeah
I mean I can tell you enjoy it
definitely just tell that you you thrive
like that's the thing you wanted to do
do you is this like
the type of stuff you want to keep doing
with your career long term
yeah I mean the cool thing about
the dev Squad is um like I was I was
talking to someone
um who is relatively new
um to Microsoft and like is a recent
grad
um and they're already kind of feeling
bored with their job interesting and
I was like
I mean I know how that feels
and that's not good yeah but the cool
thing about my job is that it literally
can never really be that boring are all
the do you see any similarities across
engagements or is it really everything
just completely different
I mean
one thing that seems to repeat
constantly is kubernetes oh my God okay
maybe that's something so much
kubernetes
every time we're doing like an
envisioning and I'm like oh my God there
it is again
that icon
I remember you commented on on something
like when no one knows kubernetes
they're lying yeah
that's true okay maybe that's something
for people to look out
on on if they are interested do you feel
like your role
is entry-level friendly I don't think so
but I would like to hear your opinion
I think it is you do okay what do we
consider entry level like someone who
spends six months learning the skills no
Tech experience
yeah I mean like I said the quality I am
looking for is someone who is
open-minded and willing to learn this is
what I this is what I cannot stand
I cannot stand it when someone is like
oh I'm an expert in XYZ therefore I
cannot do ABC okay okay good to know
that kind of like I mean like at
Microsoft we talk about this all the
time the whole like growth mindset thing
right so someone who is just like this
is what I do I don't do that they have a
very fixed mindset right they're
unwilling to
make a leap or do something different or
whatever
um and so for me I just want someone who
is willing to take a risk yeah okay just
try just try it sounds like people might
have more of a more of a problem
actually Landing the interview then
figuring out the role because if they do
get into the role it sounds like they're
pretty much set up for success as long
as they have the right mindset
and I guess yeah I mean our team
yeah our team is like I've talked to you
about our team like we are all like
very supportive
you know experience can vary right
across our team like some people have
more some people have less it doesn't
seem to matter we all just support each
other so like you know if I can see that
you know you're trying
and you're learning and like you need
help like help will be there okay it's
good to know it's good to know all right
I want to wrap it up there I think we
can generalize the advices of you know
go for it just apply as cliche as it
sounds I mean you just applied I mean
you got it you got it you got it I I
still have no idea why they hired meI love it I I appreciate you taking it I
took so much of your time but I could
talk to you for hours about this such
interesting stuff
um I'm sure we're gonna get I can come
back no I I was about to say people are
gonna have more questions I feel like
they're really gonna appreciate this
conversation and maybe you'll be like a
recurring friend of the channel or
something like that uh but thank you
and everyone leave your questions in the
comments and then we'll see if we get
another another one of these out
and uh peace out
