let's talk about roles I've been
rejected from I'm gonna try to recall
these from memory uh probably should
written them down but whatever
interestingly enough the first job I
applied to as a professional adult I
think I was 18 or 19. I think actually
19. was the Apple Store gig and I did
get that job so kind of kicked off my
journey as a working adult pretty well
after I left the Apple Store gig I
applied to a bunch of help desk roles
and things like that and I got rejected
from a bunch of them
and I re I remember I
spoke to like this I.T recruiting
firm like their job is to get I.T
professionals
uh jobs you know and so a lot of them
were like contract based kinds of things
and they even had
like weekend jobs for people and I
remember
that I didn't have any search or
anything like that and and the recruiter
I was working with at that firm
told me like you should probably get
something like a plus you know it
definitely helps
and I was really stubborn back then you
know I'm at this point maybe like 21 22.
uh and I I had bought the a plus book
but it was like so like massive it was
like really big book
and I looked through it in like the
first couple chapters of like this is a
mouse and like this is a USB port and
things like that and I was like I don't
wanna
this seems like a waste of time to me
I'm not saying a plus is a waste of time
I'm just saying that's what was my
mindset by the given so
I remember she told me like and I was at
this point too I remember having like
negative 200 in my bank account so I was
desperate to get anything
I could
um yeah and and I remember she calls me
one day he's like hey uh we haven't
found anything kind of like semi
full-time or contract or anything for
you but there are a couple of weekend
gigs there's one this Sunday actually
and you're just gonna need to go there
for the day they're gonna pay you like I
don't know 24 an hour and you need to
just unbox PCS and set them up I was
like all right great I can do that do I
need to bring anything
and uh she was like all you probably
need is like a box cutter I didn't have
a box cutter and so I went out and I
bought a box cutter
um and then I you know waited for the
day I wasn't really looking forward to
it but I needed the money so whatever
and then that morning she calls me like
as I'm literally leaving uh she calls me
is like hey they canceled the gig no
need to go and I remember feeling that
moment feeling just like
I have to do something else with my life
like I have there's something has to
come up like I gotta make I gotta make
some kind of a move
so anyway later on I go back on to like
indeed or I think it was indeed and I
found the help desk gig that I
eventually ended up Landing
and again I think it was at that point
just a numbers game and yeah I had like
the
technical experience from like
troubleshooting phones at the Apple
Store
but
yeah I guess it was just like a lot of
luck for that first one but anyway it
was like it's my first stint of
rejection
after they helped us gig about a year
and I started applying other roles
because I was just really unhappy
and this was even before taking my
clouds or some AWS certification and
kind of being like yeah I want to get
into Cloud I more so was more I was more
focused on I just want to get out of
help desk at this help desk gig so I was
applying to Sis admin gigs I was
applying to other help desk gigs I would
pay more that were closer because even
that first help desk gig was like an
hour and 10 commute with like good
traffic I also had like a really bad car
back then I had an O3 Mitsubishi Lancer
but on the outside it was nice but on
the inside the engine
I'll add so many issues like I remember
we had to
essentially Jerry rig the fuel pump
because it stopped working and we had to
somehow like my dad's an electrician so
he's good with uh you know those types
of things for some reason the fuel pump
wouldn't power and so it wouldn't start
to cut like when you start the car it
wouldn't power the fuel pump for some
reason so he had to like
wired directly from I don't know exactly
how he did it but I remember he ended up
putting like a switch uh by like my
dashboards like oh click this turn this
on first and then you turn your car on
because I look uh that that switch will
turn the fuel pump on and your car will
turn on later on it had radiator issues
too
later on the key broke so my when my dad
ended up help my dad ended up helping
was we got like um this was army knife
and kind of just like stabbed it in
there so my key my key was this army
knife for a while yeah that was terrible
but anyway it made the commute much
worse right
so yeah I was looking for help desk
kicks that were closer uh sis admin gigs
things like that
I remember calling uh applying to this
role like a sis admin assistant admin
gig and I was like I really want this
gig because it pays more I think it was
somewhere around like mid 20 dollars
in the mid-20s per hour and it was
closer it was significantly closer I
think the commute was going to be
something like 20 minutes from where I
was living and I was like I really want
this gig like pay some more it's closer
perfect I apply for it I think I think I
had the ability for everything that they
asked for and I remember a couple of
days after applying getting a call back
from from that number
and I was so excited and it was some one
of their HR people who was in charge uh
I don't remember their name or anything
like that but it was one of the HR
people in charge of chart of of hiring
and she calls me she's like hey calling
you back about your application uh we're
not going to move forward but I didn't
want to talk to you about your resume
and proceeded to just bash my resume
this is wrong this wrong you shouldn't
do this you shouldn't do that
feedback is awesome constructive
feedback is really great like and
obviously I I have the Insight now to
look back at it and be like okay
I did end up applying the tips that she
gave me on my resume and I'm guessing
that it helped for jobs later on
but that feedback was delivered in such
a difficult way and at that time where I
kind of felt like I was a little bit
more vulnerable because I just wanted a
way out of that gig to find my next step
I don't know I felt like it just ruined
my day I was also younger uh and a lot
less emotionally mature so there was
that but then that was another rejection
I also applied to Spotify for a support
gig there too and I never got a reply
back I felt like I got a reply like six
months later
and it was something like hey no we're
not gonna move you forward and I was
like well this is great information to
have six months later so anyway more
rejection there but
I did end up getting Asus admin gig that
ended up going to like turning into the
cloud engineering gig and overall just a
very pivotal face in my life but anyway
get this as admin gig promotion to call
engineer and around that time I was also
looking for like I want to go do
no actually this was
before promotional Cloud engineer
because I remember to get the promotion
to be Cloud energy from my sis admin gig
I really had to fight that like I really
had to make my case and it wasn't with
my manager was on my side but it was
more so making the case for on like the
sea level people
so it took like a couple months for that
to happen like once I was like oh I
deserve this I've done this and my
manager was like yes you do deserve this
let's go figure out how we can get this
for you there wasn't really a formal
process for promotion so I remember that
was months and I was getting very
frustrated
so at that time
I was open to roles that weren't
necessarily Cloud related
which I'm glad it didn't end up working
out that way because
I probably I don't know if I would have
ended up in cloud
but the possibilities there that I
wouldn't have right
so
I again applied to a spot to Spotify it
was I think I think the role was
something like SAS operations engineer
essentially you know
putting together how certain SAS
applications work uh for like internally
which I thought was interesting because
I had some experience with doing stuff
like it's like you know 365 jira things
like that
and I that whole the whole interviewing
process there
I guess this doesn't count like this
rejection because I
withdrew from the application process I
remember doing three interviews and in a
span of a couple of weeks and after that
I don't know I can't remember exactly
what happened but the recruit I was
working with was great and then I think
I didn't hear back for like two weeks
and then I heard back
and it was telling them they had told me
like oh we're searching recruiters
and there was another two weeks and then
the new recruiter came to me but only
after I was like oh I want to
I want to know what's going on like
several times and then the new recruiter
comes on it's like oh hey yeah we want
to move you on to the the final round
but this whole process had been like
four or five weeks or something like
that
and at that point I was like I'm not I
don't want to do this
so I removed myself from that uh
interview process and then ended up
getting the content promotion at the gig
that I was at so it worked out great
but that was another uh rejection I
think around this not rejection but
another role that didn't work out but
that was a good thing right
another around this time too I applied
to AWS not for a cloud I think maybe it
was a closet Port kind of role I we got
rejected from that without even like I
didn't pass into like the I got an
automated rejection let's say that uh
towards the end of my time as a
collection at that company I applied to
Microsoft for the first time
got rejected uh right up automated
automated system rejection
and then
after I joined
a cloud Guru I think towards the
beginning I had uh applied toor maybe right before I joined a club
right around that time I applied to make
sure for the second time
and this was like a direct like someone
on one of the teams got my resume sent
it over to the hiring manager and the
hiring manager got and I applied manager
got back to me he's like hey resume
looks great but it doesn't seem like the
exact fate that what we're looking for
so that was the the second rejection
there
and then obviously the third one was the
one that I ended up getting which I I
reply to like six months after this or
on that time frame again these time
frames are kind of blurry to me
um be it yes yeah overall lots of
rejection but I feel like I mean
obviously it all has worked out
and it's been good
earlier on it hurts a lot more and I'm
sure I'll face more rejections in my
career as I go on but I feel like I I'm
a lot more well equipped to handle them
but yeah just just some stories I wanted
to share
um I would love to hear projections that
you all face so share them in the
comments
and yeah I just think these are topics
that people should talk a little bit
more about
all right peace out
