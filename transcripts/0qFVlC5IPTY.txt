what is going on party people today we
are talking about this thingy here
but also if you are looking to get
started with azure learning azure maybe
you're studying for the az900 which is
the entry level
azure certification i have some good
good goodies i have some goodies for you
but i'll talk about that at the end of
this video
um yeah let's talk about how i got this
nothing has given me more imposter
syndrome
than having this award um i guess i
should start off by saying that
the mvp award is something that you have
to be nominated for
by someone at microsoft or someone who's
an mvp already
you can't like sign up for it or apply
for it or you know
i don't know it's not like a form you
fill out or anything like that
yeah you have to be nominated um so i
was nominated back
for in the for the first time back in
i want to say like march perhaps
and i had just started my youtube
channel i had a couple of videos
um the entire time of having my youtube
channel i've been consistent with like
at least a video or two each week
so i had a couple of videos back then
but i had just got gotten started
you know each video had a blog post back
then too so i had some content out there
but nothing significant so i was
nominated by someone at microsoft
and i got rejected obviously because i
didn't have enough
stuff um they were like it's great but
it's not enough for us
to judge the quality i did feel a little
bummed
but it just like motivated me it was
like now i got to keep grinding so
um the mvp thing kind of just was like
in the back of my mind but it wasn't
really like
a goal anymore because i kind of
i did get my feelings hurt i'm not gonna
lie but uh anyway
yeah i kept making like a video two uh
per week and
come like june i think june or july
um someone else from microsoft nominates
me
and um you might ask like gwen how do
you know all these microsoft people
and the answer is social media i've been
sharing my stuff
uh like all the tutorials and videos
that i've made on reddit and twitter
linkedin
instagram literally anywhere that have a
social media profile
and you know how social media is people
you know find it like it retweet it and
it gets on other people's radar and just
like that that's really
yeah that's the only answer i have um so
yeah anyway i get nominated again
towards the beginning of the summer and
it was great
i really felt like that this time
i'm like i definitely i'm definitely
gonna get this but um i don't hear back
until august 1st
so i kind of went through the entire
summer not knowing and
august first i get the email like hey
you've been awarded this and i have like
a reaction video and an unboxing video
of the award
on my channel you can go look at those
if you'd like and yeah and i got it
and then after a couple of weeks you
actually get this and then for each year
you get one of these
thingies and you also get like that
plaque thingy up there and that thing
has my name
it's pretty cool actually when i got the
award um
my parents actually hugged me they told
me they were proud so that was nice
but yeah you got a couple of goodies and
obviously the recognition and
i'm able to put like hey i'm an mvp in
my twitter bio and it has helped like
landing
um like consulting gigs and it
definitely helped uh to land
my role at acg now um yeah i can't lie
it's nice it's open be up to
you know the community of mvps and a
couple of other resources
and yeah it's been great but there's no
real secret to actually getting it
um there's no and i think i think that's
good like there's no time requirement
there's no like
amount of things you have to do or
videos you have to create or blog posts
or podcasts or anything like that
they really just judge you on hey are
you creating
consistent quality content for the
community that's really it
um so sorry if that wasn't the answer
you were looking for but that's really
how it happened for me
and i guess the best tip i can make i
guess the best tip i can give you all
if you're interested in becoming an mvp
is
really just create content that's
uniquely you keep in mind that
everything that's out there has been
done already
my stuff isn't necessarily new but i
think i do bring um
i bring myself into it like you seem you
know
my face and my personality in my videos
and i'm very proud of that and i think
that helps me stick out
so just make sure you bring you to your
content right
that's pretty much it um oh yes in terms
of the goodies that i was mentioning
mentioning at the beginning so if you're
studying for the ac 900 maybe you're new
to cloud
um i remember those times they were very
confusing very stressful
um very anxious but anyway
i'm going to be doing a live walkthrough
of that exam we're going to have some
sample questions
and we're going to go over the answers
we're going to talk a little bit about
tips
and just have fun we're going to study
together that's going to be live on the
acg
youtube channel i'm going to leave the
link in the description that's going to
be february 2nd
i don't remember the exact time but
again like i said the link will be in
the description you can come hang out in
the chat
ask questions uh we'll be there to help
you out
so let's study together right also
i released some more azure fundamental
videos
on the acg youtube channel and one is
about setting up budgets and billing
alerts i don't know if i've ever told
this story on the on the channel but
when i was a junior cloud engineer um at
that role
uh we had like we had time to kind of
just play around and experiment with
stuff and just learn
um so i had once been playing around
with i think it was cosmos db
and i racked up like a thousand dollars
over i don't know if it was a month or a
little bit over a month
because i had forgotten to remove the
resource after i was done playing with
it
and luckily my boss was you know still
is a fantastic guy and he was like don't
worry about it
um but yeah if i had to end up
uh budgets and billing alerts that would
have never happened so now that there's
this video
i'm very happy to share this as a
resource for you all there's also a
video on securing your account with mfa
and such
that's also there i'll link all the
stuff in the description
oh and if you are studying for the az900
the actual az900 certification course is
free for you to take so it's an entire
certification course
for you to indulge in
for free um as you can see i'm studying
for my epic one and i'm trying to share
more like updates on
like you know when i'm done studying or
you know what i covered and such
not necessarily like full videos but
just like posts like you'll see them in
the community tab here on my channel
i'll share a post like hey i just
finished studying what are you studying
talk to me
um as much as i love hearing from you
all and what you all studying about
it really helps me keep myself
accountable um just knowing that
you know there's people out there who
kind of look for uh like a gentle
reminder like hey gwen's studying maybe
i should study two or something like
that
it really helps me because i struggle
with studying every single day um
i sit down and i'm like man i really
don't want to do this i'd rather like
play like far cry or gta
but you know it's something we all have
to get done right so just sharing those
little updates with y'all really does
help me so that's been great
and that is pretty much it um
yeah a bunch of cool stuff we're doing a
lot of azure stuff this month with acg
very excited because you all know i
freaking love azure um
and yeah anyway that's it for this video

twitter at made by gps
