so there's sort of this
famous saying that you're not supposed
to stay in a job for more than two years
at tech
i don't necessarily agree
but i think it's a good guideline
so for example
earlier on my career a year and a half
was around the sort of sweet spot for me
it was enough time for me to become very
comfortable with my skill set but also
enough time for me to not feel like i'm
getting too comfortable or bored at work
so help desk a year and a half my
sysadmin and then cloud engineer gig
was almost two years a little over
a year and a half i think somewhere in
the middle between those two and now
microsoft i'm about i'm over a year at
my current role but i
don't i still don't feel like i'm
comfortable here
in in my current role so it might take
me a little bit more time to get to that
spot where i'm like oh i want to see
what's next for me um
so for me definitely a year and a half
or so is
sort of my sweet spot in terms of like
okay let me figure out what my next
steps are
two years i could also see that being
applicable especially in this current
role for myself
anything less than a year i think could
potentially be a little tricky but i
understand people leave jobs in roles
earlier than a year for a bunch of
reasons
i think the absolute earliest that i've
ever left a role is six months like my
gig at acg
six months in i left but i only left
because the conditions to join this job
at microsoft were just everything was
aligned and it was the role i wanted and
everything so i had to go for it
but you know when you think of like
think of your first year at a roll
you're spending about three months
with um onboarding and whatnot let's
consider another month of like i don't
know vacation
holidays
uh i don't know
time that you're not in the role for
whatever reason and then there's only uh
what's that four months total so there's
only eight months left of the year for
you to really have time to own your
skill set in your current role so that's
why i think in less than a year you're
really not giving yourself enough time
to
know absolutely everything that you can
of the role and that way you can you
know take that that skill set and
showcase it into another interview or
into a next role or make your case for a
promotion or whatnot all those kinds of
things um
yeah but that's my opinion and it's sort
of what has worked great for me i would
love to hear other people's experiences
and sort of what framework and what
mindset do they have when they're
thinking about okay what's my current
relationship with my role and where do i
want to take it next or when do you
start failing that way because it's a
question that i get a lot and i would
personally like to hear from all of
y'all
so yeah super short video but
that's my insight on that i will see you
in the next one
