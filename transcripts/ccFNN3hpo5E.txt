everybody i'm going to show you how i
made this magic mirror it's not a
tutorial because there's plenty of
documentation it's an open source
project
i think it's magic mirrors.builders but
i'll link all that stuff
in the description this is mainly just
kind of like a vlog style video of how i
built this
uh yeah i have a lot of cable management
to do and such uh
basically i just have vga and then power
connected to this power strip that's
mounted
and the raspberry pi is also mounted
onto the door and it's just a single
cable going up
to like an outlet uh i want to clean it
up more
and the mirror i want to put some
material on it
that makes it darker because you can
still differentiate
the display from the actual gloss
and the modules i have are just my
calendar and then
whether the pokemon daily pokemon and
then one that i made
which is daily so quote and then spotify
whenever something's playing it'll
display on here
i want to create another one that will
go like in this section
that'll show me some azure uh like my
monthly azure bill here
and then maybe something else here i
don't know but uh that might be a
different video
uh so this is a raspberry pi 4. you're
most likely familiar with this
little thing it's basically a tiny
computer and this is an old display that
i have
that i don't use anymore because it's
just vga and it's really old
it's not that great quality and i've
just got it hooked up to like
a keyboard and a mouse and actually vnc
is on this so i can use vnc viewer and i
have it on my main laptop
which is you know i just remote into it
but uh what i want to do
is take the guts of this of this like
display so basically just have the panel
and then i'm gonna put it behind a
two-way mirror
material and i'm gonna make a magic
mirror um you might have seen a bunch of
posts
about this tons of people have done it
alright so probably first good step
would be to maybe load on
like a built-in module[Music]all right so i'm gonna open up spotify
we see
it's loaded on here and if i changed it
to like this one
it's pretty responsive nice like most
things in my technical toolkit i've
learned them by
looking at other people's examples that
are online and googling stuff so
since i have very little experience with
node.js that's what i'm going to do so
shout out to the people who
make their work available online for
others like us to
learn from this is i'm just looking at
someone else's repo
that is a great way to
you know learn stuff just looking at
what other people have built
[Music]all right it looks like i had a few
typos but now let's go
and run it again and
let's go thereoh it's still oh it worked holy sh isn't
it it workedoh my goodness i was about to lose my
mind there let's go full screenthe mirror has arrived so the display is
kind of i didn't really take it apart
you can see that
the still like the front border is still
on it
um but this is mainly just for like
testing purposes so i rotated it
um originally i had it like that way and
it was going to be you know
the other um orientation but this kind
of looks cooler
because i feel like i can just mount
this and i get more of like a
full body view um so just picked up this
case
well it was just delivered to me uh i
think this was like 10
on amazon it actually looks pretty neat
like has a nice clean look to it and it
comes with a little fan that you can
attach to the pins that are on the
raspberry pi
and it keeps it cool so now what i'm
going to do is take off this
frame from the display if you guys do
take a part of the display
there's a lot of these ribbon cables
that are connected like some of them
might be hidden so you want to make sure
to disconnect them all like for example
i have this one and this one
and this one here just connecting before
he actually takes off apart
our little change of plans i'm actually
going to go ahead and see if i can put
it in the door
i've recruited some help
what are you thinking dude you think
it's gonna worknicethis is what
let's seeand here we have the finished project
again i want to put some tint on
the mirror because since the display is
a lot darker and the mirror is actually
quite clear
you can see the display pretty heavy
through it but if i tint
the mirror it should uh should look well
also the back needs a lot of work cable
management and such
but again just to get it mounted and
start actually like building some cool
modules uh
does the trick looks pretty neat
