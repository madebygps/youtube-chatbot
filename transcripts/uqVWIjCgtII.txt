hey what's going on everybody today i
want to list five mistakes that i've
seen that are sort of like popular or
common um when people are getting into
cloud
i sort of just based this on my
experience of being i guess part of the
community but also working in the space
for almost like five years now uh with
all that being said hi i'm gps and
welcome to a new video
alright so the first one is not using
budgets i have several videos about
budgets talking about how to implement
them and i think like the biggest
mistake that i made in my cloud
engineering career was i think i got a
bill over
over like a grand maybe a grand two
grand because i forgot to
uh delete resources and i would have
been alerted if i had budgets in place
but i didn't have budgets in place right
so here we are but i would say yes
absolutely make sure no matter like what
quantity of like this is like a
an account that you use just
for development just for playing around
or anything like that no matter what it
is
make sure you
uh have a budget in place i'll have a
video i'll throw it up somewhere um
and you will know how to do that
but yeah definitely make sure you
understand how to
implement budgets implement budgets and
have them in place as well right
the next one i would say is not using a
cli or not having linux skills or
command line skills in general like so
let me show you let's switch to my
screen here yeah so this is the cli and
i want to just delete this group delete
this uh rbac demo that i just used for a
demo right that's literally all i had to
provide
goodness
as i make a mistake right uh let's go
back here i just need to do n i think
all right then i hit yes and then
that'll delete the group versus actually
me having to go into like
portal.azure.com
portalportal.azure.com
then signing in
then going to
my actual resource groups
then finding the resources you know make
sure it's filtered correctly all that
stuff blah blah blah blah right you get
what i'm trying to say make sure you
have uh you know everything that you're
implementing with tutorials and when
you're getting learned like you're just
getting started with cloud and you know
maybe you're saying for certification
whatever it might be any examples of
things that you see done in the portal
look up the commands and how to do them
on a terminal on a command line and use
those okay solid i have a bunch of
sessions that i've done for the past
almost two months that use a lot of cli
things take a look at those alrighty
mistake number three that i see is
not documenting your projects
i wish i would have had blog posts or
videos on every single thing
that i did when i got started
because i look back now as like a
technical content creator i look back at
all the beginner content that i could
have created that has so much value
because
it's extremely weird rare to find
beginners creating big content on like
their beginner level like beginner level
content is always by people who are like
intermediate or higher up there
uh but like documenting your projects
and the things that you're getting
started with or doing is extremely
valuable and it's also a way for you to
look back
on your progress share with others you
know develop a portfolio and sort of
grow your online presence which i tell
you all this all the time i got my job
at microsoft because of this youtube
channel because of the things that have
happened around this youtube channel and
i highly recommend you have a blog or or
uh you know twitch channel or a youtube
channel whatever it might be whichever
platform you're comfortable with maybe
it's tick-tock maybe it's instagram
whatever it is
just document your stuff in some sort of
way right
um
yeah do that i have a i have a github
repo that sort of has this outline of
how to start your own channel in seven
days i'll link that somewhere somewhere
and it's sort of just like this i guess
day by day kind of program i guess
um well it divides up
like all the tasks that you need to do
over the goal is to get you from nothing
to a chan to one video published on your
channel in seven days so if you are
interested in youtube take a look at
that
but yeah document things like
why you're learning this what challenges
what didn't work what did work things
that you want to improve all that kind
of stuff it's fantastic or maybe explain
some concepts whatever you might be
right
um
the next mistake i see a lot that
beginners make is not consuming
non-tutorial content and this sort of
goes into
the topic of developing who you are as a
like with your people skills like a
human being who's a professional in
cloud right um i mean by like uh like
reading books
are not necessarily tutorials but maybe
more about like the business side of
cloud or um something like i don't know
the phoenix project the unicorn project
tools and weapons um
just books around technology in general
um in cloud in general
or podcasts like the cloudcast or
there's also
every single cloud platform has podcasts
as well um consuming that kind of saw
that isn't something that you just have
to like step by step by step like
tutorial but sort of it gives you more
context as to like why services matter
what things or what news things have
happened as well it's going to make you
more of a well-rounded professional i'm
not saying that every single minute you
have to sort of fill with this
non-tutorial type content but i've been
i've gotten a lot of value from
like podcasts and news and staying up to
date with just what's happening and it
also helps me
fear feel fear feel less fomo when it
comes to topics around cloud because
it's like i'm in the know of what's
going on i don't necessarily um i'm not
going to spend time learning it i'm not
going to become a professional every
single thing that happens but i'm in the
know when there's an update uh when
there's new tech or stuff like that
right
so that i think i would say i would
highly recommend you not just go down
a rabbit hole of tutorials but you know
diversify okay all right the last
mistake i feel a lot of y'all make um or
a lot of us when
or when i ma i made as well as a
beginner right i'm not trying to put the
blame on you i'm just trying to give you
a heads up uh it's not participating in
community
i'm not saying you have to become like a
tech twitter influencer or anything like
that but you know sharing your stuff
providing feedback sort of networking
with your peers building sort of this um
network of people that you
are like close with online or in the
cloud space things like that is is
genuinely very valuable and it's not
just like oh the job opportunities that
you could get which i've gotten several
because of my presence on like twitter
and youtube but also like the friends
and and the colleagues that you can make
like for example learntocloud.guide
which we're now turning into a web app
is being built by with two friends of
mine antonio and rishab and we all met
through twitter right um a lot of
colleague people who are now my
colleagues from microsoft i met them on
twitter and things like that right so i
think you're sort of doing yourself a
disservice if you're not at least in the
know of these communities that are
available there's like there's reddit
there's uh twitter there's linkedin
there's tick talk there's there's so
many sort of cloud communities out there
that you can become part of
and i feel like not not only just like
knowing more people but like sort of
getting your eyes more eyes on your
stuff um it's for free it's just
available for you to do out there why
not
i'm going to throw a sixth one sixth
thing to this list which is umnot
wanting to learn to program
i think when a lot of people sort of try
to get into i've heard from beginners
like i want to get into cloud because i
don't want to code or i don't want to
like
learn how to program and i think you're
only doing yourself a disservice um by
not understanding like the fundamentals
of a programming language
mainly because the things that you can
build with code is just amazing of
course there's other things like low
code no code and those kinds of
solutions and i'm not saying it's not
worth learning those things but really
when it comes to like cloud and
automating things you're going to be
using something like bash or powershell
or python to script your tasks anyway
and you're going to learn a lot of
fundamentals that can lead you into
programming from there and taking like
an extra step i know it takes a lot of
time i'm currently sort of re-learning
how to program with russ i told you on
the last video
um yeah it takes a lot of time but then
when you can sort of build literally
anything because you're not a program
it's going to set you up for success
right um so i would say like don'tdon't not want to learn how to program
right um but yeah anyway those are sort
of my five or six uh things i want you
all to watch out for
um
and yeah if you have any questions
recommendations comments any of those
kinds of things you know where to leave
them i will see you in the next video
