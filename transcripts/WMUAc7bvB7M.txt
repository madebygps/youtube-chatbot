hey everyone today we are covering three
cloud roles i'm going to try to outline
a potential career path into these roles
certifications that might be helpful and
sort of skills and responsibilities
you'll be using day-to-day
i'm going to try to cover like the most
popular ones that i get asked about but
if you have more suggestions for roles
that you want to see me cover that
aren't in this video let me know in the
comments
uh two things i want to mention before
we dive into it i know cloud engineer is
probably the most popular role out there
i just want to say that cloud engineer
is extremely generic at one point in my
career i was a cloud engineer all it
really means is that to some capacity
you're going to be working with cloud
infrastructure and cloud platform and it
could end up being any one of the roles
in this video or even roles that i don't
mention in this video
so yeah keep that in mind and second
your potential in landing any one of
these roles will increase exponentially
if your people skills are on point
if you can interview well if you can
communicate your technical skill set to
a technical audience and to say like a
business team or to a team that doesn't
interact with the tech stack every day
overall if you're just someone who
people enjoy working with
you're going to have a better chance at
landing these roles right
all right with all that out of the way
hi i'm gps and welcome to a new video
all right let's kick things off with
cloud administrator so if you're a cloud
admin you're someone who's focused on
maintaining already existing
infrastructure
that your company or has in place maybe
it's been developed or built by a
different team and then your goal is
really to just be there and making sure
everything's smooth sailing on the
day-to-day in terms of a career path if
you're already sort of like maybe a sys
admin a network engineer in some sort of
operations role you can 100 leverage
your existing skills and talent into a
cloud admin role uh helpful
certifications would be the aws
solutions architect associate level
the azure administrator az az104 and
then google has the google cloud
engineer
this is the only associate level uh
certification that they have available
so i'd recommend taking a look at that
pick the one for the cloud platform that
you're interested in
when it comes to administration related
certifications it's more about sort of
having a wide range of knowledge a bunch
of different cloud services instead of
going in depth with any of them
cloud admin roles tend to be more entry
level friendly
which is great for people are looking to
break into
the space but that's also why they
expect you to have sort of wide range of
a bunch of different services instead of
being like an absolute expert in maybe
like a smaller range or things like that
right
you're going to need to be able to uh
like you know understand infrastructure
and application monitoring uh things
like new relic data dog azure monitor
aws cloudwatch et cetera
in your day to day you could find
yourself reviewing or querying
monitoring data making sure
infrastructure your applications are
running smoothly and as expected
you're going to need to script tasks
with some sort of scripting language
python bash
or powershell
you know things like creating new user
accounts new cloud accounts
with the proper permissions or uh
perhaps creating infrastructure that
someone else or some other team has
provided for you
you're going to also need to be able to
work with other you know other team
members or maybe it's a different team
things like that to understand how you
should maintain new infrastructure
that's being built or implemented
and things like that and you're going to
need to know how to work with cost
management and budgets
implement new budgets for new projects
and generate reports on
costs if someone asks you hey like how
much did this service cost
the past two weeks you need to be able
to generate that report
uh i think that's pretty much
what a cloud admin does
all right on to the next cloud architect
so a cloud architect is someone who is
focused on planning
a
well-built
cloud solution cloud project uh they're
often
i would say maybe like i don't know 90
of the time people with years and years
of experience and people who have
on other projects been like the
developers the the administrators or you
know what not
because when it comes to architecting
you need to be able to answer the
question like what's the best tool for
this job and if you haven't worked with
like a bunch of different services on a
bunch of different projects you won't
know it's just like inexperiencing right
so they're not as
entry-level friendly as other cloud
roles so just keep that in mind so in
terms of a career path you could
probably leverage if you're already in a
cloud role uh your years in a cloud role
into a cloud architect
uh role but again
it's probably gonna be hard if this is
something you're interested in as
someone who's new to the space but some
helpful certifications would be the
microsoft certified azure solutions
architect expert i believe it's two
certifications and then there's the
google professional cloud architect
and then there's the aws solutions
architect pro i think all of these
actually require two certifications the
google one may not i
google it i'm not 100 sure
that one but yeah you're going to need
to like design monitoring design
security solutions to kind identity
design storage design business
continuity design infrastructure
everything so if someone tells you hey i
have this application i need to deploy
everything that goes around it how
people access it how do you just secure
it where just where is the storage going
to be like what regions do we need to
deploy and what yeah like what are our
disaster recovery plans all of those
things you need to be able to design
those things right
so this is why it's sort of necessary to
have a good knowledge of an entire cloud
platform like in and out you need to
know that thing in and out on to the
last one for this video which is cloud
developer uh so a cloud of air player is
someone who is focused on sort of
building solutions using cloud services
uh and if you
like to program and code and things like
that this is the role for you
in terms of a career path if you're
already say a software dev or in a role
that you program a lot you could
definitely leverage those skills and i
would also say that developer roles are
entry level friendly maybe not as much
as admin roles but
so pretty friendly
so some helpful certifications for here
would be the aws certified developer
associate and the azure developer which
is the 204
and i think
google professional
developer cloud developer or something
like that they don't have an associate
level one i don't know why google's like
that that's just the way they are um but
yeah you have those certification
options pick the one for the platform
that you want to learn
you're gonna need to
understand uh
application monitoring so similar to the
admin that the admin is a little bit
more focused on infrastructure you're
going to need to be more focused on
application because in your code when
you're developing solutions you're going
to need to be able to code things that
will send
logs and data to your monitoring things
like that uh you're gonna have to be
able to work with
i said that weird you're gonna need to
work with
uh command line tools so your cloud
platform via command line tools
and uh also work with your cloud
platform and your cloud services with
sdks software development kits
all cloud platforms have different sdks
whether that be java c sharp python
javascript things like that uh build
server solutions so getting hands-on
with something like aws lambda azure
functions it's definitely a plus low
code and no code solutions is also
something i would recommend looking into
things like logic apps or the power
platform when it comes to azure
i think aws has like
step functions or cloud functions
something like that
but yeah low code and no code is sort of
definitely something that you can
leverage here uh storage and messaging
solutions like you need to be able to
save data somewhere get data from
somewhere and messaging is sort of the
services that will connect all your
things together so understanding
messaging uh and database services as
well
and of course you're gonna have to build
your solutions in a secure manner so
understanding how applications can
implement security uh to like log in or
access other cloud services is important
for you to know as well
and that is it for this video i've
covered three if you want me to cover
more maybe we'll turn this into a series
or something like that just let me know
in the comments thank you for watching
and i'll see you in the next one
