today i wanted to talk to you about the
certification that had the most impact
on my career
which might be interesting to know that
it's not actually a cloud one and it's
not actually the first one that i took
see the first certification i took was
the
aws certified developer associate and
this was when i was in my help desk gig
before moving into my sys admin gig
i spent six months
studying for that and i actually
recently found my notes
like the pdf that i have on the notes
that i took for that certification
and i was sort of surprised to realize
that it was 61 pages long it's on learn
to cloud if you go to phase 3 resources
you can find them there but
yeah i learned a lot from there but
it didn't necessarily turn into like the
most impactful or the one that i learned
the most from
because i went from setting that
certification and moving into a gig that
used azure
so it did help my resume it did help me
sort of do well in my interview and i
did learn a lot of core concepts
core like cloud concepts i didn't really
put into practice any of the aws
specific things right
fast forward to
i think it was the beginning of last
year where i took my linux essentials
certification
and to this day the things that i've
learned in that cert
is are things that i use
i can
confidently say
almost on the daily
and what do i mean by this
like the
i've always known that understanding how
to use commands a command line
and
a cli and things like that
have been very important
i just never learned it in the order
that i would recommend beginners learn
it now like i tell
i tell everyone to sort of put becoming
comfortable with a command line at the
beginning of their journey into cloud
now
and that didn't happen for me until like
the beginning of last year which is like
a few years into my journey
now you know
just today i was working with learning
bicep which is an infrastructure s code
tool with azure
and i realize that i'm doing all these
things in the terminal i'm comfortable
using grab i'm
comfortably doing
like creating pipelines and redirection
all these things and that's only because
i took my linux essentials and i spent a
month studying
making like blog posts on every single
command practicing all these kinds of
things
and i learned it really inside out i did
very very well on that certification
and it was so rewarding so much fun it
was just a month dedicated to learning
like really really learning the command
line
different commands and such and to this
day i use it
so i highly recommend you study for
it you don't necessarily have to take it
um okay you don't necessarily have to
study for that specific certification
but i think the commands that you are
required to know about for that
certification are absolute essentials
and that is my quick cloud tip of the
day
understand the power of the command line
and it's going to change
your your skill set and your technical
ability
and for the better for the rest of your
journey here in cloud
all right
maybe i'll do another quick video
tomorrow i don't know but i will see you
in the next one
