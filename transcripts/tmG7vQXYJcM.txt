so i made a tick tock that went
mega viral and i mean in my
opinion
uh on my tech salary progression going
from 2014
15 an hour to now 2022 so eight years
there
making a hundred and seventy five
thousand dollars base salary i didn't
talk about stocks total compensation
anything because i feel like when people
start to talk about that it can get very
confusing um so yeah i spoke about base
salary and whatnot and a lot of people
had a lot of questions
and a lot of people asked how i made
that jump from helpdesk which was
sixteen dollars an hour so about thirty
thousand dollars a year
to junior sis admin which was my first
salary job at fifty five thousand
dollars a year which was for me a
significant jump in a significant amount
of money so in today's video we're going
to talk about to me it's four skills
it's
learning a ticketing system
documentation learning powershell or a
scripting language and getting a cloud
certification
so i'm going to address all of that in
this video
with all that being said hi i'm gps i
like making cloud computing videos and
videos on career and just things that
i've picked up along the way
don't forget to like and subscribe it
really does help and it helps me to keep
you know creating free content and
whatnot and welcome to a new video
already so like i mentioned my helpdesk
gig i was able to land without a college
degree and without any certification so
no a plus which is a typical like help
desk certification that people get
i had one and a half year 16 months to
be exact of experience and at a retail
store at an apple store to be fair the
role there was a technical role because
i was sort of helping people with
iphones and ios problems and mac os
problems and whatnot and we did use a
ticketing system so the whole
troubleshooting mindset the whole
documenting issues and whatnot i learned
thanks to that gig
and i also do very well at interviewing
so i'll do another video on that too so
with that experience plus my
interviewing skills i landed my help
this gig but no other no educational
background and whatnot
the helpdesk gig started i believe 16 an
hour so
the entire time that i was there i was
probably making somewhere around 30 to
maybe like 32 000 a year
and there was no
stocks or bonuses or anything like that
i didn't really encounter that until i
joined microsoft which was is my latest
job
but
the the jump from thirty thousand
dollars a year to fifty five thousand
dollars a year was significant and
significant money for me too and there
was four things that i did to land the
junior sysadmin room
so the first one was
learning a ticketing system that is used
at many many companies uh there's a
bunch of them but the one that i knew
specifically was jira so i knew not only
how to
use queues in jira how to create tickets
in jira how to you know
add documentation to jira but i
towards the end of my helpdesk career i
also got insight on how to like create
your own workflows in jira and a bunch
of other things on like how jira
actually works so that was definitely a
plus going into my genius admin gig
because that place was using jira as
well and they were going to need help
creating workflows and things like that
so my help desk gig
plus one on that also
along the lines of using a ticketing
system was creating documentation on
absolutely everything that i could so
any
problem that i was able to address and
fix and resolve or even not resolve
at my helpdesk gig
we were supposed to create documentation
on it that way as if someone else
encountered the issue they could just
use the documentation that you created
and save a lot of time right because
help desk is all about
figuring out issues as many as you can
and as fast as you can
it's not really in-depth engineering
it's more so just volume kind of thing
which also teaches you how to work under
pressure and deadlines and whatnot and
for me it was a fun challenge because it
was it used to be like oh if i can take
sort of four issues an hour
can i challenge myself to get to five in
a couple of months can i challenge
myself to get to six in a couple of
months and whatnot so
yeah creating documentation and creating
documentation that was easy to share so
other people could easily read the
documentation there was there was
documentation on
what the issue was what i did that
didn't work and what i did that did work
all these kinds of things including them
uh was great so that was the second
thing
the third thing
was having a which with getting a uh
what was it oh a certification cloud
certification so for me it was the aws
certified developer associate
certification i got this question as
well the other day about oh should i go
for the solution architect associate or
the developer
developer associate i personally find
the solution architect certification
boring and it just feels very like
theoretical to me where the developer
one was a lot more hands-on in my
opinion and i had a lot more fun
studying for it i studied for both but i
only sat for the developer one and i
passed that one
but there's a lot of overlap between the
content for both of them
but i learned a lot and i learned what i
needed for my junior's admin gig from
the developer one but i also took my
sweet time i took like six months to
study from a certification
and that these days is unheard of like
you'll go on linkedin and you'll see
people who pass certifications every
week every month and then you can tell
that that's just not a real way to soak
in knowledge that will impact your
career for long term like you really
have to take your time i'm not saying
you have to take six months it could be
less but
don't just sit for certifications by
memorizing because you're not really
going to get out of them and they're not
cheap right if we think of
most cloud certs are at least 100 plus
right some of the like uh comptia ones
are like 300 400 right but anyway
that certification helped for my junior
cis admin gig because that gig in the
job description they were asking for oh
well you might if you're interested in
cloud
then you'll have plenty of projects to
work on because we're migrating so on my
resume i had my certification and then
during the initial phone call
the hiring manager asked me like oh yeah
i see that you have the certification
are you interested in cloud and because
i had recently passed that and then i
knew everything about the certification
i like talked a lot about it
and a lot about cloud computing in
general saying like yeah i'm very
interested in that
so that was another thing that made a
huge impact into landing the role
and the fourth thing was knowing a
scripting language so in my case it was
powershell now do i recommend powershell
if you're working somewhere that you can
get exposure to powershell by all means
go for it but you're if you're at a job
that you can't get any exposure to any
kind of scripting language and you're
learning on the side i would recommend
to go with bash just because bash is
used for linux machines and linux
servers
tend to be more used in windows servers
so it's more so kind of like getting
your best bang for your buck in terms of
what you're studying for
so go for bash but
i didn't get too much experience with
powershell
it was more so like my own kind of
scripts it was more so working with
scripts that other people have written
or seeing other people create scripts
and kind of them taking time with them
for them to explain things to me
but i knew how to execute scripts i knew
sort of being able to open up the script
and see like what it like i could piece
it apart i could like google things like
oh what does this command specifically
do and i could understand what was going
on and that made an impact into landing
my junior this admin gig because
sys admin roles are all about automating
things
uh you can think about like especially
like let's let's say like a windows shop
which was the sysadmin gig that i got
they use windows and azure
like automating 365 things automating
active directory things automating
things on virtual machines all that
could be done with powershell so having
that knowledge
and that experience even if it was a
little bit
uh it was enough because again the cis
admin gig was a junior so like mid-level
or i guess entry level uh because his
admin roles typically are sort of
mid-level either kind of roles that you
get after support
but before you can get into like full
engineering and whatnot
um not saying that you can't land your
first role as a sysadmin it was just for
me it was more so like a mid-level kind
of thing um
yeah but uh the hiring manager was more
like as long as you're aware and you've
worked with these tools before i don't
need you to have extensive experience
with this because i understand this is
still like an internal mid-level role
but those were the four things that
really made an impact for me and again i
really recommend you
know how to take tickets know how to
document your issues get some sort of
certification that will help you go
towards the role that you want to get to
in my case it was the aws certified
developer associate
and then learn a scripting language if
you can get exposure to a language at
your role whatever language that is do
it
and if you can't learn bash all right
that's pretty much it i'm going to have
a bunch of other videos following up
about how i did what i did to go from
junior sysadmin to cloud engineer
then cloud engineer training architect
and then training architect and now my
gig cloud developer advocate at
microsoft and i do also want to talk a
little bit about
um
base salary and total compensation
because there's a lot of questions
around that as well
i can talk a little bit more about
certifications education what not things
like that if you have any more questions
leave them in the chat and i will do my
absolute best to well in the comments i
will do my absolute best to answer them
and yeah thanks for watching and i'll
see you in the next video
