um actually
maybe not that badhow we doinguh mic check two two oneBennett
Christopher what's going ontime to do a little workso this is what I got going on here
what up JPum
here we go so
you all are probably familiar with the
cloud Rosemary challenge here's mine
and then the counter's not working so
we're getting an error not name not
resolved
I also want to add a project section
here
so
let's see what we can dolook at that JP and
Christopher in Brazil that's awesomeall rightlet's take a look here one second y'allI don't even think I have this code on
this machine like I haven't worked on
this project in a whileuh resume Azure is no easy dude
no I don't think I have thisit's time to go to GitHubuh
share with my stories I don't even
remember resume let me see it's one of
these
I don't know if it's this one or this
oneresume it's yeah it's probably this one
it's a refactor
to.net.net sixyeah I should be this one all right so
let's get this code hereI get clonealso what we can do is do like a z
group listuh not let's do AZ group list
output table
and
strg
it's not in this subscription
let's do AZ account setI don't know hold onI have to find the right subscription
because I don't think I'm working on
that one
when I joined Microsoft they gave us
like monthly credits
um so there's like a certain amount of
credits that you can use every month for
like your own things to learn and
whatnot
um and I remember that that subscription
was a different one than the exist like
I had to create a new subscription or
something like that
so now I gotta go find what the name of
that isuh it's called it's called Microsoft
Azure okayall right so easy account set dash dash
subscription
and then we'll do that
so if I do a z group lists output table
Cloud resume challenge here we go all
right so AZ function app
um
function app list
and the resource Group actually G
Cloud resumeit's made challengeokay so there's no function in there
that's probably what's going onum
all right so I have the code and I think
I just have to getI think I just have to provision
the CI CD to a new function appso let's take a look hereCD Azure resumeum
let's open this up in codeI'm looking forward to that video from
earlier I haven't gotten a chance to
watch it yeah yeah
the developer CLI is awesome
I
want to package
this project this resume into that oneumso it'll be a lot easier so people can
just do like ACD
up dashes template and then use like
this template and then they'll have like
a full implementation in their cloud
uh hold on let me answer some work stuffif you all are on Twitter did you all
see that that boot camp boot camp
scandalhey GPS how much do you spend monthly to
maintain your projects online I'm an
absolute beginner following your video
about how to be a cloud engineer
um so for example this this resume
project runs for like less than a dollar
a month
um
I probably I'm looking to run the the
cloud dictionary too that's probably
going to be some like 10.
20 a month
with like moderate amount of traffic
um
yeah but I don't really so the
difference is I don't run
stuff too much
like I'll deploy them and then once it's
done like for whatever use case or what
demo or whatever it is I'm using
then I'll tear it down and then I'll
have just infrastructure that's code so
I can bring it back up wheneverokay back in region done at six we're
using Windows function app
um so that's why I don't really spend a
lot monthlybut the goal is to make the cloud
dictionary project to be one that runs
every month to have like a real product
in production
and like my hero project uh so yeah
let's see done at six so we just need a
Windows function app
I'm going to use a portal for thatuh
go uhresource groups I have this open another
one another one uh just because I don't
want to switch this
yeah create
function appfunction app create
uh I would highly recommend
serverless projects
uh let me see if I can get the same name
here
back in six what's the name of thisget visitor counter so we're going to
call it the same thing get visitor
counter
uh
runtimestack.net.net six ISO
is this isolated yes this this is
isolated right hold on is this isolated
uh I mean if I did it it's probably
isolated
let's take a look here back and API six
to get counter yeah this is isolated
okay cool
East us2 Windows consumption
all rightmtbf yeah that mtbf
boot camp
like I just keep reading more and more
tweets about it and I just I'm just like
so surprised of how much fraud and scam
went into that boot camp it's crazyum that the book The this is I'll put
this in chat
here
uh so this is the cloud resume challenge
but if you're looking for the serverless
resume API
um that's I'll give you this one too
serious resume API
this one I and this one is cool because
the resume API is built in a way that
you just follow the steps and you'll
have it deployed whereas a cloud resume
is more so just an implementation that
isn't documented in that way and this is
also using Code spaces so you don't even
need to download anything locally I've
provided a
um a Dev container configuration with
everything that you'll need so it
installs and then restores everything
for you
so I think this is actually a pretty
good project for like if you want to
spend a couple of hours on a weekend or
something like that getting some
Hands-On stuff
so do check that out
uh all right so what was I doing I was
creating a functionso what's going on here is I erased that
the subscription where the function for
my counter because here it's supposed to
have like a counter uh
I erased it on purpose
um like the the descript the
subscription is disabled or it got
disabled on purpose
so now what I'm going to do is just
deploy a new function to a subscription
that is enabled
um and this is better too because I was
before I had multiple resource groups so
now I'm just going to have one Resource
Group
um
which I think is better
it's a little more organizeduh hold onokay so let me see here deployment is in
progress looks good
all right let's give that a secondeasy night wait hold on taking my easy
900 this week that's awesome
that's a great first step
I constantly tell people that the 900 is
not like some people try to undervalue
it but I remember taking that one and
barely passing and that was with like
two years of azure experience so so
great it gives you like I was talking
with Lucy about this when we were
streaming the other day but more than
anything it just introduces you to
learning cloud and how to study for
certifications how to take
certifications and I think that is a
valuable skill set on its own
what up Jay
what's going on everyone all right so
I've deployed my
I've deployed my function app
cool so now if I run that same command
that I did before which is this
This Cloud this thing you see I get a
result here I can probably even do
something like
hold on there's so much information I
don't need all this information I just
need the name of itwhat is the name of this thing let's see
app service plan do do enable host host
type
it's probably just name right oh yeah
yeah okay so then if we did something
like
query Dash Dash
querythen we'll do do do name
name
close this close this
we're gonna get that visitor counter
here
clear I'll do that but one more I'm
telling you y'all so understanding James
path
so like the reason that this query here
works
this this works like what to put in this
double quotes once I understood how to
actually do that it's such a better and
more efficient experience using a CLI
when you can actually filter through
what you're looking for
and then you could probably do something
like
I'll put tsv
and then assign that to our variable
which I'm going to do so I'm going to do
font actually can I
how do I assign variables here I don't
think I can do that
can I do because I'm not in bash
technically I don't know if this will
work yeah I don't know how to do it in
the windows one
I'll probably have to do it in like WSL
let's do this hereuh what framework did you use for the
front end application
I don't remember let me see
front end is probablyoh it's just HTML
HTML is good old HTML and CSS that's it
and some JavaScript that's itset oh you can do set okay sweet let's
do that then let's do set
function
oh sweet how do I print this out though
it's not Echo right
okay can we do
is it like dollar sign function
no oh my goodness hold on
how do I Echo
function is it like that no how do I
Echo itwhat up Garcia Echo function that's not
working in I'm in Windows terminal
I I I need to be in Bash that's my
problem
hold on AZ account
set subscriptionit's called like
what's it called it's called like
Microsoft Azure subscription
so oh goodness hold on setokay clear so now if I do
the same commands that I was trying to
do here
uh this year
I can do this here
but I want to do
uh function equals and then put this all
inside of
um
and I do Echo
function
oh no I did this wrong hold on I just
want it to d uh
[Music]
I think I have to do this
how does it just return
like thatthere we go perfect
look at my bash skills I'm getting
better at this
okay so nowlet me take a look here my workflow my
back end I got that good visitor counter
check out Azure credentials your secrets
credentials work sign and version find
under version five Azure function
package path that's fine
Azure function app name Azure function
app name is fine Azure function package
path Azure functions
I probably need to update the publish
profile so go herea secret actions
to do credentials is probably fine I
need this
so let's get that
um I have I actually have that here I
have the command that I need to use
uh this one here
all right we're gonna paste that in
there and I just need to change
the resource Group is cloud resumechallenge Dash Resource Group
uh and then the function name is
whatever I saved in the function
variableah what did I do wrong hereCloud resume oh my easy group list
what is the name here
oh it has dashes in it okay
cloudresume
challenge like that
okay cool that works and I copy this
here
and then I go to my actionsupdate that secret
my security key
this is what I use
for
authenticating so much easier I mean so
much better than MFA I mean like
authenticator appsit would be nice if you review our Cloud
resumes and give us some tips send them
send them
learn to Cloud guide gmail.com send them
and I'll review themokay cool
soI actually don't think I'm I didn't make
any changes here did I I think I'm cool
with everything that's here
probably what I'll need to change
eventually is
the app settingsokay let's go into actions
deploy backend.net6uh uh we'll just we'll can I run this
from here no can I where can I run this
from
oh no there's no like on workflow okay
we're gonna have to go tohere actually nolet's go here code workflow backend six
and then I'm just gonna add
onworkflow what is it workflow dispatch
this patchoh no this goes up hereI think that's the right one that might
not be the right one I know I configured
something similar to this up herecode good for close Builds on we'll
follow this patch okay I'm just missing
this year
start commit commit okay
[Applause]
let's see if this worksuh done at six now we can do a run
workflow see so adding that workflow
underscore dispatch to the on which will
allow you to have this run workflow here
so let's see if it actually worksthe code should work
though the code probably needs to be
refactored like if I'm looking at this
like I'm pretty sure I could make it
like clean it because my.net skills are
definitely significantly better now
so we'll take a look
so if you are sending me your resumes
make sure to remove any data
that you don't want me to publicly show
like you don't want to dock yourself
remember that soall rightso it's running let's see if this runs
successfully I don't think I've ever ran
a GitHub workflow GitHub actions
workflow successfully on first tryso how's everyone doing let me see Echo
probably I got so I got tired of trying
to figure out the windows terminal
proper command to print out a variable I
just went I just switched into WSL
W cell is
freaking awesome I love it I love it
uh also good news good news I finished
my rough draft on my outline for my
Linux bash course
right now it's looking to be around 25
videos and I ran it by my potential
co-host so we're going back and forth to
kind of like Define it it's so hard to
pick what should be
what should be in like a beginner
curriculum
um
but that's kind of where we're at at the
moment
but that's going wellall right let's take a lookjust a random question what is your
internet upload speed I don't know let
me take a look I'll do I'll run a speed
test railuh
well it's going
W still stopped me from buying a Mac I
have a Mac
I have an M1 Pro
that I just feel so bad that I bought
because I don't use it because just
Windows is perfect for everything
I think I'm gonna sell it
umI don't know
yeah it's just like sitting there it's I
just feel like it feels like and I hate
wasting money so
it's kind of like one of those purchases
that pisses me off that I made
umwhat up udx uh my bad Echo oh you need
the percentage signs you're right you're
right that's how you do itmy download is 142 my upload is 0.09I don't know if that's good or bad but
that's what I gotuh so let's see if this works I like
doing these one-off Cloud projects with
y'all
um
that's cool because I don't really know
if it's gonna work but we're gonna debug
it live all of us together
uh we're running the functions action
I wonder if this needs to be updated
we'll seelet's take a look look so another
Improvement I want to do with this
workflow is right now it's deploying to
a Windows Azure function I want to
deploy it to a Linux
functionbut I can I can do that pretty
straightforward I don't know if I'll do
that today but I do want to do it
maybe your streaming's eating that
upload by the way 0.09 my voice is Tiny
probably
but hey it's working
yeah
umwhat laptop are you using for day to day
I have a custom PC
I have a um
I have a 2060 card AMD ryzen 5 32 gigs
of RAM two terabytes of storage
uh I've got like a water cooler those
kinds of things
um
I just think for the amount of money oh
my goodness it worked I just think for
the amount of money uh it makes more
sense for me to
put it into a custom PC because I don't
move around a lot for work I have a
think pad I have a p14 that thing is a
beast so that's the laptop that I use
when I go to the office I'm actually
going to go to the office tomorrow do
you all want an office tour video
but I'm gonna be there tomorrow so I'm
going to take my laptop with me but when
I'm like here here I have like multiple
display got a custom PC over here
um
I'll probably do like a new setup Tour
on my Vlog Channel
um so yeah all right uh it looks like it
works let me look at this here
hereuh overview refresh
so something came in there's some
activity hereuh let me show you all this
so there's some activity here so if I go
toleft side functions we should see it
here here we go get visitor counter
but this probably doesn't workbecauseit doesn't have
uh
uh the configuration
so this probably needs
access the cosmos DB it probably also
needs access toum let's take a look
so let's go back into our good old codeTor would be cool yeah
um I'll do I'll do I'll record maybe I
don't know no promises
API net six uh let's look at our
okay uh give us their counter and let's
see which ones are they referencing
so we need a connection string cool so
let me add that
where did my
I'm going to add them in here
I'm going to move this over herewhat up doorsuh okay
like thisuh application and then I need to go
find my Cosmos DBconnection string
anyone have experience with Cosmos DB
so I've used both the SQL API and then
the mongodb onethere's pros and cons to both of them uh
I think I like working more with the SQL
API specific to Cosmos DB because it's
sort of like a native experience the
cosmos DBA API I find that it lacks from
like the actual like up-to-date Cosmos
DB
uh where are my keys here copy this here
okay and then I also need
okay that connection string that's fine
uh I wonder if we need storage I don't
think we need storage
let's see go back in here counter
I don't think this is referencing
anything collection name because we're
we're hard coding in which I shouldn't
do but for now that's fineum
anyone else here in Seattle area
sometimes I wish I lived in Seattle
because I would have access to so many
just Microsoft people like to just work
with in person I think that'd be so cool
but I don't really like
Seattle weather or
the area in general
uh okay so now if I goall right it works people so now I have
this hereum that looks like C sharp this is C
Sharp I am a C sharp developer you are
correct
so if I refresh thislet's see if it works oh hold on I think
I might
need to enablecourse some more tools developer tools
yep I knew it so I need to go here here
uh hold on here
if we search for if we search for course
oh it's right here
I need to add it from
this pagehere here submitoh wait wait wrong one wrong
that's the wrong one we need to go to
the function
go to Resource course search it hereuh uh where where to gowhy is it not showing at me oh here it
is
boom
there
save okayuh I agree wait wait what is it are your
chats live typically available on your
channel after you finish them yeah
the the live the full lives are
available
publicly but then I get I get um
I have my editor do like summarized
versions that but those are available
only to members but the full thing the
all the content
um is available publicly after Okay cool
so now if I do let me put this over here
if I refresh this here let's take a look
uh
website called oh here we go it works
huh
so a couple of things I want to add I
want to add a projects section here
and then just showcase like two or three
projects perhaps
but I'm not gonna do that now at least I
know that this works so that's coolthat's a little a little Cloud
[Music]
um
a little Cloud action for today
so yeah people I'm gonna send this over
for y'all if you want to build your own
highly recommend it and then I also
recommend you do this one the serverless
resume APIum
boom
uh probably start with this one because
it's like a smaller scope
uh the serverless system my API has a
smaller scope but you're getting
Hands-On with similar services
but this one I also built it in a way
that you can follow it as a workshop
um
and like you have like you're using a
bunch of commands and all those good
things here all right so let's now
switch intofull screenuhlet's seeokay coolwhat happened let me close this let me
close this
I hear my girlfriend talking really loud
on the phone in the background it's kind
of distracting
uhuh okay coolall right let's answer some questions
people
what do we got what do we got did
everyone see the boot camp fraud scam
going up on Twitter do you use it did
you use a template
um
wait hold on
oh my they're doing another mtvf space
right now I don't like I can't be in
Twitter spaces for more than like
20 minutes because then it took us too
chaotic for me and I'm like I gotta
bounce
anyway did you take your resume style
idea from some website uh I believe I
did I believe it's a template that I
mentioned somewhere
um like in the instructions oh at the
bottom it says template by CV
uh and then that links to the template
there so if you go to the footer of my
page you'll find it there
uh let me go back here yep yes I use the
template yes yes I did because I have no
skills when it comes to CSS or design in
general so
let's see how do people learn what
constant changes and updates so for me
I'm kind of like in the flow I'm in the
flow already of just always doing
something in Azure so it's easy for me
to kind of like be like okay today I'm
learning this service the next week I'm
like doing this but it's all like very
related
like I will like and I can always
like so like for example functions Azure
functions is a service that has several
Integrations with other Azure services
so
it was it kind of easier it makes it
easier for me to learn other Azure
services in relation to functions
um so it makes it easier to pick up
something new
so I'm kind of kind of just in that flow
of like every all the time just working
on something
but it's definitely like a it's like
you've got to take it easy you gotta
like become comfortable with thatlast night they kept muting folks
talking over each otherthat that that boot camp scam is like
just crazy I mean I stand by
my opinion of I just don't recommend
boot camps in general
unless I have
done them firsthanduh what did I miss hereI just started studying for my aac900 on
CBT really excited that's awesomeI just found the ACG video for build my
resume is that a first group Club
project I have in ACG sub yeah it's a
good first Cloud project
um I'm the host of that one the Azure
resume one when I worked at umwhen I worked at a cloud Guru I did the
the Azure version there's some updates
obviously because that was like you know
over
two over a year and a half ago
but if you keep if you look at my GitHub
repo all the codes up to date so that
would be good
hey I discovered your YouTube channel
like a week ago how I became an itvid
thank you a lot for your work I've
already learned a lot it's awesome
by any chance you have a video on your
OS setup no that is like a good I got
I've gotten that request too
like my kind of like developer setup uh
the tools and things that I use
so I could potentially do that I mean
I'm just like I'm a big
WSL so via's code okay let's do
WSL vs code
um I guess okay Ubuntu and WSL vs code
Azure CLI
and then and Asher that's kind of like
my stack
um
I use a thunder client inside of vs code
a lot for like API calls
if I need more features I use insomnia
but thunderclient tends to do like the
majority of the workyeah I've been playing around with using
def containers a lot more too
so I'm not installing stuff locally
yeah
Ubuntu is great
uh
uh what is the name of the boot camp
that did the scam it's called like
MB MB something and be something my tech
best friend mtbf there we go
my tech best frienduh yeah I got tired of this college name
here boot camps on Twitter ad so I wrote
a post to drive them shared it on the
MTV after
oh I gotta check that out
Ubuntu is great it is great
why does Ubuntu why does everyone like
Ubuntu because of its compatibility
I feel like a super user user friendly
and I think as like a first distro
and actually not just first distro I
think just as like if you wanted it to
be your day-to-day your daily driver
it's a great distro for that
um there's like a lot of documentation a
lot of just Community around it too
personally like my top tier like my
absolute favorite is pop OS but I don't
think there's a pop OS option for WSLwhy does every oh hold on
I can't leave the light oh yeah hello
are you afraid of recession layoffs will
start hitting Cloud devops jobs they
already have like Microsoft like my
employer laid off like 2 000 people in
August 1 000 people recently I'm pretty
sure more are coming
um every day I kind of feel like oh
today I might get an email and I might
not have a job anymore
um but you know I as you can see from my
financed videos like how I spend my
salary in those kind of videos I'm
pretty smart with saving so if something
did happen
um I would have a backup plan for a
couple of months
what's up yeahsuper great compatibility how do you
like hold on hold on hold on how do you
like the.net ecosystem
so funny story with net I first was sort
of obligated to learn it when I was
working as a CIS admin because it was a
small company and they needed some help
on
I think it was like an MVC project and I
didn't
want to I don't know because I I had
done some like research on like C
sharpen.net and then
um I think I just saw a lot of
like people saying it's Legacy is old
don't learn it you're not going to get
anywhere
but and then I was like oh can I I want
to do like python like Python's the
coolest thing like I wanted to do it
but
then I kind of sat down and I thought to
myself like oh well if you're don't want
to do.net you're not going to get this
project and you're not going to get the
experience
so I ended up obviously learning doing
there but it wasn't like my first choice
it was sort of
like an opportunity brought on to me
so
yeah and ever since then it's just like
the tool that I've been leaning into
more and more mainly because it's like I
already have experience with it and if I
have the option to pick a language I
already know
and then I can spend time upskilling in
other services instead of having to
worry about the programming language and
that's what I'm going to do
I'm not in a field where like the
specific language or like the
performance or the optimization or
anything like that matters
um so yeah
but if I didn't know if I wasn't leaning
more into.net I would probably want to
become a rust developer
super a great compatibility in the best
region fruit boot into it yeah it just
works it works fantastic
like it just and that's what you want
with an operating system
how often is degree required for it I'm
I'm with a company at 19 as an
apprentice
I mean it can become a hurdle but
you can get into it with that oneuh
uh what made you choose Azure over AWS
because the place that I was working at
so I studied for AWS first so I spent
six months studying for also I spent six
months which is unheard of nobody these
days spends six months studying for
certifications
but I spent six months studying for my
AWS certified developer associate
and then I landed a job at an Azure shop
and they were like you can get as much
Cloud as experience as you want but you
got to learn Azure you got to do it
Azure I was like all right cool so then
again it's the same thing I had momentum
and I was able to lean more into Azure
as I continued like moving in up and up
in my career so yeah that's why
uh let's see herewhy doesn't the language and performance
matter in your space because
I do a lot of
umhow do I explain it like I do a lot of
demos
um or like or events or product work
where the language is already kind of
selected so I'm not like a technical
lead or a solution architect defining
anything
so I kind of just come in and tag in or
on projects.net is already what's being
used
um
and they have selected.net for whatever
reason is so I mean the re so I probably
should reward that
I'm not in like you know when you're
building like command lines or you're
building like underlying infrastructure
or you're building like I don't know
these tools that are meant to or
projects apps whatever that are meant to
be super lightweight like like rust as a
language comes to mind that's used a lot
for that type of work
then you would probably have to go with
a different language
[Music]
um
so that's why I say it doesn't matter
for meuh
uh so so about the school thingif you have the opportunity to go to
school and you can afford it and you
feel like that way of learning is the
best for you go for it absolutely
but if you have the slight hesitation
you're like I don't feel like this is
for me then just know there are other
options for you to learn okay you don't
have to absolutely go to school
there are benefits from going to school
like networking and obviously having a
degree does still have some value
but you can definitely get into it
without ityou learn a cloud inspired me to host my
owntrue Nas on KVM
hype Liberty hypervisor hosted on my
Ubuntu Server current to play next Cloud
on true Nas then offside backside on
blob storage that's awesome that's a
sick project right there
Anyway by some blog posting completely
new but I know I know I will regret not
blogging or documenting on my cloud home
lab projects just been knocking them out
to be honest
that is sick so I I would say if you
already have any projects that are like
you're done with
um take take a take a second to like
reverse engineer it in like blog or use
videos
um and kind of just speak to
how you put it together any challenges
you encountered any things you would do
differently any things you want to
improve
um for further projects like I think it
would be really sick if you had like the
approach of oh like this I'm building
this and this week I did this Pro
progress next week you know it's kind of
like as you go I think that would be
super sickuh but like don't feel like one blog
post needs to cover absolutely
everything like it can be as specific or
as general as you need it to be
um but definitely if you set out to
create blog posts I would say if it's a
series try to complete it
um
yeah
and just don't have like these massive
goals for each post I would say that toouh wait where are we this is so awesome
I was literally just trying to do this
challenge a couple of weeks ago yeah so
once this live is done you can go back
to the beginning of of the recording and
see what I fixed what essentially what
had was broken was I deleted my phone no
my subscription got disabled that my
function lived into it but I had been
meaning to move that function into the
new Resource Group where all the other
resources for the challenge live so
today what I did was just create a new
function and then make sure the GitHub
the GitHub actions workflow was
deploying to the correct one
I want to do another stream where I'm
working through the code and making
improvements because I've learned a lot
more.net and functions since I
originally created thisyeah sowe're using azda on your Cloud resume
not no not yet
um that was actually something that I
mentioned that I want to put this all
into
easy D all I really would have to do is
Define the infrastructure as code with
bicep
and I have already a lot of bicep files
that deploy to blob storage that deploy
to because the static sites on blob
storage and that deploy to functions the
only hard part I think I'm going to
encounter it's probably going to be a
pain is the front door stuff
but I've been considering moving it from
Azure front door
because I got an email saying like oh
Azure front door classic is getting
retired so I'm gonna have to move stuff
anyway uh moving it to something like
Cloud Fair flare
so we'll see
how that goes but yeah I would love to
make this an Azure developer template
that way people can do azd template
Azure resume and then have their own
implementation ready to gouh I'm gonna use your suggestion as
video blog posting with weekly progress
updates easier to particularly my words
than spilling my thoughts on blog yeah
and don't feel like you have to be too
polished
um
like I wish I would have documented more
of my career earlier on
but I was so scared of coming off like
if I would have documented my help desk
days my Sid to admin days and like early
class engineer days
I feel like that content would have been
so much more useful
than
like any of the technical stuff that I
do now
not to say that the technical stuff that
I do now doesn't have any use but I just
feel like there's a lot of stuff that
one figures out in their career that you
take how you kind of take for granted
and would be very valuable to look back
on but also to share with othersuh let me see here okay awesome well for
sure I think let's see bicep is the
thing that kicks my butt mind if I check
out the infra directories let me drop
you some some URLs here that are like
that'll give you uh insight as to what
so I have some in front in here
um
so I said in friend here so if you take
a look at this one
this one's just deploying functions and
storage application insight
boom but let me also show you theum hold on the azd
template
where are you
to do C sharp SQL
playlists hold on
sequel Funk yeah take a look at this one
here too
this one's deploying a lot I think this
is the playing on static web apps
uh so you have front end and back end
here
so that's a good one
yeah but I think
bicep was a little tough for me to to
learn but it wasn't untilum like working on the Azure developer
template like the to do SQL SWA Funk one
that I was like okay I finally
understand this
you're using Main and resource I saw
some of the templates like yeah use that
SEC look at that second one like when I
worked on that
um there's a bunch in there there's like
app there's core
um they have parameter files
and this one doesn't have a resource but
it opts to have a bunch of different
modules there's a lot in that one that
was a tough one tough oneyeah it's like with with bicep or with
infrastructure is code it's like
if if you can have so much like the goal
is to have so much abstraction
like it's like oh can I make this it's
sort of like the way I think about it is
like when you're when you're developing
like a website and you're using like a
component based framework and your
mindset is like oh should this be a
component or should this group of things
be one componentlike it's like the same concept that I
have with like bicep and modules like
so yeah but anyway take a look at thatI'm a simple man give me three services
and I'm out yeah
the good thing is like once you figure
out like a massive thing like this like
you're gonna reuse a lot of it
like I never
from scratch do a deploy a bicep uh
fashion functional device like I'll
always just reuse it I'll just copy
paste
uh I'll try to I'll try to look I'll try
to do the azd that would be a good video
though
Azure developer template for the cloud
resume
it's just it's just the front door stuff
that's gonna kick my buttyeah
let me see how long have we been
streaming for 53 minutes all right
I'm gonna sign off y'all because it's
been an hour and it's family time I
recently adopted a cat
let me show y'all a picture
of my cute cat uh I recently adopted a
cat yes yes so I gotta go give my cat
some attention
hold on this picture here
look
that's my cat her name is ZoeI gotta go give her attention she's
actually on the couch right now which is
right behind my camera
um but yeah I have to go give my cat and
my partner attention very important so
whenever I do my next stream maybe then
we'll put together some bicep
infrastructure
peace out everyone
oh and don't get scammed by boot camps
