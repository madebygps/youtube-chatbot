hi everyone welcome to another video
where i
answer the most popular questions
comments that i get in my youtube
comment section area gwen
i've got the certification i've been
following these
certification courses i want to get
hands on
what are some projects that you
recommend i've got a list of three
beginner friendly projects that will
give you some hands-on cloud experiencewhat i will preface this list with is
you're going to get the most benefit not
only for yourself
but perhaps for other people by just
documenting what you've learned any
difficulties any challenges
any things that you that like stood out
and became super interested
in or something that you want to
continue looking into anything really
about the process of of
like learning these projects or doing
these projects you know throw them up on
on an article on dev too
or on hash note or you can use your
github or if you have your own blog
whatever it is i'm not telling you to go
start blogging every single day or
you know creating youtube videos or
twitch streaming all the time no
absolutely not
but you will get a benefit out of
documenting what you're doing
and sort of building this online public
learning space for yourself
because not only are you someone else
could learn from you but also
you learn more when you write out or
when you talk about
something that you've been working on
also
it's like a little plus that you can add
to your resume like hey
i also you know blog about this or i
write about the stuff that i work on
here you know just saying
just saying anyway the first project
that i recommend
obviously you have an account on aws
azure gcp wherever it is
you have an account right right i
understand that they are these learning
services out there that provide sandbox
environments but if you are
serious about cloud computing you need
to have an account you just need to
all of these cert these platforms have
free tier and services that are free and
some of them have
like free credits when you sign up for
like a certain amount of months
you get free credits go do that
and once you have your account or if you
already have your account
spend some time looking into cost
management and set up billing alerts
set up budgets because the number one
question that i get from clients and
right away is
how much is this gonna cost sure
working with new technologies and tools
and services
and programming languages is really cool
but that's cool to us
that's cool to us as developers as
engineers
whatever clients want to know the money
aspect how much is this gonna cost me
how can we save or what's like what's
the implemented budget
or you know how can we prevent it from
going
over budget stuff like that so figure
that out for your own account
and please document this somewhere
i don't think i see i see enough
articles on like
serverless or you know building this
with some new front-end framework
solid i get i get that it's interesting
but there's not enough of like the
basics and
and most important stuff like cost
management so go do that
go set yourself up for success and also
it helps you when you're like
building stuff and playing with your own
account and your platform it helps you
not go over budget and then you end up
with a bill
like a thousand dollars because you
forgot to erase something so
you know that's your first project go do
that second one
a resume api uh my friend richard
actually uh brought this to my attention
during serverless september he built a
resume his own resume
an api of his resume using azure
functions in javascript
the language and the serverless function
offering is irrelevant you can do this
in
you know lambda for aws or cloud
functions with gcp
azure functions with azure that doesn't
matter
i'll link some articles that have uh
examples for
azure and aws you can follow us if you
want but this is cool because
personally i don't have like a per like
a website
like i have where my made by gps.com
where i have like my study notes and
stuff that i write about
in terms of what i'm earning and such
but i don't have like my resume online
so this became very interesting to me
where it's like it's just an api so it's
just text
i don't have to really design anything
and that has always been my issue with
anything front and related really or
anything that you needed to be able to
look at
because i can't even draw a circle i'm
terrible at ui
but this also gives you exposure to
something like serverless which you hear
me talk about all the timei don't want to sound like a sales pitch
but serverless is definitely something
that is just
gaining so much momentum so much
attention and support
and this is a great project for you to
go get hands-on with that
so yes resume api i will have articles
for that i'll have articles for these
projects
in the description or maybe i'll put it
in like a one page on a blog post or
something so it's easier for you to see
all of them
anyway and the third one i don't know if
it's because i'm looking
for it more but i just see a lot more
articles and
questions and conversations about
terraform and i know it's been a
popular tool for a whilebut get hands on with terraform luckily
their website their official website has
it getting started for all the major
platforms
and there's sections in there um you can
you know you'll use the cli you'll build
infrastructure
you will delete infrastructure all that
jazz
and again follow that that's a nice
project to like kind of get started and
then eventually you can just start
deploying infrastructure in your own
account
just via terraform i know there are
other offerings i know for example azure
uh
azure resource manager templates are
very popular as well
but i think terraform is your best bang
for your buck in terms of
you know learning one that can work with
all the platforms
so yeah that is your third project go
go through the entire getting started
with terraform on their website
and a fourth one which is not
necessarily a project but i would say
if you want more ideas you can go to the
100 days of cloud github repo and
there's an ideas repo there you can grab
one
go through it it'll give you like a time
estimate kind of like a category what
the project is about
i know i've uh i've i've contributed a
bunch of project
ideas on there and then you can
contribute as well i'll link the youtube
video where you can go
uh contribute a project there as well i
think that was also a great way for you
to get hands-on with github
if i'm with git and github if you're not
familiar with that
also super important um but yeah there
there's kind of like
my list of things that i think you
should be able to do
right as you start getting interested in
cloud
yeah anyway any questions comments
feedback
just want to talk cloud uh hit me up on
twit uh
yeah twitter i haven't been too active
on twitter lately
but uh yeah made by gps or leave it in
the description
uh catch me on a twitch stream i'm
always in you know active
when those things are going on you can
just hit me in the chat with something
uh if not i will see you in the next
video see you later
