a cloud administrator is the person in
charge of maintaining and provisioning
certain cloud infrastructure you'll be
expected to develop a lot of high level
skills and not necessarily
dive into or specialize anything or into
anything specifically now
i think this is what makes the cloud
admin role
a friendly role for people who don't
have much
tech experience and are looking to break
into the cloud computing space but don't
let the broadness or the general
sense of the role scare you away because
if you come into the role knowing that
you want to specialize and go into a
specific cloud discipline
in a cloud admin role
you will most likely get exposure to
that discipline to some extent
you can sort of think of the cloud admin
role like
your first couple of years at university
except you're going to get paid right
personally this is a route i took and
it's a route that i've seen other people
take including colleagues that i have
now at microsoft
like all cloud roles it really is going
to depend on the structure of your team
the size of your team uh what you end up
being tasked with and of course your own
performance but my goal for this video
is to explain the cloud admin role and
tasks and skills that are generally
expected
from cloud admins and provide you
resources that you can use to learn
those skills
with all that being said hi i'm gps and
welcome to a new video alright so the
name of the game for cloud admins is
provisioning your goal is to set up the
infrastructure
in the cloud following best practices
via something like a cli
so that's using commands or putting
commands together and creating scripts
with something like powershell python
or bash or maybe even taking it a step
further and learning a full-on
programming language if you like it's
not usually a full-on requirement to
know a programming language for a cloud
admin role but it doesn't
it doesn't not help
especially if you want to specialize in
a cloud discipline like cloud developer
devops engineer sre learning a
programming language is absolutely going
to help with that
but yeah your goal is to provision
infrastructure into your cloud
environment and once it's provisioned
providing the correct access to
whichever team needs access to it right
so for example these data science
virtual machines right
i'm going to go provision it to whatever
specification i was told that need these
virtual machines need and then i need to
make sure that the data engineering team
is like hey data engineering team here
are your virtual machines here is how
you access them right
now
in terms of creating that access
properly and securely you're going to
need to understand whatever identity
a service your cloud platform uses so
for example azure active directory is
the one that azure uses so you'll need
to know how to properly create users how
to properly assign permissions to users
and applications you can also see in
this diagram we have like a managed
identity that would be through something
like azure active directory as well
and i would also tag along to this is
cost
management in terms of like
understanding or knowing how to find how
much a service is costing knowing how to
implement budgets and alerts i believe
is also super important for a cloud
admin
right so again the name of the game
provisioning
you're setting up the infrastructure and
then giving the proper access to
whichever teams needs access to that it
might sound easy
or relatively straightforward but there
are a lot of
sort of high-level areas that you need
to develop here so for example we have a
networking aspect because look here we
have network security group we've got a
v-net
we've got a firewall i need to
understand what these things are before
i can provision them so having a solid
networking foundation i believe is very
important here
there's also a foundation in scripting
and using commands as well because
that's what you're going to use to
provision this infrastructure right
i would also say cloud fundamentals very
important understanding cloud best
practices like i just mentioned identity
cost management all these kinds of
things very important as well in another
area i would like to tag on to sort of
what a cloud admin needs to develop is
a good understanding of devops practices
usually cloud admins cloud developers
and cloud devops engineers will work
hand in hand the cloud admin will do the
initial setup and then in terms of
automating any updates to that
infrastructure that was set up by the
cloud admin the cloud admin will need to
talk with a devops engineer and they'll
be a back and forth until that pipeline
is smooth in terms of resources that i
recommend to use i've summarized all of
this if you go to learn to cloud dot
guide you'll find it there i've broken
it down into a couple of phases there's
four here
linux networking scripting like i
mentioned programming fundamentals cloud
platform fundamentals and devops
fundamentals
you could potentially skip the
programming one if you have no interest
in going into a discipline with cloud
development whatsoever you can skip that
and then just do one three and four or
you can do whichever one you want really
this is more so just
the way i recommend each phase will tell
you why this how this applies to cloud
how to break it down some resources some
projects and some things that you need
to be familiar with in terms of every
phase
yeah so name of the game for cloud
admins is provisioning there's also some
maintenance in there too
for example if a hard drive is becoming
[Music]
full on a virtual machine and no one
knows why it might be your job to go in
and figure out what's going on there if
they need some sort of task automated uh
something like a a virtual machine needs
certain files to be moved from azure to
the virtual machine locally
you might be tasked to do that with
something like powershell and a z copy
or something like bash et cetera et
cetera right so there's a lot of
maintenance things in there too and
again when you think about those
sort of tasks that i just mentioned
there's some scripting in there there's
some networking in there there is some
um
like being able to go into the cloud
platform and check the logs and
monitoring for oh finding out what's the
issue with the disk getting full right
uh again cloud admin high level lots of
high level things not specific in any
one area but that's the beauty of this
role is that you'll get exposure to a
bunch of different areas and who knows
what you might end up liking you just
gotta keep an open mind
all right that is it for this video the
next one i think i'm gonna do is cloud
developer and then we'll do cloud devops
engineer
but yeah thanks for watching i'll see
you in the next one
