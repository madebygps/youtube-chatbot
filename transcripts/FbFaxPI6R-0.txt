thank you all for asking me these career
questions
it makes creating videos a lot more
sustainable because i can fit them
throughout my day a lot easier
than the very technical
focused tutorials and it's a nice mix
with all that being said hi i'm gps and
welcome to a new video
in terms of networking certifications
that you need for cloud
there aren't really any and that's
because
a lot of the networking certifications
that exist
the more popular ones network plus
ccna
certifications of that nature
are very very network engineer focused
and in the context of a ccna they're
cisco focused
not to say that they're not useful
but when it comes to landing a role in
cloud
especially at the beginner level when
we're thinking like cloud admin cloud
support
uh cloud analyst whatever it might be
whatever
role entry level role it is
it's more about understanding your
fundamentals in terms of like how do you
create a vpc or a v-net how do you
segment that into subnets how do you
secure it using acls network security
groups
how to make sure you have the right
traffic flow how to troubleshoot when
something isn't flowing the right way
things like that
when it comes to these networking
specific certifications you're going to
learn a lot more because they're
tailored to network engineers and yes
there is cloud networking which is a
specialty very lucrative very high in
demand and if you're interested in
networking already or already do
networking
highly highly recommend you sort of
bring your skills your networking skills
into cloud and you can potentially make
a lot of money and very in demand right
but as a beginner
that much
like expertise isn't necessary and i
know you know i hear people is telling
me all the time that studying for ccna
takes them months and months and i've
even heard years for some people they've
required years of experience plus
studying things like that right
and for a cloud beginner it's just not
necessary
keep in mind that a lot of these
services in cloud and this is for every
single platform
they're they aim to abstract security
the aim to abstract networking all these
things so you can simply focus on your
business logic and this is good of
course because you save time and when it
comes to the context of a company saving
time means saving money but when it
comes to troubleshooting or building
custom solutions understanding the
nitty-gritty of securing and networking
is going to help you
because not having that level of
abstraction
means you got to figure it out on your
own
but there are sort of more and more
services that come out all the time that
will abstract this for you and it kind
of makes it feel like oh do i really
need networking or secure or security in
the first place it's like well yes you
need an unders to understand the
fundamentals
because
there's going to be a day where it's
like why is this not working and if you
didn't know how to find the answer it'd
be a lot easier than you trying to
figure it out from like scratch right
uh i'm currently
upskilling myself and working i'm
following a lot of the az i think it's
the 700
or 500 i can't remember but they have uh
in azure a lot of the certifications
have learning paths it's like
pre-content on microsoft learn that you
can just learn about these things
i'll probably throw up a screenshot or
something like that uh i'm following you
that because i'm planning to do a
series with my good friend liam he's a
colleague
who actually has a network engineering
background and he's also a go developer
so if you're interested in those kinds
of things
he's also very skilled in devops and
cloud native
i'll make sure to link bam somewhere but
we're going to put together a nice
series for april
all around deploying a network
infrastructure into azure with bicep so
i have to upskill myself right but how i
had more of a networking foundation when
i came into cloud it would have been a
lot easier right
um but yeah that's my recommendation in
terms of networking certifications you
don't really need ccna network plus none
of these to get into cloud
but the sort of basic foundation of
networking that you will be exposed to
in every associate level certification
that you go out take for cloud will be
more than enough just make sure you
really really learn whatever it is that
they're asking you
i know when i when
i studied for something like even the
az900 like you have aspects of
networking in there something like the
az104 will also have that for you when i
studied for my aws certified developer
associate there was networking aspects
there too
so make sure you take the time to fully
fully understand
the networking aspects that are
introduced to you in when you're setting
for your cloud certifications but having
a network specific certification
isn't required isn't necessary
to be honest no certifications are
required but when you're getting started
they do help all right all right
that's it for this video feel free to
ask me more questions because i am
loving answering them and i will see you
in the next one
