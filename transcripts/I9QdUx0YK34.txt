miss herebut what up Adam Samuel how we doing
someone has this really long username
that starts with 4ps what up the rock
star
uh what else we got here
Frederico
what up Jammin what up yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeahI've been playing guitar a lot more so I
don't know if people know this but
before I got like really into
uh like getting my life together and
learning Tech I was I used to like play
play guitar and I kind of grew up
playing guitar
um like work with audio and stuff like
that
and when I started like learning you
know actually like working the help desk
gig and then
learning Tech and stuff like that I like
had to push all my hobbies and just
stuff that made me generally happy
um
away
but I've had I have this guitar so let's
poll 100 and then I have like a fender
tell acoustic back at my parents house
that I never brought to New York with me
but
last week I was like why am I wasting so
much time on like social media on
Twitter and stuff like that where I
could like easily grab those hours I
waste a day and kind of just put them
back into stuff that actually does me
well
so this that's what I did this week like
I grabbed all this time I was wasting on
social media and kind of just started
playing more playing more video games
playing more guitar I'm learning a new
song stuff like that
um
and man have I been significantly
happier like I don't know if y'all saw
me stream like two I think it was like
two weeks ago where I was like
I was like I felt like I was just done
with tech in general but I think it was
just a lack of uh
not do not doing things outside of it
researching on whether I want to switch
back to it from GIS mapping got my
degree in GIS and moved to it went back
to GIS now I want to get back into it
why do you want to get back into it
that's my first question not saying
there's anything wrong with the decision
I kind of just want to know why
I'm a non-tech guy at 34 guide me
towards a cloud Tech Guy please learn to
cloud.guide
Christian uh saludoshello love your videos real
informational thank you I appreciate the
appreciate you hanging outthe only thing about having this setup
like this is like this is like really
far from where I sit now so it's kind of
a painum let me seeI feel like I already answered that
anyway
drink some coffeeah yes the docker dramauh dockerso did you all see that Docker is
sunsetting the free team subscriptions
they I gotta find their uh their blog
though so we can look at this togetherblog and then they recently I don't know
hold on let's do this switch to
let me move this overokay let me pop this out one second pop
out the chat okay cool we can move this
overand then we'll switch to
okay we'll switch here we'll look at
this we'll look at this together my
friends okay cool
oh my goodness hold on I'm getting
I'm not even signed in I need to
turn remove this from here okay anyway
so Docker drama we apologize we did a
terrible job announcing the end of
docker free teams did anyone see thisanyone anyone see thisum where the heck did the chat go
oh wait I have too many things open
let me close this okay
hold on y'all I'm still getting used to
this new platform that I'm using to
stream
so we'll see this hereuh
uh
hey GPS good morning or good afternoon
uh it's 11 45 so it's about to be the
afternoon here
uh I'll catch up on the messages in a
second but yeah did anyone see this did
you all see this did y'all see this um
we apologize we did a terrible job
announcing the end of docker-free teams
um
for those of you catching up we recently
emailed accounts that our members of
free team organizations to let them know
that they will lose features unless they
moved to one of our supported free or
paid offerings this impacted less than
two percent of our users note that this
change does not affect DACA personal
Docker Pro Docker team or Docker
business accounts Docker sponsored open
source member soccer verify Publishers
or Docker official images
the docker free team subscription was
deprecated in part because it was poorly
targeted in particular it didn't serve
the open source audience as well as as
well as our recently updated Docker
sponsor open source program the latter
offering benefits that exceed those of
the deprecated free team plan obviously
they're going to say that I don't really
know I haven't looked into it but I saw
this I don't I can't remember how I
found out of this drama
uh we also like to clarify the public
images will only be removed from Docker
Hub if their maintainer decides to
delete them so anyway
initially the way I saw this like people
getting mad because now they've got a
switch or they got to start paying for
some stuff
uh how do you all feel
so I do I do agree that potentially the
way that they announce the the stuff was
like
okay you're kind of like missing some
context and like this follow-up
like does a great job of saying like oh
why we're actually doing it and why it's
like a great fitbut also
I feel like people like to get mad over
everything and this is also another good
reason why I'm happy I've like gotten
off Twitterbecause people love to have just
discussions on absolutely anything
uh yeah so
well open source images I rely on get
deleted not by Docker oh I like thatI like how I like how this is their
first line here not by Docker that's
like okay they learned from I guess
their mistake of not communicating well
the first time
what if I run an open source project I
saw someone share this like oh doctors
being hostile
uh because of this move that they made
so anyway Docker continues to offer a
specific Docker sponsored open source
program for open source projects and it
is not affected by Sun setting by the
sun setting of free team organizations
for new users
interested in owning adjoining dsos
that's a funny abbreviation from a
previous free team organization we will
defer any organization suspension
Revolution while the DDOS
dsos application is under review
this will give organizations at least 30
days before we suspend them if the
application is ultimately rejected
releasing
yeah I don't know it seems like they
have a path forward so
pretty interesting
um yeah but what do people think how
many of y'all use see also like I might
be it's like I don't maybe there's not a
point to talk about it because it says
less than two percent I feel like the
majority of y'all are probably using
like darker personal
or
um or like you have an account with like
the company that you workforcing my like
Docker Pro or something like that I feel
like in the open source space so this
was like making some news some headlinesum we should try to full face now
well I catch up on this chat what does
it say here
uhuh okay here
my last company overworked me before and
during the pandemic
I was working 70 hours per week and I
burnt out GIS wages are low and there
aren't too many jobs out there for that
so you want to get back into Thai tea
but so okay so the question is now is
like why did you switch from it to GIS
and then you switch back and then you
switch track again right like why did
you keep doing that because I feel like
if you make the switch again if you're
not resolving the re the issue that you
keep switching and then you just do a
switch again then you're probably gonna
end up switching again if you don't like
resolve like the actual issue that's
what I'm trying to trying to get atuh
did I miss the Twitter description oh
Tech Twitter Tech I don't know I I mean
I always have always ranted about tech
Twitter but I've never really done
anything about it I've always been like
okay this is I've accepted that this is
a part of my life and that I just have
to be a part of it but I don't know what
happened I think it was like last
Saturday I found myself like being
miserable actually I found myself being
miserable for the past couple of weeks
and
um you may or may not know but I'm a
very likesnip snap snipsis that that's is that a reference to
The Office episode that's freaking
amazing anyway back to the tech Twitter
thing so anyway I found myself sitting
down and being like miserable and like
as you know me I'm someone who journals
like I've journaled every single day for
the past
six seven years or so
so I kind of went back through like oh
my the past couple of entries for the
past couple weeks and kind of like
noticing this trend of like
I'm consistently comparing my career and
um just the progress I made and the
stuff that I'm doing and kind of working
in like the future for like next things
the next projects solely depending on
like
Twitter like what will do well on
Twitter like oh what will get the the
Twitter crowd on my side or like that
kind of stuff
so I was looking at back at that and
then I kind of like sat down and I'm
like I'm so freaking stupid it's so dumb
because if I look back like at my life
only five years ago
um
I would have I would have dreamed no I
dreamed and I prayed and I and I worked
toward having lives that I have now
having the salary that I have now having
the credentials the resume the
experience the peers the the support
from my family the the living situation
um an amazing partner like all these
things I just only could have dreamed of
before and now that I have it it's like
I'm to an extent find myself being more
miserable than I was back then right
um
so then I was like okay I gotta make
like some kind of change so I
essentially what I've done is like
decided to pretty much quit all social
media except for
sharing potentially any events or any
like resources or sometimes and I'll log
in maybe like once every couple of days
or something like that to see
um
if there's I don't know anything worth
like in my mentions that are worth
taking a look atum
and I I don't I don't want to log in at
all but I had to log in like I think
yesterday two days ago because I was is
I was waiting for someone to message me
back that's a hard thing too like having
communication through social media is
like the worst
um
but I was waiting on someone to to
message me back so finally they messaged
me back like I think it was yesterday so
that was kind of opened up so I won't
necessarily have to take a look at
anything but it should I guess it's
great so it's like obvious like everyone
knows like you know comparison is like
the absolute worst thing you can do
because you can't really compare
yourself to anyone because
you only live the life you only live the
life and you lose the life
that you have right
like if you go and compare yourself to
someone else and their life becomes
better whatever that's their life like
oh my goodness something's glitching
right I feel like I see something
glitching
I could be wrong though
um I'm slightly paranoid when it comes
to this video stuff because I want it to
be like pristine
um
but yeah
that's essentially why I'm I'm not like
deleting my profiles they're gonna be
there I'm just not going to use them and
I don't think it like and I think that's
gonna lead it to be lead my profiles to
become essentially useless
um so I don't like it won't gain any
followers and things like that which I
think in the context of advocacy should
be interesting but
the one thing I have to my favorite is
absolutely this YouTube channel so as
you know I've like still actively post
on here
I did two videos this week I have a
couple of other videos coming out
um and I definitely want to use all that
time that I get back on that peace of
mind and that mental ability that I
gained from not worrying about social
media to building like better content
better labs for y'all better projects
and that kind of stuff and just upskill
engine like in my engineering skill setum
so yeahthose are my thoughts thereif you are off Twitter where can you
find where can we find you other than
YouTube that's it YouTube
I don't want you to find me but you also
don't need to find me don't need you
don't need to keep up with me I'm not
doing anything important yeah like yeah
like use that time to I don't know spend
with your loved ones instead of worrying
about like what anyone else is doing
actually
um if I have anything important to share
that I feel is not going to steal your
attention that I feel is actually going
to be useful for you all a career I'm
gonna put it on my YouTube
um that's ithow to become so diligent like you to
write a journal every single day so I
have
man I have so many of these right now so
the third thing you need to do is grab
like any sort of notebook so I I use
these these are I don't know what
they're they're mole skins but they're
like the cheapest ones available
and what I pretty much do is I get the
completely blank ones because I wish not
because I wish because
I used to worry so much about like oh it
needs to be super fancy and my
penmanship needs to the best and all
that kind of stuff but then I realized
just having blank so essentially this is
just blank pages right there's nothing
on here you see that nothing on there
but what you but I find like the
absolute like best format that works
with me is like the first two couple of
pages you see that it's just my table of
contents like that's the date and that's
the page that I wrote it on so then when
I start a new
when I start a new like entry like I see
you seven I mean I obviously don't want
to show you all but like like that
like I have like longer ones I have one
day I have days where I'm like
completely
completely just venting so much but the
goal is like you write the date on the
top you write whatever you have to do
and then you put the page number on the
bottom and then at the pages in the
front that's you put the date like oh I
wrote about this day on this page and
then if you ever need to reference them
you just go back that you find the date
and you go perfect
ah someone's a Docker you mean podmanum
let me seebut yeah so
um so making it a very simple super
simple system but also just the the
power of momentum the power of of having
like a streak the power of like
um you're just doing something every
single day at some point is more than is
going to be enough to keep doing it uh I
use this app everyone knows this though
I'm like accent I'm obnoxious about it
but I have this this habit tracking app
right and it's to the point where it
might be silly but it works for me where
it's like I can just check off the task
like I just journaled before going live
so I can just hold this down
and then like that is so satisfying
and
like there's days where like I don't
like you see the X's there though so the
days that I missed for whatever reason
like last weekend I was at my parents
house so I didn't have anything well I
probably could have but I didn't want to
um
but yeah as you can see it's like just
having something to help you build
momentum I think is important for any
kind of habit you want to do
um so yeah
those are kind of my my tips there I got
you I share the same
feelings when we reach a moment position
in our life texture makes us feel like
the most people there are so much drama
about life seems affirmative yeah I feel
likeit was just helping me take for granted
so much that I have like so like
as cliche as as that as it sounds like
just being alive and being able to do
what I can do is what I should be
grateful for and what I should work
towards right
um I'm in a position for a reason and
like if if I weren't to do my absolute
best and if I were to like feel some
kind of way out through because of
things that are outside of my control
that's essentially doing a disservice to
to myself to my purpose to the people
that look up to me to the people that
love me that people support me so
there's no way to live y'all there's no
way to live
the docker immune pod man is hilarious
I know um
D Minor T minor Bard chord on that
guitar
I'm terrible at bar chords like so the
as you know with the guitar like
um you know I mean like you build like
the the the flexibility elasticity with
like your your your fingers individual
Fingers
um like the calluses all I lost all that
like I consistently played from like
when I was like essentially 10 to like
18 ish
and then
um
I stopped playing because I was like I
gotta get I gotta figure out what to do
with my life how do I make money how to
make a career or whatever and then a you
know those Hobbies kind of went to the
side
and now like there's still some muscle
memory there but I'm like freaking Rusty
like bar chords you know obviously doing
the
uh your index finger to create the bar
it's like
so difficult it's kind of frustrating
because like I used to be I used to be
able to do this so well and like but
anyway we'll get there we'll get therethat's necessarily at all it's actually
super Health useful yeah it's like
oh yeah and then all you gotta worry
about in the morning or not the morning
but the day is like just complete the
task that's it like you get it done and
then the next day okay you get it done
and then the next thing you get it done
and you kind of kind of keep building it
like that
quitting in social media like Twitter
for me will always make me feel like I'm
missing out a lot yeah I used to think
that too but guess what then like it's
only been like um
a couple of days and I'm like I missed
I've I've because of being part of
Twitter I've been missing out so muchyeah
do you do you feel obligated to post on
Twitter before yeah I kind of did I felt
like okay what's the next thing that I'm
gonna do to get likes what's the next
thing I'm gonna do to like get uh
engagement what's the next thing I'm
gonna do to go viral or whatever it is
so
if all that man F all that
do you get tired of the grind you got my
degree got certified I learned
infrastructure as code and Docker feels
like I'm selling these crouching surface
especially with tech influences raving
about everything and that's also why I
stoppedI
we like the glorify Tech
um
and like you'll see like these tick
tocks or these short form content uh
short film videos they're all like
oh like look at all these perks that I
get and then they don't really show the
work and so it's people will come in and
be like oh this is they get to live this
life so easy whatever but it's not
realistic
and they they fake the grind like anyone
can do a day in the life video
A Day in the Life video making it seem
like so perfect whatever but for one day
and then the rest of the day they go
back to what their actual life isbut I don't so I don't get tired I don't
get tired of working like my actual job
and like making videos like that that
part I don't I can't I could work like
12. I was I was just talking to my
girlfriend about this last night because
I was telling her about like how I was
feeling
and I told her like I don't get tired of
the work like that's not the part that
that is like the grind for me the graph
I wanna Grant isn't even a bad thing
like the exhausting part is all the
additional stuff around it like right
so that the actual social stuffs
well actually sitting down learning new
cloud services learning learning
anything or like even just building
something to teach or whatever it is I
love that and I I could I could do that
for the rest of my life until I decide
to retire
um but in order to make that sustainable
like
you gotta you gotta I gotta drop like
some other stuff right
uh is there any days where you feel like
not working at all when you feel like
you're not doing anything sometimes I
have consecutive days where I cannot get
things done how to balance your bad yeah
I've I've had been feeling so this is
exactly what brought me to this decision
it's like I hadn't been feeling that for
the past couple of months
um
maybe since like the mid-January late
January
and I can and I thought that
um
I thought that maybe it was time to make
a a change in career maybe I should go
to another company maybe I need to move
out of the city
um I was like
I was like
putting the blame or against the
responsibility on all of these external
events so somehow
one day when I sat down and I realized
okay what really is in my control what
can I change to make myself feel like
better
I made some changes and now like the end
of this week
I'm like wow this is this this is life
the way I want to live
um but also accepting that some days
you can do well and then some days you
cannot do well and then you always have
the opportunity to do well again the
next day
because if you feel bad about doing bad
then the next day you're gonna you're
gonna bring in that feeling of bad
and you're gonna have another bad day
and then that becomes like a vicious
circle so you're not allowing yourself
to
you're not giving yourself another
opportunity
what you're setting yourself up for
failure kind of thing and this is me
talking to myself because
we're all sort of trying to figure out
how to deal with this in a healthy wayum
yeah anyway
it always seems like a catch uh
out always seems like a catch-up gameI agree it's it seems like a catch-up
game if you're comparing yourself but if
you if you fully dedicate yourself to
only what you want to accomplish and you
don't look around like seek out seek out
mentorship in terms of like look into
look up
look out no not so we're looking to
or keep up to date I guess with people's
careers that you actually want
um but only use what they share as one
part to formulate what you want to do
and to formulate your opinion even
everything I say like let it only be one
part and then go hear what else someone
else has to say and then with that make
your decision
but once you dedicate yourself to kind
of just like 100 what you have to do
it doesn't seem like a catch-up game
because what do you have to catch up to
you don't have to catch up if you're
comparing yourself to someone else but
once you see it like it's just you then
it's more so like okay
awesome I'm getting this done then the
next I'm gonna do this but it's you
against you kind of thingif all that yeah somebody phrased like
this to me shiny internet numbers go up
and when I view it like that it just
seems silly yeah just internet numbers
that's literally all it is
um
yeah I even got I even found myself
having that issue with YouTube
and I had been like okay I probably
should quit YouTube but then I was like
no I feel like if I just stop caring
about metrics numbers I can still share
a lot of useful stuff on here so no I'm
not quitting
umwhat would you suggest if I want to
start learning cloud provided I have a
decent knowledge in web dev well you
probably have projects go deploy them to
different cloud services like deploy it
in a serverless
um
deployment model then deployed in like a
VM then deployed in a container and with
that you'll have plenty plenty of
projects to to get hands on with
looking to transition from help desk to
Cloud I've been coding python for about
a year got AWS systs off so a year ago
but I've never done it in a job what
else do I need I gotta go back over
everything
help desk the cloud okay so first of all
tell me about how much experience you
ever helped us tell me about the tasks
you accomplished there and then tell me
about the projects you're working on
like what kind of Hands-On skills you
got with Cloud I'm not talking about
like professional I'm just talking about
any Hands-On skills like what projects
have you done also what I tend to tell
people is like from that support level
to the cloud entry level like it's very
doable if you have like a year or two
but sometimes you might be able to make
the step to like assist admin to like a
network admin something like that where
you have you you still get to work on
with some stuff with Cloud but it's not
like a full Cloud job which I in my
opinion is
it's like it's like a ladder right you
take the next step and then the next
step and the next step and whatever
sometimes you can I don't know if you're
strong enough you can
go up uh two steps on the ladder rightum
but yeah like a lot of these the
sysadmin admin roles or like anything
that kind of gives you access to a lot
of helpless like support roles too a lot
access to something like active
directory at 365 like that's Cloud stuff
like you can take all that knowledge in
the Hanson's experience and leverage it
for your interviewing or for your
projects for your next position
um you just got to be open to it like a
lot of jobs out there will give you
exposure to Cloud without having cloud
in the title so keep that in mind too
I did nine Azure certifications last
year what why
I'm mentally exhausted and yet it feels
I have done nothing anything worth I
wonder if it would lead anything or
eventually would matter you don't nine
certifications so you clearly have a
discipline to study which is awesome
well I always tell people two
certifications is more than enough you
got to do certification project
certification project once you've got
two solid projects you got your two
certs you got a year of some kind of
technical experience I feel like you
have the whole pack and then you got a
good resume you got a good um LinkedIn
you got you have the whole package to go
and kind of apply to that first Cloud
role or that first thing that will give
you exposure to Cloud after like your
first support role right so
yeah
uhbut yeah like and again I feel like a
lot of this like going following
certifications constantly passing
passing passing sharing sharing is is is
a result of
a clout building or clout chasing on
things like LinkedIn on things like Tech
Twitter
um
because it's like oh like I passed this
everyone's gonna congratulate me and it
kind of gives you like a fake sense of
accomplishment
um
or like Instagram I wouldn't necessarily
say Instagram application but because it
takes you time to study of course but
it's like okay once all that dies down
what do you have at the end you have a
certification but like what did you
really learn what do you have to prove
to your employers or like your potential
employers or your potential clients or
whatever right
I passed Daisy 900 yesterday that's
awesome kind of threw myself in the fire
outside of looking for an entry-level
job do I start starting for 104.
so again like I mentioned that like kind
of like that that
like what you're trying to build so if
you have no technical experience you're
trying to get into Cloud
um I highly recommend doing support for
like a year
two certs two projects good LinkedIn
um profile
good resume practice interviewing skills
and then go into like the cloud search
um
the 104 depends I think the 104 is a
good one the 104 the 204 in terms of
like the Azure sphere are good um next
steps after 900. and
you could potentially look at a Prof
like what do they call it specialty or
professional after that if you wanted to
uh but 104 204 I personally like I
haven't taken the 104 the 204 but I
personally think the 204 seems a lot
more fun than the 104 but I think the
104 might be more applicable when it
comes to like Cloud admin Cloud support
which I tend to be more entry level
friendly what is the easiest role in
Cloud the easiest role in cloud is the
one that you're most prepared for
the main issue that majority of it have
it is they are missing the most
important piece math to do anything
Advanced requires math and it's a
different way of thinkingit is different way of thinking to
problem solve those
two are key
anything Advanced requires math what
kind of math are you talking about
thoughlike are you talking like college
calculus what kind of math are you
talking about I'm moving to Germany in
the next two months do you have an idea
what it is no no idea about Germany
no
no idea my friend apologies I want to
say apologies because you know I just
don't know anything about it also I
helped the server admin A.D nice those
that's gonna be great uh onboarding
off-boarding DNS IP reservations setting
up APS switch management VoIP Set uh all
admin lifted okay good good I think you
can take leverage that and go to network
admin sysadmin do a year and then you
got like
good experience then you move into like
Cloud admin Cloud networking something
like that can I land
an entry-level role with a college
degree and not much work experience just
an internship what about no experience
as possible to land a car a job with a
just a college degree to graduateI like to tell people that Landing a
role is only 50 in your control and that
50 is relies on like can you prove your
skill set you have a good resume do you
have like you know all the things that I
mentioned and 50 is just luck it's just
opportunity is the hiring manager in a
good mood are these people more open
more willing to take on new people that
type of that type of thing
umso so if that's like the the equation
then anyone can land a job with any kind
of
um a combination of those things in
reality because you have some people who
like just get offered
um
jobs like
because they're like they happen to be
at the right place at the right time
that's it
maybe they have like a family member who
owns like some sort of company or
something like that right
so don't think about it as like okay
what's the perfect formula to land a job
it's more so okay what is in your
control
then go and
get it done again I'm I still mention
like your best bet up for going into
like a lot of these entry-level Cloud
roles it's like you're looking at people
who are transitioning from other spaces
from tech people who might have um
career like degrees in cloud or degrees
and some sort of I.T related thing
um and if you got no experience you
might want to just consider like doing a
month in a month a year and some kind of
entry-level Tech role
get your shirts up get your projects up
get your resume done get your LinkedIn
done and then going applying right
because like it's like think of it like
a video game like I'm playing okay so
let's do it this way
I'm currently playing Zelda breath of
the wild okay I've beaten all the Divine
I know I've freed all the Divine beasts
and now I gotta go begin okay but
currently I'm very underpowered I don't
have the master sword I only have 12
Hearts I need to get one more heart to
go get the master sword
um like I know I know the game pretty
well right
but now what I gotta do is I gotta go
and and
um unlock some more shrines get some
more heart vessels
and probably do some side quests like
that kind of stuff and then build it up
so I have enough to go and beat the the
the boss like the final boss right it's
the same thing when you want to go and
apply for your role like you can go as
many times as you want but if you end up
continuously finding yourself being
rejected
it's because you got to go and you gotta
you gotta unlock some more shrines you
get it right so it's like it's like the
same thing right like it's it's like the
same the same
the same mentality is like you gotta
level yourself up against your because
there's going to be a lot of people out
there trying to go for these jobs tooum
hi suenza
yo just call me GPS all right uh
any virtual home lab environment racks I
looking into hybrid Cube currently for
IMA projects you know what's awesome
this not virtual
um I know Day Day cyber walks in YouTube
has a good home lab type thing I know
um Kev Tech he has Kev Tech I.T support
uh he has a good home lab type of thing
um
I was gonna say like what is this Tech
with Tim I think is his name he does a
lot of Home lab stuff it's like physical
stuff you're asking for virtualum
yeah I don't know too much I've I've
always just done stuff straight into
like kind of cloud
um but I guess I've had the privilege of
having some money to spend so I don't
have a degree in CS but I want to move
into Tech so should I do masses from
abroad or try to get a job in a company
located outside of India I know India so
okay so here's another thing
also like Twitter and social media will
tell you like you don't need a degree to
get into Tech that like they'll just
make those blank blank techno Tim yeah
that's it those blanket statements you
don't need to agree to get into Tech I'm
here to tell you that the answer really
is it depends right so for context I
used to live in Ecuador Ecuador's in
South America Ecuador is a very like in
order to be like a cashier at
um a grocery store you need to have a
degree like that's just it there's no
like you can't go on Tech Twitter and be
like this is BS like they don't care
like you need to go and get your degree
and then you can potentially have your
first entry level job right I know that
is the case for a lot of com of
countries and I know India shares sort
of that too where it's like everyone you
have to get a degree
or like I mean obviously there's those
fluke chances right
but you have to get a degree so that's a
reality like you kind of have to figure
out what you're working with where
you're at and what you're willing to put
up with and then put yourself through
that
I have the privilege of being a U.S
citizen and living in the US and being
in this generation of professionals
where it's like the the degree
requirement for tech jobs here is a lot
less rigid as it used to be right
so then for me it was like okay I guess
I could just work my way up
and figure it out there
that's it but also it's tough for me to
be like you don't need to agree because
it's your life what if what if you
really want a degree because you want to
make your parents proud of something
like that right there's so much Nuance
here
uhin India there's a bias in degrees Yeah
and if that's a bias you have to work
against then you're gonna have to do it
this I loved living in Ecuador but I
knew like that there was just a lot
working against me was like okay what
other opportunities I have and I could
since I was born in the US I could just
move back to the US so I didumlove the breath of the wild yeah oh my
goodness that game is so good I it's
just
I've missed playing video games for suredid the cloud resume challenge got
LinkedIn setup awss certifiedarchitect certified associate architect
circuit certified
solution architect associate oh my
goodness what's a good entry job for
someone with several years tier one
three uh it analyst for okay you're
looking at probably Cloud support
network admin Cloud admin
um pay attention more to the
descriptions than the real titles for
that next gig I think the one after that
is the one where you're like okay it's
time to figure out the niche it's time
to figure out the specialty whatever it
is but anything really that has cloud in
the description is probably something
that you're going to be doing really
well with uh just make sure you have
some good scripting skills I would say
something at least Powershell or Bash
I just got associate degree associate
degree in cloud computing does that
carry much weight to any possible yes it
does I feel like certs carry more weightyeah but if you already have an
Associated degree getting a cert is like
nothing like it'll take you like a
couple weeks to get and then you have
both
so I still haven't beat Ganon yeah I'm
like running around I'm trying to get a
lot of hearty dirt Darian no durian so I
can build those plates that give you
like 21 Hearts so I got them collecting
all those I'm running around trying to
find these ancient screws so and stuff
like that so I can upgrade my weapons
and then I tried beating him so this is
also okay so here's another thing
so I
tried to interview at places
umlike I want to say like every year
but whenever I feel like it's time to
kind of like test my skill set in terms
of like oh finding a new job or
something like that
putting yourself through like just
applying through like the interview
process and
kind of seeing where you're at kind of
measuring yourself I think is good too
because I think the the worst thing to
do earlier on your career just be like
oh I found this job that's it it's kind
of like what I'm gonna do for the rest
of my life
um if you're looking to like move up
right
um if you that's kind of like what you
want to do then that's completely fine
but in terms of like someone who's
looking to work their way up then I
could see that being like uh
like something that keeps you back right
so and I thought of this because
yesterday I I was like maybe I should go
try to fight Ganon and kind of see
how much more do I need
to to win so I got I got him down to
like 25 percentand
I was like okay I'm I'm close I'm this
close I just need to I need to upskill a
little bit more I need to build my
defenses a little bit more I need to get
better you know tools and whatever
but like putting yourself through
interview process especially when
especially earlier on like I was
applying to everything and even though I
was getting rejected
um
like it just just the the ability to
kind of measure yourself like like okay
I did well here I did bad here sometimes
people will provide you feedback
sometimes they won't which sucks I wish
everyone did
um but that's also like okay take any
anything that you get rejected from also
has an opportunity to learnhold on I I've I keep losing
now I want to go play breath of the Wild
uh I answered that one
uh uh finding a difficult to grow in the
UK lots of requirements for the smallest
of increments Gonna Keep at it though
this that's the mindsetthe rejection is always hard the more
you do it
the better you get at accepting itbut it never gets easyum if you're someone who dates a lot
like I earlier in when I was younger
it's not that I'm not young but when I
was younger uh I used to date like
significantly and like we get rejected a
lot
and I was talking about this to I think
it was like to my best friend the other
day I was like I feel like just becoming
comfortable with the dating scene and
the rejection really does help helped me
when I was going to get like
interviewing especially like
that transition from help desk to Sis
admin so I had so many rejections I had
people would call me I remember this
lady called me back just to bash my
resume like this how why would you do
this this looks terrible you're never
gonna get a job this this is this this
and I feel like if I hadn't been
somewhat comfortable with rejection that
would have just absolutely destroyed me
and I would have been like I don't want
to keep interviewing because I want to
put myself through that again
so yeah
put you got to put yourself through itbreath of the wild was good the last
boss gone into the pain because it plays
like a PowerPoint I'm justoh my goodness
does Microsoft interview difficulty
level depend on the year of experience I
don't know I've only interviewed here
well yeah I've only interviewed once so
I don't really have an insight into a
lot of people's interviews process I
should ask them that seems like um
this seems like a good good question to
ask some colleagues
uh
oh there's 59 people watching thanks
y'all we hit the we hit the I wanted to
hit 50 people so let's try it let's go
let's try to go for 100. how about that
let's be bold and let's try to hit 100.
AI seems daunting to learn suggestions
on where to start okay cool I have
thoughts on this
so back in the day I don't know how back
in the day but let's just say early1990s no no late 1990s early 2000s
AIML was strictly for the the the really
well
um
academics like academics the the people
who went to school and phds and Masters
and doctors and all this stuff rightand then came a little bit more progress
where okay other people could get
involved with it and then like that
evolution is to where it's now where the
way you interact with AI and ml is
through apis like you see stuff like
open AI Pi the stuff that Google's doing
all that kind of stuff right
so us as people who haven't dedicated
their life to understanding Ai and ml or
how to develop these models and stuff
like that are now in positions where we
can go and sign up for open AI API
there's I think there's like an 18 Grant
or 16 Grant now
uh for a couple of months so people go
get on that and you can learn how to
leverage that already existing
technology that has been abstracted for
us for the masses and you can go learn
how you can go read I shared this in the
video that I dropped yesterday it's like
you can go and read the research on how
these models work you can go and
understand all the documentation you can
go pick the library of the language that
you are most comfortable with I did like
three different three not different
projects but three projects using open
API
and we're now it's sort of like that
goes and enables you to kind of get your
hands
wet and like I guess more productive
with that type of Technology then if
you're like
um then like I think I did this in this
video before that like Association the
association pattern like if from there
you're like okay I I'm really really
interested in this I want to dive deeper
okay then take the next step into the
technology be like okay how do I learn
this more how do I actually fine tune
these models
um how do I actually like you know all
that kind of stuff and then if you go
into that and you're like okay I want to
learn more then it's like okay how do
you develop your own model from scratch
there's so much potential but starting
from like the highest level of
abstraction which all this this
technology is at now that's where you
start and that might be more than enough
to make you
um to get a job that's extremely
lucrative to make you to make your
skills get much more Niche which makes
you you know more hirable I guess not
more hireable but more desirable in
terms of your skill set
so yeah
lots of
lots of potential there go go become
comfortable with stuff like co-pilot uh
chat gbt uh not cheap gbt gpt4
um rgbt yeah gpt4
um that's like your first step rightuh and there's also like the
certifications out there like I think
the AI 200 is an interesting one that it
was just it was recently updated in
February
um I don't know the I know the other
companies probably have some too
so a lot lots and lots of potential
there
GPS how do you manage Microsoft job in
your personal blog YouTube and live what
is a match of organization
so I like I like the I like the
how do I say this
umthe
cohesion
so I like to feel like I'm working
towards a a single goal or a single
purpose or whatever word you want to use
to define it right
and I'm lucky to be now in a position
where my stuff that I do for the company
that I work for and the stuff that I do
outside they have a lot to do with each
other
my goal at work is to build a nurture
Community around Microsoft Technologies
okay my goal on YouTube is to help
people land jobs in Cloud a lot of times
the stuff that I do in one I can
abstract parts of it and then it comes
back into YouTube so I'm not doing two
things like I'm not doing twice work
like maybe it's just like a 0.5 more
whatever something like that right
so if I go and build a workshop or a
demo or something like that I can grab a
part of that put it on YouTube and it
helps everyone too so that way you know
it's like I'm being more efficient with
my time but also I feel like that also
push pushes my career further uh in a
way where it's like okay I'm doing
something at work then I find so I grab
it and then I tune it to the stuff that
I do outside and then that and then from
there it Sparks something else that I
want to do from work and like it's it's
a it's a very lovely system that I've
got going onum
so yeah that's kind of like the the I
want to methodology Maybe
but I also used a very simple system to
organize my time I have like one app
like to do app and it's like the most
basic to do app out there it's like it's
Microsoft to do where it's like you have
a list but I barely use the lists I just
have one like okay these are things I
need to do and then I go on to my
calendar the beginning of the day I have
I have a
um let me show you
you see that on the bottom I guess that
would be your bottom left schedule day I
go in the beginning of the day I
schedule my day I'm like at this time
I'm going to do this I look at my
meetings and stuff like that and then I
whenever it whatever the time says that
that's what I gotta do I do when I do it
that's it so for today I'm streaming
until one and then I gotta go back to
work from one to five and then I have
more time in the afternoon or after that
uh that I could potentially
be used to continue doing YouTube stuff
or
free time
all rightwhat's the next steps for you after
Cloud architect what is the most remote
job within cloud and finally can you
tell me is
some is jobs and how they differ from
I.T jobs what is isso
after Cloud architect what do you mean
after Cloud Arctic okay so the I guess
the Muslim the the most like resident
the the part that resonates the most for
me from this question is
the remote remote is not an aspect of
the field that you are in or yeah like
whatever career you choose remote is
more so something that is put in place
Company by company you can have two
companies that do the exact same thing
one could be fully remote and the other
one could be fully in person okay so it
has nothing to do with the skill set
that you have also within that company
one can be fully remote one can be fully
in person and one of them might be open
to making more exceptions than the other
one the exceptions like okay you can
have remote three days you can be higher
whatever that depends on I guess the
culture or whatever they have in place
at your company or the place that you
know is in putting into place these
practices
um
so I would say
yes Tech in general is more robot
friendly than other roles but don't
think that every single role in Tech
will be remote just because it is like
just because all like all I can do cloud
from my house why would I ever go on
site it's like well if there's a job
that's paying you and it's like the only
opportunity you have and it's on site
you're probably gonna take it right so
keep that in mind rightI'm tracking rejections I'm at 35 road
to 100. and I'm only counting actual
interviews not the auto rejects man
those ah
I one of the most heartbreaking
interview experiences I had as a company
I really really wanted to work for
and it was this was I was still my cloud
engineer gig so this was before leaving
to join a cloud Guru
um
no no no no no no hold on this was I was
at my sis admin job before my promotion
to Cloud engineer
and I remember I got the the whole
interview process was a mess it was like
two months I got to the very end
and for some reason it was just taking
forever for them to either reject me or
to give me an offer and then I pulled
out at the very very like last
minute because then I ended up getting a
promotion which was awesome
but there's nothing I mean in terms of
like that whole interview process or
that world of interviewing there's
nothing harder than really wanting
something really envisioning yourself in
the elk I got this job in the bag so
this is why I give the advice to like
don't ever Envision yourself in a job
unless you actually have an offer
I don't know why this comment made me
think of that but yeah
we got this we do got this what up
Michael Scott nice wall Banner pick the
office has saved me
from many many manyit essentially got me out of like a very
depressive state that I was in years ago
so that's why I kind of keep it present
like I see it every day I have this
other like uh fan art thing over there
that has this is like a collage there's
like a bunch of different office scenes
in one one artwork it's freaking cool I
love it but having these small reminders
that oh there's many things to just
simply enjoy in life
I think it's a good idea
does terraform fall under any actual
cert it's Cloud agnostic yes correctuh everyone going to be jumping on AI
seems like a wasted opportunity to not
scale up your skills in AI
thanks for the answers I'm always
struggling with the right roadmap to
keep in Focus so like again in the video
I showed yesterday you have the people
who are like AI will never do anything
no need to pay attention and you have
any other The Other Extreme AI is going
to
um
completely replace everyone there's no
hope for everyone like we're all going
to be obsolete et cetera et cetera et
cetera and then you have all the space
in between right so I feel like the
people over here who are like hey guys
never gonna do anything are definitely
in trouble but the people over here who
are like oh there's no hope for everyone
are also going to be in trouble because
ultimately you end up missing the real
opportunity the real media opportunity
right so the analogy that I like to use
here is like it didn't go from horses
for transportation to self-driving cars
and went from horses
to Cars and Cars have had many many
iterations right
to now just now self-driving cars rightum just barely becoming a technology
that is being acceptable and at the
state where it can be used right so I
feel like if you're on either extreme
you're missing that immediate
opportunity I was like well what is the
actual car what is the car opportunity
here right
yesterday there was a presentation the
Microsoft did with uh introducing
essentially this type of technology in
the entire 365 Suite I highly recommend
you check it out
really really cool and you can
immediately see how much more productive
people are going to become because of
this type of stuff
but if you are closed off to it
then that's the only way are you if
you're closed off to it or you're scared
of it that's the only way to guarantee
that you're gonna be in trouble
but if you go open-minded and you're
like okay I can go learn this stuff
let me see how I can leverage it you're
gonna be goodif not we all just you know we'll move
out to Farms we'll raise our own cattle
like we'll be all right we'll figure
something out text overrateduh
the YouTube channel is cloud agnosticcan you share your experience of working
at Ms and also share how you and your
colleagues dealt with layoffs okayI'll preface this by saying I really
like working on Microsoft uh it's been
my dream company I have my dream role
but I would be doing myself a disservice
by not being completely honest
um
I I'm also someone who's I've shared
this publicly like my mentality for work
is I've never considered work to be my
family I know at the end of the day it's
business but it's business both sides
like it has to be beneficial for me in
terms of like are you paying me what I'm
worth am I being challenged in our
business from for the company side where
it's like are you getting what you
expect out of like in in someone who
works like an employee rightlayoffs are difficult
um
for many many aspects I think like the
most obvious one is is just like
obviously people are gonna lose people
have lost and are gonna lose and I
include myself in that because I'm not
just because like I have a presence
online or something like that doesn't
make me immune from anything really like
I feel like I'm gonna get laid off every
single day but to be fair I feel like
that even if the economy is in the
absolute best position right
so obviously the first part is like
layoffs are difficult because these
people livelihood including myself
so anyway
that's why I've always stressed the part
of like being financially responsible
and financially educated like I I have a
video I did this a couple of weeks ago
on the resources that I used to really
just understand money how to become
better
um like how much do I really need to
save uh understanding 401ks
understanding Roth IRAs understanding
investing understanding okay how much
money do I need available for myself in
that for the next three months for the
next five years is stuff that I don't
need available the next five years what
do I do with it stuff like that right
that is very important and that has
enabled me to be like okay even though
if I if I do get laid off I'm gonna be
okay because I like put in the work to
figure this out but Financial education
is is so lacking from
School in generalum
so there's the financial aspect of it
that's really difficult
um but also the the part where we have
even less resources than
the the financial aspect is like the
emotional aspect the toll that it takes
on someone to be laid off and also to
people who have
like people that they work with to be
laid off just one day like one day like
the next day this person is just not
there I think that's crazy because we do
spend a significa this significant
amount of time working
um
so it's tough for me there's been
definitely moments of like a lot of
anxiety a lot of sadness
um
and you know I wish no one ever had to
get laid off but that would be not
realistic in doing myself a disservice
because that if I had that mentality
then I wouldn't go and prepare myself in
as many ways as I could
so yeah I mean that's kind of my
response I'm not blaming anyone for
making the moves that they they make I'm
sure they have really smart people
behind those types of decisions
but
yeah it sucks that's kind of like the
only feelings I have about it
uh what up everyone
saying hi what app is that anyone what
app are you talking about the The
Habit tracker I use is called streaks
I didn't know you lived at Venezuela and
moved to us no I'm I'm Ecuadorian okay
I'm born and raised in the U.S and then
when I was 10 my my parents
moved my brother and I my brother's a
year older than me to Ecuador and we
lived in Ecuador for 10 to 11 years and
then I moved back so I was born here
originally
um but I speak fluent Spanish espanolis
so I don't know but I've always had this
like
never really feeling like I feel half
here half an Ecuador kind of thing is
it's an interesting feeling
um
but yeah
uh hello have you ever found yourself
starting to study for a specific topic
and then find yourself going down a
rabbit hole of researching other topics
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
so naturally I think sticking to citric
wait no no hold on I'm working as an
admin supporting Citrix environments so
naturally I think sticking with Citrix
to be honest but I feel like security
was more enjoyable okay so here's my and
I shared this I've done so many videos
about different things that I feel like
would be great advice for people in
general But ultimately things that I've
done for myself
so I have this system of sort of
aligning or just finding things that I
want to learn and the only thing you
have to really do is say okay for the
next two weeks this is just what I'm
doing for the next three months is what
I'm doing like figure out that time
frame so for me it tends to be every
month
January February into March it was
heavily bashed it was heavily Linux open
source type of soft and towards like the
middle when they like open AI stuff
really became like news thing I felt
really lacking like oh I need to hop on
this but I always I always sort of like
trust the systems that I've put into
place it's like no I know that I need to
see this through and then once it's done
I can reevaluate so now March is
essentially like I've got everything
planned out so going into April is my
next position like okay what am I doing
um how do I learn like how do I bring
something new learn how do I work on
something new whatever it is but you you
kind of have to set yourself up with a
goal or but you're like okay I'm gonna
do this until then and just stick with
it just see it through because if you
don't you constantly switch then you're
never going to get anywhere
so keep that in mind
in terms of like figuring out what you
actually want to learn it is a balance
between becoming better at your current
job and then upskilling for what you
want to do later on
um
and you kind of just have to find a
balance there like no one will be able
to figure what that business decision is
than yourself because you are the one
who is going to have to live with the
salary that you make live with the work
that you got to do day to day uh live
with like putting yourself through
interviews right
um I have found that usually around like
for myself like a year year and a half
into a role I'm just consistently doing
the role consistently upskilling for the
role and then that's typically around
the time where I'll evaluate okay do I
need to learn something else to go to
the next role or do I want to double
down on what I'm doing now that's just
what works for me but for you would be
different
I'm in my second year in uni I'm
studying networking and information
security I'm really interested in cloud
computing what can I do to get into it
and does my major prepare me for itum
so cloud computing is is you have
networking you have
um
command line experience so bash a
programming language a cloud platform
and some devops fundamentals so grab
that and kind of figure out what you're
lacking and then in terms of the skill
set once you fill those like feel what
you're lacking you have everything you
need in terms of does your major prepare
you for it I don't know I don't know
what your curriculum looks like uh but
that's kind of what you need to know
that's like the pillars the foundation
to to learn cloud computing
uh hello GPS I'm Kenya and I watch the
videos a lot your inspiration thank you
I hope you have a fantastic dayI think skill trades are insulated from
layoffs you can always make money with a
trade oh my goodness
apprentices don't make much but it'll
pay a few bills so this is literally I
don't know I feel like this chat has
been just amazing because you keep
bringing up stuff that I've been just so
like thinking about lately
so my girlfriend has a business in HVAC
so she runs a business she gets like
contracts she has you know that kind of
stuff right
does HVAC stuff right
and we were literally talking yesterday
because I've been interested in in
investing in helping grow the business
because I just see like and my dad does
HVAC too and he's done HVAC for like 30
years so I have like a lot of insight
into what it looks like to work in that
space
and the one thing that I have seen that
has just been consistent through my
entire time of like my dad working there
is that there is always jobs available
and he says now like they can't they
can't
they can't find people to work and like
these these trades you make significant
amount of money like I think he's easily
making 70 80 an hour and if you went
independent he could make significantly
more but he like needs benefits and
whatever stuff like thatand
I think if you're someone who doesn't
really know what you're interested in
going into a trade talk about job
security
like look at us all in Tech like yeah we
were uh like a couple years ago we were
like oh this is the best look at how
much money we're making but now
ultimately our our destiny is up to the
companies that we work for right
um
but a trade at the end of the day
everyone needs an electrician everyone
needs a a plumber everyone needs a
um someone to do their HVAC all these
type of things
so if you have any interest in that type
of stuff I would say go for it
100 go for it do it or even just do it
on the side like if you get weekend gigs
you racking up money thoughdo you go back to visit often I used to
go like every year and then pandemic
obviously I want to go back in May
they're doing like um
conference that I really wanted to do a
talk at so we'll see what happens
gotta start being productive now as
always thank you for you guys GPS your
content here is better in a lot of
people's lives so big thank you have a
great day so Lopez
um
appreciate you hanging out have a great
have a great one get get all the work
done I'm gonna hang out for like 10 more
minutes because I gotta again I told
y'all I do schedule stuff so at one
o'clock I gotta go back to to billing
out something at work so yeahthank you
[Laughter]
you mentioned Financial knowledge
lacking a school system where do you
think would be a good place to start
learning about financing the global
scene
uh USA and Europe so first of all get
your your knowledge about your own
Financial system in place like as in
like you're you're not just like not
where you're like you're based but your
own money as you start to learn how your
own money works you start to realize how
like at a global scale this could
potentially work
um because maybe investing looks
different in the US and like in Europe
and like in a bunch of different places
but the concepts of investing
are pretty Universalso once you can sort of learn to do that
and like I'm not telling you to go put a
thousand dollars in the stock market
like you can just read on like four in
the US 401K is real high array stuff
like that
um and then you'll learn essentially
like the fundamentals of what investing
actually is uh I'm not telling you to go
day trade or anything like that right so
once you have your own Financial system
like you're good
like you know what your money is you've
got some sort of automation or whatever
whatever your system works like
then from that you're going to have like
again it's Association pattern with that
it's like okay I have sort of like this
Minds this these I've learned these
things about like this how does this
work anywhere else
and then I'm sure you can you can find
books and stuff like that that will
teach you
more about that in other places
but the first step is like starting with
what you can you can immediately you can
immediately work with I think
um do you think you'll ever do a cloud
resume challenge over on your own
platform what do you meanwhat is that what does that mean
just finished CCNA looking forward
either at az104 AI 900 for my next
topics I understand they're different
but curious which one would have better
return on investmentuh you got 104 what's your goal
I mean to be honest the AI 900 if you
have some kind of cloud experience you
if you have some kind of azure
experience you could probably knock that
out in like two weeks so in the grand
scheme of things if it just takes you
two weeks to like get it done and
upscale and that type of stuff it's also
like from what I've seen it looks like a
pretty fun and easy one to get Hands-On
with so you spend the news two the next
two to three weeks learning a lot you're
not really like losing a lot of time
um
and then you jumped into like a 104 204
after that
that's very doableexplain wealth stuff thanks
thank youyou were back and helped us days if you
were back in your help desk days would
you worry about your technical skill
being outsourced I am in delivery
Consulting and feel that they want us to
be native speaking PMs and not technical
what
do you do you worry about being
your technical skill being outsourcedI think this could apply to probably all
roles being outsourced obviously the
higher your seniority the harder it
probably is to Outsource Your Role but
that's also why you kind of have to have
like an upskill system like I mentioned
I have a video on this it was like my
first video this year where it was like
habits for a successful career in Tech
something like that
where I talk about plan out your
upskilling for a couple months or like
whatever the time frame works for you
and then
that's I guess that's the one thing
about tech is like something like the
the work like balance is essentially
Terrible by default
because you're constantly at the risk of
being replaced by either someone else
who can do it cheaper or someone else
who can do more for the same amount of
money or AI
so
I agree with the the sentiment of
worrying but just know you're not alone
in worrying and if that brings you any
consolation then you know hopefully it
does AI 900 is great nice and
comprehensive I want I want to take
I want to take it and I want to do a
study group with y'all what do you thinkI've been talking too much okay
last few questions get it in because I
gotta
I gotta bouncebut this this stream was nice it was
nice to hang out with y'allum
my bad I was asking if you would do
the cloud resume channel on your Channel
versus ACG
the thing about the cloud resume
challenge video is it's so long there's
a lot to do and I felt like that video
even though it's maybe a little outdated
it has like the majority of what you
need to do
and
um it would take me a significant amount
of time to do it for for myself uh and I
don't really have a lot of current
things I'm prioritizing that align well
with a video like that
um if at any point I do then I would do
it but just now it's just not really
something that I can put time intostudy would be great that would be great
if I've done the 204s that were doing
any of the fundamentals I don't think so
maybe the ones that you have no
experience with like so I don't think
the AZ 900 would be worth it but maybe
something like the AI 900 the sc100 900
the the dp900 like any of the other like
niches that you're not knowledgeable
with I think it might be worth it but
doing like 204 and then going back to do
the easy probably not the AZ 900. thank
you for your help really helps me a lot
thank you for the five dollars I'm gonna
go buy a coffee with that later on or
maybe
maybe like a bacon egg or cheese or
something or
maybe something else or maybe like a
maybe like a fruit juice I've been
really into like green juice lately
all right let's see
hello GPS if an employee has some years
experience in some Fields say data
engineering and wanted to switch to
another field say cloud engineering
devops will the experience years get
considered yes but it is up to you
to put it in your resume and to shape it
to be relevant to your next role
okay so keep that in mind again every
time you go and you you submit your
resume somewhere you gotta tailor it
so don't just put like blanket send your
resume out to every single role the same
way as it is
it's up to you to grab the experience
that you have and height how can I how
can I use this for my next role not only
just for your resume because also when
you're in the actual interview process
and
you know people are asking you questions
and they'd be like why is this like um
why like why should we hire you why is
your experience relevant it's up to you
to put in the work to figure out why
it's relevant
all right all right y'all that is it
um I see people are interested in the
study group I'm gonna keep that in mind
I do have the opportunity to do
something like this
part of like being part of Microsoft so
um
I care about you all wanting to upskill
so all I want to see how I can help you
with that
um so yeah[Laughter]
all right peace out everyone I will see
you I don't know when should when should
I do the next stream before I leave
foreign
I constantly fight with myself as to how
often I should do these streams I don't
want to do it every day because I feel
like that would be too much for y'all
and too much for me but I know having
some sort of consistency is cool because
you all know you can tune in oh every
Friday or every kind of day and if you
have any questions you can ask or if I
have anything to share I can do it
outside of a video
because I do like the live stream format
especially like these
um
these types
of streams where I can just talk about
anything
technical streams are like
but these kind of streams are like a lot
of fun
what does Microsoft give Christmas gifts
Tech Hardware no
I don't think I got a Christmas gift
uh
what up day
Friday Fridaynights are tough because I'm trying to
be more social and going out like I'm
going go-karting today it's gonna be fun
um once a week once I think once a week
might be the key might be the key once a
week but like Monday through Friday
which says the best I used to do on
Thursday nights those things were lit
however this one was pretty good too
um
Thursday night might be a good one too I
might try try I might try it next week
Thursday night
not too little not too much gfx all
right we'll see maybe I'll do a poll or
something like that all right thank you
all so much for hanging out I see y'all
next week sometime hit the notification
Bell
uh peace out
