someone asked a fantastic question that
I want to address about company loyalty
if you were to if Microsoft were to lay
you off obviously with Severance but
then want to rehire you in say six
months would you go back let's tackle
this one by one because there's another
question in there too
short and sweet yes if the role was
beneficial for me if it was a situation
where I was like yeah this is what I
want to do next with my career then yeah
why not I don't think there's any point
in holding grudges because you can get
laid off or whatever happens you hold a
grudge and you know for years and years
you kind of are dealing with those
emotions and the day after this company
lays you off they're not going to be
thinking about you so it really only
makes an impact on you to hold a grudge
that doesn't really make a lot of sense
to me
obviously would be different if the
whole if I was treated unfairly if I
feel like was a lack of respect if I
feel like that's the whole way that the
layoff was handled was
I don't know made me feel less than a
human
that would make a a difference
absolutely but if it was just sort of
like hey you're being laid off here are
the reasons here's what we're offering
you Severance and all these kinds of
things I'm not all right cool at the end
of the day working for someone working
at a place is a business transaction on
both ends because you are providing a
service and being paid for it a company
is paying for your service right and
obtaining the the results or the work
that you're doing and and also it's a
relationship and just like any kind of
relationships uh like with a partner
with a friend with a family with
colleague it needs to be beneficial and
respectful and fair to be a healthy kind
of relationship
there are obviously unfair relationships
abusive relationships unhealthy
relationships but no one wants to be in
those
obviously people get stuck in those or
get involved in those for a billion
reasons but we're not going to talk
about that in this video
so at some point if you feel like this
relationship is no longer productive for
you then you're going to want to get out
of it you're going to go to another job
or if at some point your employer feels
like that for whatever reason then they
can move as well it's business on both
ends it has to be beneficial for you to
want to be there and that would include
being at a place that you feel
challenged that you feel like you're
doing work that you enjoy do you feel
like you're respected that you feel like
you are paid fairly all those kinds of
things are very important right
and this leads to
the the other part of this question here
that says do you love the culture at
Microsoft or any company enough to trust
them again company loyalty worsen versus
modern corporate model of protect
profits and shareholders interests at
all costs
I don't think trust and loyalty should
ever be something that you
have to worry about in a business
relationship or in a work relationship
because when you are hired somewhere
there are contracts there are laws that
the employer has to follow
and
they cannot break or else they're
breaking the law and they can get in a
lot of trouble you don't have to trust
them
they are just going to have to act the
way that they're signing off that
they're going to have to act on because
there could be illegal issues there
loyalty is also another thing that I
never really understood or this concept
of like well a work family or like we're
all like a one big happy family or like
you know we're like that is just it's
just silly I feel like that was always
used to kind of hold people
back or feel like they deserve or they
have to put up with something because of
whatever reason
and your family and your life outside of
work is very separate from
your colleagues and the relationships
that you have at work
sure you can make great friends and
probably friends that will outlive your
time at a company
but that's different right
so I don't really think loyalty plays a
a big part or any should play any part
in in work right you are signing a
contract saying that you're gonna go do
this kind of work you're you have
expectations you'll have performance
reviews and things like that so like
you don't need to have the concept of
like loyalty there when there's
paperwork in place to to handle all that
so I don't worry about that at all
you also don't need to have the concept
of trust or work to do your absolute
best work I think that comes from
you know within that's like oh I just
want to do the best at what I do because
that's what I require of myself
for some people that might be a
different type of relationship and
that's completely fine
I don't really need to be somewhere
where I feel like I'm being treated
fairly to do the absolute best work what
I will say is that I most likely won't
last at that place for too much time if
I don't feel like it's a healthy
business relationship
uh and earlier on in your career you'll
probably go through a lot more of that
those than later on and oftentimes
people find themselves having to put up
with those for a bunch of reasons maybe
they absolutely have to put up with work
where they feel like they're not being
treated fairly they're not being paid
fairly because they have families to
take care of and they need the income or
they don't really know how to get out of
it what's the next move for them a bunch
of other things which is also why I
think having something like Financial
education and and
um being smart with money in general it
will enable you to be able to make more
sort of level-headed
decisions in your career so you don't
end up having to stay in these like
terrible
uh
roles that you don't want to do or jobs
that you want to do
also could add that I'm sure there's a
bunch of employers out there that take
advantage of the fact that they know
that someone can't leave or like they're
in a
bad situation or something like that
which sucks and I hope that these people
find resources in ways that they can
make better moves
for themselves
and I also understand that maybe the
world is set up in a way where it's like
oh there's no Financial education in
high school and then we're sort of
pushed to go to college and make like a
lot in debt and then you get out of
college and you already have this
massive debt so you go and you take on
any kind of job I understand that as
well
um
I think maybe there's a little bit of a
shift happening now where like all the
free knowledge is available on YouTube
and all that kind of stuff makes
um us like it you can see that there are
other options which I think is cool
yeah I think I'm rambling now but anyway
long long video don't watch I would
return to an employer that's laid me off
if they wanted to rehire me and it was a
beneficial move for me there's no point
in holding grudges because that employer
most likely forgets about you a couple
days after and you're going to have
these negative feelings with you for
until you decide to let them go there's
no point of that trust and loyalty
aren't really things that come into play
when it comes to a work or business
relationship save that for your non-work
like save that for your friends for your
family and all that kind of stuff
all right that's it for this video
