that like stop okay you did send me I
thought you did stock up
I did not I was like
the chemistries yeah it's very
appropriatevery appropriate for the week
um the University of industry is an
American video game developer located in
redern Washington part of Xbox game
studios
crazy
so there was
uh what's the number for gcp 12 000 laid
off today yeah 12 000 laid off at gcp
twelve thousand light off at a Amazon
not just AWS Amazon
and then obviously the 10 000 not sure
yeah I think ten thousand
uh Microsoft but
I
don't know if everyone's been
like told or I don't know really but
that's like remember that they're
they mentioned
um
what a week it's like personally it's
like
every time Outlook makes a sound
it's very
it's very use a lot of anxiety anxietyso there's thatuh I just discovered this discover that
I have to rebuild my entire VMware lab
setup including a new domain controllerum
is this like a work thing yeah I'm
assuming this is working yeah and like
what happened I'd love to know some
backstory here
because I build an entire VMware it says
VMware lab so that's why I feel like is
this a personal setup kind of thing
could be
what up HC how you doing Lucas oh
there's two Lucas's in there there's one
Lucas Henderson and one
just Lucas
Eric how you doing Alex how you doing
Lucas asks what is the reason for these
layoffs pleaseuh probably I don't know they say like
you know economy and all that kind of
stuff so that's
really all I know
Alex this year they were looking for an
excuse to play copycat huhyeah
I think they all have been saying that
you know we
have been hiring so
much over the last
five ten years
um and that was not sustainable
and they're realizing it now with the
economy collapsing so that's the same
kind of sentiment I've been hearing
around from like leadership and stuff
I got a fantastic question let me bring
it up
hold on I got this really good question
I was like I want to answer this on
stream I don't I didn't even really
think about it I said I want to think
about an answer on stream
okay
okay it says here
uh wait hold on where is it uhuh okay uh
if Microsoft were to lay you off
obviously with Severance but then want
to rehire you in say six months would
you go back regardless of the job you
did or did not acquire in the interim do
you love the culture at Microsoft or any
company enough to trust them again
company loyalty versus modern corporate
model are protect profits and sharehold
interests at all costs no I don't think
it's a right answer but I'm curious
so the question is
would I return to Microsoft if I was
offered a job after being
after being laid off so Saget laid off
then six months later like hey we want
you back would you come back
and then there's other kind of questions
about uh company loyalty and stuff like
that
um so let's break that down that first
answer is I guess it depends on what I
was doing the
the next like my natural
I think I'm in a position where I I
would would most likely
take a lot more to decide on what my
next role would be so if I do join
another place I wouldn't probably be
looking to leave right away
um because you know you know I think it
probably takes a couple months to land a
role in this again actually I don't
really know but you know six months is
relatively short
to like leave a place especially if it's
one that I've made like a very Mindful
and aware decision to join nowthat means that doesn't mean like I
wouldn't go away go I was just thinking
like most likely that's the situation
that I might find myself in so probably
not but that doesn't have anything to do
with that like I'm upset at Microsoft or
anything like that no absolutely not
it's just probably I'm at a job that I
I enjoy or something like that uh
what about you what if you were laid off
would you go back
I was going to ask you like a follow-up
question what if they reach out to you
in a yearagain it depends on like what the role
is what I'm currently doing I think this
person is more so trying to ask me like
if I'm going to hold some kind of grudge
against the any company that lays me off
and
if it's done in a respectful way in a
way that like they did their best they
absolutely could to handle it then yeah
so be it
um
yeah I don't think I would hold any
grudges unless it was done in a way that
like humiliated it me or made me uh made
my my job search for like after that
more difficult than maybe but
I don't think so they
the second part to that is like company
loyalty
I don't necessarily think I have loyalty
to
any company or or brand or anything like
that
um I know I like YouTube and a lot of
stuff that I do is like there's a lot of
azure and stuff like that but that's
mainly because that's what I was working
with before I worked at Microsoft and
that's obviously what I work with now if
I left and was at a shop that like I got
reached out for like an AWS developer
role the other day and I'm not
necessarily opposed to it but
yeah I don't really think that I'm tied
to certain technology I like I truly do
like Azure I truly do enjoy working with
Microsoft products but if another
opportunity came along and uh then you
know you'd probably see more of that
stuff in my channel I think I would want
to stick to Cloud but the loyalty to a
company isn't necessarily
like massive that doesn't mean that I
mean I guess the other the flip side of
that is like I really enjoy the role
that I do I enjoy the team I enjoy the
work
um I enjoy the culture and that
um so I would like to see here but if it
doesn't happen then you know you're
gonna you gotta move forward you gotta
find whatever the next the next thing is
hold on my
girlfriend close the door and then the
cat is in here
the cat wants to get outum let's see
how how do you feel what do you think
about company loyalty
yeah I know
um I think it's pretty much same
sentiment that you know it's the tools
like I use both AWS and Azure I
use twilio to build the stuff the
content the talks I still use Python
right
and if it if there is a rule that aligns
with all of thatafter twilio so saying that if I get
laid off and I go work somewhere else
where maybe I have to learn gcp which
was the case a few months ago right or
like last year
um yeah I don't believe that
I would leave a company within six seven
months where I was on boarded and
also being the role that I needed
desperately or not desperately but you
know when I was laid off like I don't
think I would leave that role within the
short amount of time to go and like
bounce back to
uh tulior
Microsoft in your caseone thing I will guarantee you is that
and I was talking to Richard before so
this is why it's relevant it's if I did
get laid off
I would make
videos up until I found my next thing
because I'm looking for a job without
having a job is something that I haven't
experienced
for a couple of years
so now that I have way more years of
experience and a way different mindset
that I did when it originally happened
to me I'd be curious to see how I would
handle that so my channel might turn
into like unemployment Vlogs for a
little bit until I find whatever the
next thing thing is so
yeah but ultimately business is business
uh layoffs are going to happen and it
sucks it really does but it really does
make a difference how companies handle
it and I think that is what matters more
for me in making a decision if I wanted
to like come back or not
umumgave up on company loyalty years ago
perhaps my company just made me jaded
though there are companies that
definitely suck that's for sure one
thousand percent
yeah I wouldn't know ever go back to a
company that laid me off
uh
uh malix's just Malik's is just like
dubia said how they do says more about
the company than the staff restructuring
by itself
yeah I had two companies call me back
after they quarterly feelings I said no
thankseven if they offered more compensation
as form of apology
I move forward no sense in looking back
so this is
this is kind of interesting becausea lot of people being laid off it's like
you know these are people who are most
likely very like productive great
employees greater what they do so
it's not necessarily that they're being
laid off because they're not worth it or
something like that soI don't really think it's like if you
were in that role and then you go back
like it's because you're not taking
steps forward in your career
so I don't want this this there to be
the stigma that people being laid off or
because they're not good at what they do
because that's not the case
yeah yeah and especially in this like
the in this I guess wave of layoffs
umso yeah but people will make different
decisions based on their own their own
life for sure
you two are very talented have you
thought about making your own business
as a contractor if you got laid off
someone said this the other day I can't
remember who mentioned this I think it
was on the stream that I did I think I'd
consider it
um
I think it might be difficult between us
both because worship is based in Canada
and I'm based here in the US so
building a business or starting a
business yeah we're both in different
countries might be leave to like have we
will have to read a lot of paperwork
yeah and there's probably a lot of stuff
that would be maybe limitations or
something like that um
but I mentioned that I would want to
turn learn a cloud into something that
could make money I was going to say that
we already like kind of work on
something together so that's my my
loyalty is to learn the cloud that's the
only loyalty I'll have when it comes to
some sort of cloud entity it's to learn
the class why we both have signs here
uh I was a high performer with bonuses
still got laid off yeah yeah no one is
no one is safe when it comes to layoffs
there's no way of being layoff proof
oh yeah
it's just if you're if your whole team
needs to go you're you're they will take
your whole team off and that's why I
think your point about you know it's not
the talent or the skill that people are
being laid off uh based on their like
you know skill or Talent it's not that
currently at least because if you think
of it in a way that you know they were
still engineers at Google they were
still engineers at Microsoft so they
have been working at least
majority of them have been working for a
year or more right yeah um so they got
to be like good skilled uh individuals
it's just a business need that has
changed now and it's caused
to be laid off
yeah there's a bunch of different
reasons why it's like it's hard to
it's hard to pinpoint and it's like a
lot of science either yeah uh someone
said okay conspiracy time people are
making too much money so fire everyone
because inflation isn't working
I've heard this a lot
like they're just gonna have to fire
people until I mean and it's just not in
Tech this is in general
fire people until uh this inflation
situation gets uh situatedit was looking something up I haven't
been laid off before but I've returned
to company slice after leaving themI don't think I've ever been in a
position where I've wanted to return to
a company that I've been at but if I did
want to I'd reach out that's why it's
important to not burn Bridges
yeah yeah
um I think yeah you know about this
story about me considering the
counteroffer that I was given at UCI to
stay yes but I definitely blowing the
bridge there with the company that I was
hired at yeah yeah but
yeah I've never been in a situation
where
like I was laid off or fired and then
later reached outum that's the closest I've been is given
a counter offer and
um to join the devops team in the state
yeah no I get it
maybe to monetize learn to Cloud you
could have more advanced projects
paywall so this is the vicious circle
that I was talking about the other day
if we turn
monetization like a goal for learning
cloud and content that means we turn
into course makers that means we have to
create courses and as they need to be
updated we need to update courses and
then we kind of fall into the circle of
like well how do we make up skill how do
we you know
foreign
yeah like how do we maintain our skills
relevant if we're focused on making
courses
um
so that's why I really haven't perceived
that it's also why I don't want to
become a YouTuber full-time or make
courses for a living or anything like
that it's just because it's not really
what I'm interested in
um just the issue with like when you put
something behind a paywall it's like
people have expectations
so
it's tough that's not something I'm
personally interested in doingI want to learn to be an entrepreneur
and using cloud or somewhere on cloud
related business don't know how or what
yeah but it's my goal I have um this
interest inuh moving to South America and opening a
cloud consultant the consultancy agency
consultant agency there like later on
umbut not here
uh
they often lay off high salaries staffs
and new projects initiatives that aren't
the main Revenue generating yeah but at
the same time they
they I saw there was some layoffs in
azure
soit's like there's no real there's no
real rule here I feel like if they just
want to lay you off they will lay you
off and they'll try to make up a rule to
say like to justify it but ultimately
anyone can get laid off I don't like
that people try to like
I think it's I I think it's natural
human
uh like attitude to be like oh what can
I do or like how can I
justify or how can I I make sure it's
not going to be me like oh like okay I'm
in a very like high Revenue uh
generating project I'm gonna be fine
because I found myself doing this it's
like
I performed very well I got a great
bonus I got a promotion like I'm totally
fine but then that kind of gives I feel
like that sets you up for more
of like a like stress or more of like an
expectation if it does ultimately happen
to you I think it's better to just
accept the fact that like they're gonna
lay off no matter what so
you can leave it open if you wantyeah
um
I don't know if it was set up this way
but this microphone seems to have an
echo
do you have an echo do you hear me with
an echo not you I think it's meum you know how you have that monitor
saying where you hear yourself
yeah I don't have that on but I still
hear you like hear my voice
coming into my headphones I don't know
if it'sdo you have like the tab open somewhere
in YouTube and you're sharing desktop
audio no
no okay who's whose audio is is it is
this his repeating or is it mine that's
repeating it's you I feel yeah I can
hear ithold on let's seeyeah someone just confirmed this it's
mine yeah his mic has an echoodd is it pulling
it's not a bad Echo it's his his his
uh
[Music]
but it's not that bad so it's like a
delay like you're hitting my voice twice
I guess no thank you for letting us know
Mark I just don't know what it is
because mine is set to audiolet me see because yeah I can definitely
hear my voice
in my headphones which I don't
it's like I don't have monitoring on
wait so let me mute myself and do you
still hear yourself like continue
talking okay
yeah I don't hear myself
okay so it's me
all right let me figure stuff out
continue answering questions in the chat
okayand yeah thank you Chad for letting us
know
um yeah I definitely not hear myself so
let let me know if it is good now so if
there is no Echo let us know so that
means it's something going on
um Gwen's new
tool
if not then I'll try some other audio
devices how about now do you still hear
yourself yeah I can hear myself again
what is it
okay yeah so the audience did confirm it
was fixed
umso when you're muted
I don't hear myself and the audience is
not hearing an echo
and then you unmute yourself which means
your microphone is picking your voice
but how does it replicate mine it's
weird
like I've never seen that ughum Malik says really appreciate that you
all have that perspective
many just want to sell courses so let
Gwen get back and probably
she also has some more
um
a good opinion on this but yeah
the
I think the idea when you know go and
started streaming and like started
YouTube and same for me I know we shared
this in the 2022
oh
live stream we had with day and Kev was
that
for us it's like the engineering mindset
like we love doing what we do we love
working
um like for me it's you know devops and
Cloud for Gwen it's cloud and a few
things of devops similar interests and
then they it was cyber
um and then Kev Works in it
I hear myself again damn it
a lot of people are saying that
um ohum a lot of people are saying it's not a
bad act it's like they can understand
hear and understand both of us when we
are talking
back and forth yeah distinct though
oh it broke the bottom of thesorry the poster thing fell in it like
chipped the thing there was a security
deposit
it's a displayed right so it's like
metallic yeah yeah that's why
I'll leave it open it's too hightoo how's my girlfriend
Channing she wants to talk on the phone
but she doesn't want to be heard on
stream like they're not gonna hear you
yeah
we could barely hear the
displayed falling
oh really it was not too loud so yeah oh
my goodness this thing is amazing if I
figure out why it's routing your voice
to the main thing
let me seeyeah
so yeah Malik
um that being said you know we are
always love creating
uh good Cloud Solutions good devops
Solutions
yeah I don't hear myself you're good now
yeah I'm goodyeah now we'll see uh some comments in
the chat we should at least but yeah
that'll be sad yeah we don't we don't
have the goal to sell courses and that's
why I learned Cloud exists that's why
it's open source that's why it's free
that's why it's Community Driven and all
of the other stuff that we have been
advocating for and it's gonna stay that
wayokay I think we're good now I just said
you're it was it was routing your the
the PC audio to the main channel so
that's why oh so we're good now I got
this really fancy it's called a rode Pro
Caster uh and it's what gives amazing
quality to this thing but it's also like
it's way more complex than what I'm used
to so I'm still trying to understand how
everything works on it but it has cool
effects which is how I did that thingy
okay cool let's see South America let's
go yeah I am
when I lived in Ecuador I saw that there
was a lot of
uh Microsoft presence in terms of like
tech there so I have a feeling like
having
um something like it AWS based or Azure
based company
that would Implement that kind of stuff
would be
uh
yeah lucrative and have lots of
opportunitiesokay all these are echo echo echo I
think Owen's room is haunted oh my
goodness I'm like I'm more upset that
the thing chipped I wish I could show
you guys but it chipped the you know how
the bottom of the walls have I don't
know what this called
oh I see yeah like it's like a wood
detail or something like that yeah like
a slab thing like a long slab
shipped it so now I'm sure like when I
move out of here
it's gonna I had I had a similar thing I
had a it was not a displayed but it was
like a Ronaldo's uh wooden like it was
painted on a wooden piece
um
yeah and my brother had it behind the
monitor like on the monitor resting on
the monitor it fell down broke the same
thing in my apartment I'll send you a
picture like it chipped it yeah really
bad yeahum bad moments
I'm telling you
it's the layoff energyyep
power voice carries inevitable power
voice carries and inevitable I don't
understand that
how's the back end project for learning
cloud coming from my iPhone yeah let's
see how much learning cloud costs let me
bring up the portalumso let's move this over here
to go to all right sopresent
your screen share screen is your screen
all right
uh hiking comment all right cool
so last 24 hours we've had oh no this is
last five minutes 700 787 sight hits
let's take a look I always like to look
the last let's do this last seven days
cool oh I'm also pulling up like actual
visitor data
we've had 141
000 sight hits maybe we can have more
like last 30 days because we've been
live for like
two 200 800 no 283 900.
site hits okay so that's just you get a
feel of kind of for the traffic but
we'll have actually visitor data when we
should pull set up
uh learn a clown
is
I feel like because we had that second
Azure static web app for like a like a
day or so like it might have given like
thrown off our estimates but
it's totally fine let's seeI I was uh saying that we were gonna hit
like 30 a month but I think we're
already our forecast is already
passing yeah our forecast is 38 dollars
I was going to say 48 oh my goodness I
said 15 yeah you did say 50. so we're
probably we're gonna go above that but
you're right that we added a second
static web app did you clean that up
like did you delete it or no yeah yeah
yeah yeah okay cool
oh no do look our grafana what VM are we
using we are using a B2 it's a small one
it's not it's supposed to turn it off
no we should use container apps
yeah yeah insteadoh
oh did I turn it off I'll I'll take a
look let's look because it's like
already we've had that for like what
less than a week like a couple of days
it's already a couple of days yeah
compared to
yeah
okay that's see
yeah Richard what the heck let's look at
thatumyeah it's on the top favor hit a like
hit a like on that stream so we can hit
100 people watching
B2 I that's on rishab
I'm firing you right now
but hey I was using it almost daily I
was trying to figure out how to get yeah
I was trying to figure out how to get
the
like the Azure stuff but they also have
a plug-in for Google analytics now so
like we were like this was a solution
like everything would be solved because
we can have Azure app insights and like
the cost Monitor and also we could have
the Google analytics that we use for you
know user stuff
but yes it's a three dollar one can we
do this one no no it's fine it's fine
we'll I'll create a container and we'll
use container apps yeah yeah
um because you know we here we are all
about Cloud native
if I want to run the grafana I could run
it on Raspberry Pi which would be a cool
project butcool so then that's going to save us
some money there yeah look at us
stay in that fifty dollars
okay so I have last seven days of data
we had two point
4K userswhich is
68 percent more traffic
compared to any other seven days in the
last year
so that how that's how the percentage
Compares 2.7 K in the last seven days
yesand I'll tell you last 28 is which means
like since we
when did we go live January 9th
uh but I guess the Google analytics we
turned it on on so that was a couple
days after
a week after January 13th so
January 13 to January 19th yeah
that is the last seven days the last
seven days two point oh my goodness
we're like a successful small startup
except we don't make any money
yeah
4.3k sessions
damn we have nine people that are on
learn to Cloud right now all organic
traffic people no ads no marketing I
mean I guess social media kind of counts
marketing but the fact that this thing
still gets this much traffic a year over
a year
since lunch
but well we can say organic marketing
like we haven't run ads on Twitter we
haven't run ads on YouTube right
um correct correct correct okay we are
using our personal brandsyeah I mean I guess that shows like if
someone want to task like what's the
power of your personal brand you could
just show show these kind of metrics
right because you know there's like
people out there there's influence out
there with like millions in audience and
then they can't sell like 15 t-shirts oh
yeah yeah like so
um a few of you may know that I want the
developer 30 and the 30 world right
yeah I forgot you you won that
doors like they they look at public
contributions
what are my public contributions
95 of them were to learn to Cloud
so they looked over into Cloud they're
like oh this is free so like I feel like
learn to Cloud played a huge role in me
winning that award
um because they look at
the free stuff you do for the community
like that award specifically looks at
the free stuff that you do for students
for community
kind of thing so
yeah like from personal Brands
perspective yeah like it it is a really
good
like we have great numbers
which comes from the value that it
provides
yeah
like
all these vanity metrics like retweets
and likes and stuff like that I don't
really mean much in my opinion
yeah and like someone who said if we
think
like if learn to cloud or like if Gwen
and I get laid off and we still want to
keep this runningI think
like I I don't know I'm just gonna put
this out let me know what you think what
we would have banner ads
probably something like that two
generator revenue and it will generate a
lot of Revenue yeah at least much that
could cover our hosting costs
because of the amount of traffic we haveyeah if um
we have a road map for issues and stuff
that we're implementing so for example
create status dashboard
uh create API that will show Cloud
definition on the home page enable app
insights Implement search feature oh we
got the configuration for this by the
way so we should get on this
oh we did yeah we got the email with all
the details that we need for this cool
oh yeah approved
um Hospital Azure with dashboard with
monitoring metrics implement this is
done isn't this
yes
all right we forgot to move this over oh
because we were having issues with
merging to the main thing that was weird
Okay cool so that's done
we're probably we we have a weekly stand
up where we add or remove to this uh and
then we we put this on the home page in
case anyone wants to get some Hands-On
Cloud experience like in production this
isn't like some tutorial or some course
you're actually going to build something
that and we have it in a way that as
soon as you
you know you'd have your PR you submit
it we can generate a URL for you to
actually see it live it's not going to
be like learn a cloud.guy but it's going
to be like a like a staging like so you
can actually see your contributions
in real life so if anyone wants to work
on anything that we have here you just
can't you know go into your GitHub
account go to the link of our backlog
and then comment hey I want to work on
this I know someone had mentioned they
want to work on which one is it this one
the status dashboard no no no
um the other one
no it's this one these are
oh I almost work on this one and then
someone Works to work on what works on
the search one the search feature I'm
pretty sure we could find someone who
would want to work on this one too app
insights because it's all JavaScript
stuff
yeah
um for me the focus was the dev
container
so I have a branch oh
sum it up here
um Dev container support so oh sorry
GitHub code spaces support so that
people can they don't have to worry
about
gonna see I don't see an issue in here
for that I'll create one
damn it rishab itI need this I need this now we need
tickets for all this stuff you know yeah
so that we talked about it and you're
like
so these are the tickets that I have oh
I'm like okay you're still here yeah
these are the tickets we have this is
what we are welcome we are going to work
on then we were towards the end of the
call we were like oh by the way the dev
container stuff is like old and we would
have to support you know docusarus
instead of doxify
oh and that reminds me since I mentioned
docs I'm gonna create a ticket because I
will forget we have to clean up doxify
Branch it's still running on GitHub
Pages for no reasonI'm gonna do that yeah add that ticket
and add the the dev container.json which
is what enables code spaces yes yeah add
that too and I'm gonna go through some
of these questions here the baseboard I
got some Frosted Flakes y'all
that's my girlfriend's favorite cereal
Frosted Flakes
is Linux Survivor a good program to
learn Linux on I just went through basic
commands and file name structures and
now I'm on Linux security it seems
intuitive and very easy to like I don't
think I've ever heard of Linux Survivor
it's pretty good all right
um Kev I think I heard it from Kev
Tech yeah yeah shout out kevtech it's
it's pretty good I recommended it to my
brother-in-law because he was he's
preparing for Linux Essentials and he's
not
um like he needed some practice with
like actual uh command line
terminal like he has installed stuff but
he needed some challenges like a gaming
like gamified method to learn command
line so Linux Survivor is pretty good
nice
I also plug myself I have a bash for
beginners course coming out soon in the
next couple of weeks we wrapped up
recording yesterday
uh editing is in the works I gotta do
all the the marketing I gotta write a
blog post got to put in all the metadata
all that kind of stuff but you know
that's halfway done so
uh that'll be out soon we're covering oh
we're covering a lot we're covering
permissions recovering setting up your
environment we're covering Loops
functions uh variables what is your bash
script uh what else did I do oh my
goodness case statements conditional
statements redirection Pipelines
viewing files making files making
folders and there's a bunch of stuff
there so
be sure to check that out that'll be on
YouTube uh free for all
in a couple of days not a couple days a
couple of weeks I'll if you if you
follow me on YouTube I always Post in
the community my community tab updates
to that because everyone seems to be
excited for that onehappy hey gangs everyone what up Daryl
how you doing
look at that smash that like if you
haven't please smash that like button do
it for a bit bit is the Azure advocacy
mascots
he's
he's pretty cool I think he's one of the
coolest mascots
we got these plushies here and even the
tag says
the tag is custom Microsoft Azure tag
attention to detail yeah it's like the I
like the oh also the backpack the back
thereum where's your beep the beep featurethere we goyeah so yeah hit that like button
thanks for the stream Lucas said how
yeah you're quick with that
I couldn't even find that if I had to
comment it
um that's that's good I have the the
YouTube window open on the right hand
side and you you know
so I'm mod for Gwen's chat and I'm like
it popped up it's saying oh the message
is held for review because it contains
something something I'm like what and
then I click on show
that was quick that was quick
okay so I have the one issue in
creating the second one
uh and get startedit's a really good unorganized page that
it's impossible not to share with your
friends who also want to learn about
cloud services thank you I appreciate
thatreally do I
to be honest I don't really remember
putting it together
because it was kind of a blur because I
just tweeted it out and then I was like
okay now I have to make it and then over
the next two days I was just like
non-stop wrote it
but it's definitely evolved since thenbut we did put a lot of work into the
organization so it's like a neat
progression as you go through it
so thank you for that feedback
smash that like if you haven't alreadyupdate Dev containerto supportdocusauruscool coolthat's a long-term goal of mine to learn
now and one day be able to give back as
you both do give back at any stage that
you're at I would say
I really I regret and I regret because I
didn't know about it but
if I could have gone like helped us days
and started documenting my journey then
that would be the coolest stuff I think
that's the only regret like if close to
regret is like
starting that process sooner than later
that would have been so cool to just
have like my first help desk gig and
then now then like like eight like a
year ago joining Microsoft I think that
would be really freaking cool to see
that progression but
I kind of started to like halfway
through my I guess current career so not
that bad but it would have been cool to
have
like earlier earlier stuff for sure
yeah
Raspberry Pi exists
are so possible to get one now it is
impossible they're so expensive so so
expensive I remember we got them for
bulk in 2018 or 19 and I'm glad I hold
like a hell to one of them this was also
given to me by like ECI it's a shout out
for paying for a Raspberry Pi
but we like both ordered a few of them
and they were like thirty dollars each
because it was a bull Carter and now if
I try to get one first of all it's not
in stock yeah if it is it's like 150 or
200 dollars
crazyI remember I got one to make a video
game emulator at my cloud engineer got
job because that office was pretty cool
they had like a projector ping pong
table and whatever so and on the end of
Fridays we would play it just video
games
so my boss was like oh I want to play
the classics
so I was like we should get a Raspberry
Pi and he was like okay get it expense
it so I bought one I think I got one
with like I think the packet the whole
product is called like a canary because
it comes like with a case yeah it was
like a white case and like it's really
nice
I think that was like 40 bucks
oh something like that yeah
but this was 2018 so
big difference now
banner ads
what up Anna
wait this is different and I thought
this was
that this was the Anna that I knew or is
it the Anna that I know maybe not I
think that's that's Anna with two ends
but hello Anna but she's also from
Brazil so
hello Anna from Brazil
oh I know who you're talking about yeah
yeah Anna AWS Anna hey um keeping mine
docked for the for the win doc waitthank you my doctor for the win
like you're using Docker on yours
yeah could besee what else did I
think one's room is hauntedI'm scared of ghosts I don't say stuff
like thatyou play the
how do you play so many zombie games
I think I do it because
I want to face my fears
yeahface your fearshey y'all just wanted to know that I
just applied some advice they gave me
during a liveduring a live message for Caldwell just
started a software just started a role
as a software product manager with a
cloud Focus ah good for you
congratulations congratulations do we
have some kind of
no claps oh come on
I'll have to load it for the next one
um that's awesome Omar I I'm sure I've
I've seen your name multiple times
before and we we've been in I guess
uh you've been on our streams for a
while now so that's awesome
I'm curious what advice it was because I
can't remember but
um that's awesome software product
manager with a cloud Focus
congratulations we're very very happy
for you keep us umkeep us updated with how it goes for
sure
yeah I think I see his face a lot on
LinkedIn too
and it's been like a year or more that
I've seen
pretty active
snaps
Lucas Lucas H says snaps for Omar love
it
what up Ciscomany thanks what you do is important oh
thank you some days we I want to quit
YouTube
so I mean all the time I want to quit
YouTube so
it's stuff like that that keeps me going
I I constantly tell rishab I'm like I
don't really know if I want to do this
anymore
so I I have those days
lately I've been having it a lot more
but
thank you I appreciate it
uh what else okay on Raspberry Pi three
so I was replying while you guys were
discussing piottagespeaking about pies
there's this Organic Market
that sells the most delicious
apple pies I've ever had oh okay and
they have
and they're there every Saturday morning
I was just telling Gigi this I'm like oh
my gosh we have to go tomorrow to get a
piece of that pie because so good with
some coffee oh my God
it's so freaking good
I I keep coming back to this because
this is amazing this is amazinghere's a question for you if land to
Cloud had a mascot what animal it would
be
a robot that's not an animal though
it has to be an animal oh my goodness
for real
don't say crocodile
no I want to say something like a wolf
mm-hmm can it be a dinosaur
it can't be a dinosaur they existed
right so that counts yeah yeah yeah
dinosaur Maybe
like a T-Rex so badass
I'm wearing like a hoodie with yeah
Cloud would be nice
uh yeah oh someone said an eagle
it's called a cloud barfing a rainbow I
feel like someone has that as like yeah
I've seen the sticker somewhere like it
reminds me of a sticker that has like a
Silver Cloud and like rainbow coming out
and like the the
yeah super shiny eyes
barfing rainbow I've seen that
yeah yeah apple versus pecan
Apple
all day I'm like a such a classics
Classics type person
here's the question rishab do you do you
ever drink soda
yeah so Coke or Pepsi
it's a million dollar question
youcan I go out of the way and say a thumbs
uphave you have you ever had thumbs up the
the drink the the drink thumbs up
yeah it's a it's a really close to Coke
and Pepsi but we used to have that in
India it looks like Pepsi though it
looks more like maybe because of The
Branding yeahum I'll say I'll say Coke yeah you're
done
foreignyeah just like blocking you I'll block
your number yeah I'll remove you from
the GitHub repo and yeah made a pull
request resha was removed because he
loves Cokeyeah there's a right wrong and the
answer to this pecans are classic like
Coke okay so okay I I would agree
but there was I just I watched this
documentary on Netflix that was like all
about how Pepsi and the like I think 80s
or 90s they said that you could win a
jet
oh yeah yeah the documentary is the
where's my million dollar jet yeah
something like that where is my jet
Pepsi something yeah yeah
oh my gosh someone says nobody drinks
Pepsi that's a lie it's a lie I it's a
lie I don't drink soda often but when I
do it's either Pepsi or
um Seven Up
oh that's a good one
dude begins dwarfs no
no no this is
this is not oh someone asked a good
question here how do you guys make your
coffee and how many cups do you go
through in a work day one I drink it
black with a little bit of sugar
and restaurant is a monster so he just
drinks it black with nothing see now I
need that effect that rishab drinks
black coffee like really deep voice but
yes
um I used to drink
I I think you know this but I used to
drink like two or three cups yeah in the
day
uh in like nine hours of my day
and I have dialed it down to like just
one cup in the morning and that's it
um and I yeah I usually I got this new
machine
like the Nespresso something it makes a
really good coffee
uh but yeah no sugar no cream I can't I
don't think I can handle cream because
it gets like
I feel full
the beginning of the day and I can't do
that like it I don't knowwhen people say pecan instead of instead
of pecan pecan big secret who the hell
says pecanNoah says pecan
pecan
pecan
I don't think I've ever heard that
Aeropress see sometimes I'm like I want
to get super fancy with my coffee but
then I'm like I don't have the time for
this I also drink one cup that I barely
finish
that's true I like I'll sip it through
the morning and then once it's like four
o'clock I don't allow myself to have
anything with caffeine because if I do I
can't sleep so
then I just like if it's there I just
have to like put it away or something or
you save it and then the next morning
you can make iced coffee
yeah the only reason I got that machine
is
I'm gonna be honest here like
if if people say I'm cheap that's fine
uh the Black Friday event was on the
coffee machine usually goes for like 180
dollars and with taxes it's 200 and like
I'm never getting a coffee machine
that's 200 but then I saw people getting
800 worth of machine so I'm like okay
this is justifiable because I love
coffee and I want to make it at home but
I'm going down this Rabbit Hole so like
bear with me
um the Black Friday deal they said the
machine is for sixty dollars plus you
getum you get like 50 capsules free for
that machine nice I'm like this is a
steal
so I bought it right off the bat yeah
you can and they also gave me a frother
to
fraud the cream which I don't drink so
it's just sitting there collecting dust
but the coffee machine is being used so
that's great
so it's one capsule per cup
yeah
okayI feel like that's a good deal it is
could do if I'll do for years and you're
disappointing me more and more in the
Stream let's go more hot takes Coke
sucks
if you canum
what's another really hot take
tabs versus speciesuh
uh now now I will end the end the
Friendship here let's see no no I don't
have a preference it's whatever the
convention is for the language because
it's like some language what is the
convention on learn to clouds code okay
there you go we have a lot of yamlers we
have yaml isn't that spaces
are you sure isn't yamo like four spaces
or something like that so you could use
Taps right because you're saving
clicking the spaces four times
but what it because languages have like
oh you're supposed like they're they're
best practices
no no usually not yeah it doesn't pythonlike I have my own preference I don't
know what people use
uh Max or better than PC no ew what I
use I use whatever I use text yeah yeah
I used tabs I used tabs yeah I just do
Ctrl shift p and I do format and then
whatever it puts it at that's what I use
you can change that too to be honest
whatever the default is yeah
safe answers Glenn I need a hot take
from you never mind HTML is not a
programming language that's a hot take
that's like the the generic Twitter HOT
take
why though
uh question is why no no I don't think
so I'm just joking I don't really care I
never really thought about it to be
honest yeah I have not but then I
realized when I was in high school it
was considered like not considered but
if you tell like what are some electives
you are taking it came under
computer programming yeah so like if
it's not a programming language like why
are you even learning it like in that
curriculum is what I'm trying to say so
if the education system thinks that
like
who are you the question
yeah but Twitter is a different you know
world uh so
someone's gonna claimed thatcome at metry to cancel me
Mountain Dew switch let me hold on I'll
be right back I'm just gonna switch this
desk down
keep answering your thoughts on Mountain
Dew
you can see
yeah we can still hear you
it's a good it's a good soda
won't lie
um but yeah it's not the one that I pick
I don't know why
like if I'm given a choice I don't pick
Mountainum but if I'm given wanting you I won't
say no
if that makes sense
this is the cloud God
foreignis here what's up love it sounds like a
like a Tony Hawk combo
yeah I was gonna say it sounds like a
Azure certification but
I just took the no skills 900
[Laughter]
there's a hot take no
um Mac only has the terminal going for
it
there you go Rodney I don't know but now
with WSL like what's the what's the
answer there
see
you won't get like a hot debate out of
me and Gwen because we have Windows
users
really good custom PCS and I know Rodney
you're also a custom PC person
so like don't start this debate here but
we do also have personal Max so like for
laptops or portable systems we do have
M1 Max and we are completely happy with
them
um so yeah whatever works for us we try
to use it to our advantage to be fair I
don't use it often that often
like I might use it like once yeah yeah
it's more for like you know if you're
out and you're staying somewhere else
for like longer period and you need a
personal system I love this this setup
that I have here like custom PC cam 4k
monitor other monitor mic like this is
just perfect for me when I work off a
laptop I just find like I don't know
what to do with the display of the
laptop
because if I close it then I feel like
I'm wasting the retina display that the
Mac has if I open it it's this is such a
first world issue and I hate myself for
saying this but it's just true if I open
it and I'm like oh I'm just trying to
focus on looking at the screen but it's
so darn small
so
I just like PC setups better
um
the only thing I like about the Mac is
you can program App application that's
so true
now to do there's no way to build Mac or
iOS apps at least that I know of yeah
you need a you need a Mac machine to
build
the entire directory structure of how
you submit and stuff which is weird
Mr Muffin that's a cool name I wish PCS
were able to do that somehow yeahis the command line code
um no it's
like every operating system have their
own kind of version of command line it's
a cool hacky thing that you see in
movies and documentaries like black
screen white texts and Landscaping green
text and someone's like oh what are they
doing they're like oh I'm hacking into
the system so command line is uh it's a
text-based program that allows you to
you know run some kind of actions or
interact with a machine or like for
example
you know when you work with AWS you have
the Azure command line when you work
with m i mean when you work with AWS you
have the AWS command line Azure Azure
command line Docker a bunch of programs
have command lines
um
so it's not necessarily
a language or anything itself it's just
a text-based program
then the
depending on how like what the Oink the
command line is usually
um
abbreviated by CLI
uh and then depending on how your CLI
works like you'll have to have different
commands like you know different
functionality
um but the majority of clis if not all
of them
integrate very well with bash which is a
shell and also a language and
essentially a universal language when it
comes to working with servers because
the majority of the cloud runs on Linux
and the like a lot like I don't even
know the percentage but of the majority
of Linux servers will allow you to use a
Bash
so yeah that's that's I think someone
asked us about hold on
oh my goodness yeah so that's what the
CLI is
do you think like technically else would
have happened if you didn't fire anyone
yes
guys what programming language would you
recommend to get into devops python yaml
this is Richard's Channel now yes it is
Richard's Channeluh you say you wanna you want to quit
YouTube but lately I've seen a lot of
GPS content via YouTube we do appreciate
it
the more I make content it's because the
more I want to quit so the more I'm
convincing myself to not quit by making
more there's a little tidbit
laughs
start with bash follow them yeah
everyone needs to know the baby oh yeah
that's it that's it don't argue with me
Richard
Cloud the cloud gods have spoken
change the voice
you must learn bash to become one with
the cloud
there we go
I have said this so many times that I
was so fortunate my college diploma had
Linux and advanced Linux as a course
because when I entered help desk like I
was people would think I was so smartand type in the name of the directory
not only that like I was really
comfortable with grip and stuff and like
I remember some yeah some Engineers
seeing me like going through log files
using grep and they're like oh you know
grab and I'm like yeah
um so yep it's like it's a cheap like it
it really helps and if you try to avoid
it
I'm gonna say this you you will have to
come back and learn it um yeah you
definitely will I today Caroline tweeted
something like you don't need to know
Linux to get into Thai tea you don't
need to know Linux to get into
this admin and etc etc and I was trying
to understand her point of view I think
a lot of people when they say like you
should learn Linux they just mean that
you shouldn't know how to use a command
line
and it's one of those things like if
you're a beginner
um
becoming comfortable with the command
line is like super important but it's
more so like oh which one do you learn
like you could do like command prompt
Powershell uh or bash but ultimately
bash is just more popular so that's why
I recommend people learn it and nowadays
you know with Windows having WSL and and
like all these Cloud platforms having
CLI it's like I just really don't see
why someone wouldn't want to learn it soWSL is great as well different
stokes-stricken folks yeah
yeah that's what we use
um
for like the windows term in the lab
where can you find your bash course
which you recently finished when did I
say that I finished this course tell me
this is what like gets to me sometimes
when I say I give people constant
updates let's yesterday I literally
posted
I finished recording and it's off to
editing so where did I say where did
this misinformation come from
but anyway the recording is done it's on
to the editor so it's going to take a
few I don't know maybe like two weeks or
so and then we'll figure out
a launch day around the time
learn get up get ups for Bash what the
heck is get Ops for bash it will help
with structuring your codeyou mean GitHub sorry get UPS like get
UPS is a thing like GI g-i-t get UPS
oh no
um get ops command in Linux with
examples
it's a very convenient best scripting
utility which helps you to conveniently
and gracefully handle the passing of
flags an argument in a clean
standardized manner instead of having
the developer manually handle the flags
passed to a script this provides a handy
way of handling this when iterating
through a while loop
interesting well get Ops
I mean no colon the dolet go check if how do I andah poor hosting okay interestingway
yeah I've never heard of this no same
here
good to know yeah good to know I've
heard of get UPS yeah that's that's why
I was like get UPS
apps warp terminal on Mac is the only
thing I'm jealous of I've never heard of
that either yeah I've heard about it but
just on
like social media[Music]
I see CLI commands I have a whole
session on that on my channel I don't
know if it's on my channel but you can
find it yeah it is
uh using yeah how to become proficient
with the Azure CLI in bash something
like that it's on my channel you can
find it I did a whole hour session on
that
how much of a role does intelligent play
in a high position that you guys are in
or do you believe anyone can do it I'm
not in a high positionthe audience expecting that you're gonna
say I'm not intelligent
no I'm intelligent I'm not in a high
positionI feel like a lot of people like to
downplay and say like oh yeah yeah you
can
you don't have to uh study you don't
have to be super smart you don't have to
be like you know I like I'm like dumb as
rocks and I can do this no
you have to have a skill set an ability
for sure definitely
but you don't have to be a genius
but it's not like people go and throw
rocks at like some random person but
like okay you can come be in this role
like it's not that's not the reality
either but you don't you don't have to
be you know you don't need a PhD for
this stuff either definitely not
uh how much does all intelligence play
in a hype job position that you guys are
in or do you believe anyone can do it
I believe anyone can do it but not a lot
of people have the
I guess I don't know what it takes to
like face the amount of rejection that
it takes to get into like
um
like a tech role not even just in like
big Tech just like get a tech role in
general you because it's so competitive
like you're gonna have to go through a
bunch of a bunch of rejections sometimes
people can't do it I think there's a lot
more of like people skills that go into
landing a role like resiliency patience
yeah um how emotionally mature you can
handle yourself in like with rejection
and interviewing and stuff like that so
can every can anyone do that sure can
everyone do it probably not
um but if if you're willing to put
yourself through it then I can see yeahuh
would you define Bash
I think I just did right yeah
y'all got to have me on here come on
come on right now let me
how do I send you a link are you on
Discord
uh yeah or you want to learn to Cloud
Discord if you want to learn to Cloud
Discord I'll send you a link right now
and come on you just one you need to
make sure you have decent audio and
Camera uh two you need to make sure
you're not going to be disrespectful and
come on here with like conspiracy
theories or anything like that
uh that's pretty much it so if you're on
a Discord
do you like at register at maybe a GPS
hey I'm here tell me the link and I'll
send you a link
and that goes for anyone who wants to
come on
I I all the time I offer people come on
stream it doesn't really matter to me
to become a devops engineer to be
comfortable not knowing everything
instead of being an engineer become a t
oh and I have engineer yes yes yes yes
so that's why we love help desk help
desk lets you develop like this high
range of like a bunch of random skills
and then you figure out which one you
like the most and you go deeper in that
but you carry all these like like
like there's a wide range of skills and
you have you keep like upskilling in
them upskilling upskilling whatever but
you're you're proficient in one thing
but you're very aware of the other thing
the other day someone was saying like is
it important for web developers to know
Cloud I would say yes because ultimately
your stuff ends up being deployed in the
cloud
and then you are aware of it right yepuh hi from San Francisco to use for
technical illustrations I use escalidraw
yep same tools I used to use draw.io a
lot
um in my cloud engineering gig and I
also realized like there was a python
pack you could use to
um draw
technical illustrations which was really
impressive
but yeah excally draw for like anything
that you see on learn to cloud or on our
streams or videosthat question or phrase that dude what
question is this did I miss something
I'm not looking at the YouTube I'm just
looking at the story mode so
um if you go to learn to Cloud dot guide
on the top right you can hit Discord and
that should take us to your Discord I
mean take
you to our Discord yeah what question is
thatum
let us know is I think it's the one that
you need to be intelligent to be in the
high okay so here we go you did say that
you have 180k salary when you have a
videos yeah
uh I live in Canada oh okay okay so high
paying position
okay I thought you meant like seniority
like are you loving yeah you know I'm
level 62 at Microsoft so that's
technically not
um
like the highest level that you can get
to I don't really know what the highest
level is obviously CEO but I'm talking
more about like and individually
individual contributor I see that they
call ituh so yeah
this is your cousin right yepthis is when we need to get a VPN
sponsor so we could be like and nordvpn
yeah I use a VPN service I'm not gonna
name it until I get to sponsor our
stream
smart uh okay so this is you did say you
have a 180 salary one of your old videos
I remember correctly I live in Canada so
that's considered a high position here
okay
which part of Canada sorry yeah I'm
curious I'm from Canada too so no um
that's why I'm curiousI'll say it
we got let me send this invite over
to this personI swear if you come on here talking
crazyI'll kick you out with the god Boy sign
Ottawa okay
so yeah I'm based out of I don't know Mr
Muffin if you're familiar with like
um but I am often on Gwen's Channel Mr
Muffin I
I was so serious you've hit me now
it's so professionally like
you know Mr Muffin I gotta tell you
oh
no offense
um yeah but Mr Muffin
I can't say it with a straight faceum yeah I'm in Kitchener Waterloo and
like around GTA area and like I've
talked to a few folks and like I think
the average kind of salary and I could
be wrong like let me know
um the average salaryis
150 150 to 1580k or 190k in some cases
for a medium
um level engineer
and this is in Canadian dollars
um so like 150 190 is the sweet spot for
five year four to five years of
experience working in let's say we're
talking about Cloud Engineers like
that's a medium level cloud engineer who
has four to five years of experience I
believe
um
but yeah
I do know that Ottawa has
pretty low salaries I do know that damn
I did some research yeah
is is
Ottawa like a city or what it's a it's
the capital
of what Canada
so it's a city
it's a city yeah I thought Toronto was
the capital what no Toronto is not the
capital
otherwise where all the government stuff
is
um otherwise where the parliament is uh
DC yeah yeah
so so a lot of government jobs but that
also means a lot of
less pain
makes sense makes sense why an average
would be lower there
uh all right so do you need to be
intelligent to get a high paying job
I think it's 50 50. I definitely do
think it's 50 well no no so 50 50 skill
set and then 50 like people skills but
that also involves luck there's a lot of
luck to Landing a lot of being at the
right place at the right time a lot of a
lot of knowing the right people like
that like there's there'slook at this Toronto's the budget New
York
it is not anymore it's so expensive I
get it New York is expensive but Toronto
is also really expensive
um okay now we are getting into hot
takes what have you started Gwen wait
hold on what's your take on this
LinkedIn healthy argument what
many companies are expecting devops to
write all day while we do I saw this
before we help spread the word and clear
up the confusion many companies are
expecting devops to write code what the
heck is devops like a devops engineer
yeah yeah
like many companies I saw this post many
companies are like when they post or are
interviewing an engineer they expect you
to write code during those interviews
but
um
usually we do like scripts and like
grammal and python here and there and go
coding is not the main focus so help
spread the word and clear up the
confusion was this person
who I can't name because I don't know
like I read this post
um
I would say coding zero percent is not
true
in devops when I was in devops
I did wrote like I see
modules and if you use palumi they have
Python sdks and that's how you write IC
so you need to be familiar with how you
define a function how you define a class
how to write Loop right and all of those
for me they come under programming I
won't say those are scripts right
um
so I don't know like it's not zero
coding
but it's also not like
I think it's the narrative is changing
now
um some companies are expecting you to
at least understand what the code is
written right and even if you don't
write itI think it goes back to the fact that
just rolls in Tech in general are never
really accurate like that's why that's
why Cloud engineer everywhere is
different that's why solution architect
everywhere is different and the
expectation is like
so my issue with this statement is like
you this this was clearly made for
engagement instead of actually trying to
make a difference because
you're just not going to change it
that's just a reality the only thing we
can do is
pay attention more to the descriptions
and
you know not go for the world title
itself
yeah
but yeah it's just like it's because the
people who make the rules and just and
aren't usually not like an engineering
team
it's also like the other thing right
um
so I I was talking to my non-tech
friends and the idea is if you're a
Content at a company X you'll probably
do same time
so my brother is an accountant if your
accountant a company X and if you go to
accountant like same position at a
company why it's gonna be same like it's
gonna it's probably gonna be like pretty
similar I can imagine yeah in Tech it's
really subjective to like each company
um yeah same thing with like doctors and
stuff like if you're a doctor you're a
doctor it doesn't matter if you work at
a hospital X or it doesn't matter if you
work at a hospital why if you're like a
cardiologist like you you work with hot
right kind of thing can you imagine if a
doctor at another place was expected to
also be the dentist
Jesus is hereJesus hey
we pronounce it correctly that's easy
yeah
first of all don't come up here with
some culture theaters no no I've
actually like I've been following your
guys content for a good minute and uh oh
welcome yeah welcome
tell us about yourself give us your
elevator pitch oh yeah yeah oh man oh
man
uh let's see
um well I have a very diverse background
so uh I was actually in the military for
uh for a few years so I did five years
and then three years reserve uh
came out went to Community College got
an associates and the entire time I've
been in technical support I was a
technical support engineer for a good
minute went and became a technical
support manager and then made the the
transition to devops as I was actually
watching you guys content uh like a
while ago like a long while ago and uh
yeah but I've been a devops engineer now
about a year and a half or like a year
six months whatever but yeah wow so
you've been watching us for a minute if
you yeah
very cool well thank you for for being
in the chat and hopping on I'm sure
people have a lot of questions about
that transition I get a lot of questions
about like hey I'm in the military what
how what should I do I can get this I
can do this and I'm always like I have
no idea I actually have I actually help
a lot of my uh veteran friends or better
connections nice uh you know understand
and navigate the whole GI Bill thing the
loopholes uh the programs out there for
us to get into Tech
um like what so I got out uh from active
duty I got out 2018
and at that time they you know there was
programs so I came out of the Marine
Corps so the Marine Corps we didn't
really have a lot of programs to begin
with the Army the Air Force Navy does
um but at that time they started uh
bringing in what is it the uh Microsoft
systems Academy I had a lot of friends
that actually went through there were
very successful didn't land a job at
Microsoft of course uh but they went on
to work at startups uh and from this
working at startups they moved up like I
came from a startup and uh that's how I
kind of got it into this
very cool what you got certs uh uh Azure
search no so but I do have like asserts
outside of like Azure so
um I have a
let's see I have my the the CompTIA
Triad right so like second close a plus
okay everybody has that one right um I
have my ITIL uh V4 from third I have my
scrub Master cert uh product owner cert
um I have a cyber security cert from the
local Community College I'm currently
doing a
what is it a secure programming cert uh
through local community college students
again it's like it's not just one class
it's a multitude of classes that I've
had to take so uh for this class
currently right now the last class I'm
doing C programming and Java so we're
doing a lot of security stuff
but the the cool thing is it's like I've
only been a devops engineer for for very
little compared to a lot of people but
because I came from a startup
um I had to learn a lot and yeah
fortunate to have and still have uh
senior members on my team that have been
guiding me since the beginning and like
like you've seen the tools that I've
mentioned like I'm using tools that a
lot of people do not know about or have
seen yeah because we're doing a lot of
like cool stuff like again a lot of
security like I know a lot of devsecups
uh secops stuff that people don't know
um you know like one one of the tools
that I put on there I don't know if you
guys heard of Sops uh you can decrypt an
encrypt in place in the pipelines in the
automation so that way you don't have
secrets or uh stuff like that in your
code and you're nice
see that's that's what I love about like
working at you know small medium-sized
companies is if you're lucky like I know
there are you know horror stories too
but
um if you're like if your culture is
really good like because you set up a
lot of things you're wearing multiple
hats even though your rule might be just
devops engineer
um but that just builds like a really
good foundation when you want to ramp up
and you know move somewhere bigger yeah
in terms of uh devsecops like so on the
in the CI builds you can do a lot of
like static code analysis right so I'm
very familiar with like sonar Cloud nice
there's other stuff like armor box or
some or armor no idea what you guys
should talk about so yeah and all it is
it's it's basically it's just again uh
static uh code analysis
um you know it's not going to execute
the code and it's been a little longer
like you know uh code smells and things
like that and you can set up things so
that way developers are not submitting
code
uh that can cause a vulnerability or or
you know a misconfiguration and and
again you're doing the whole shifting
left right you're you're you're scanning
it and it gives them feedback right away
so that way you don't even touch it it
automatically pings them let them know
like hey hey Jesus is telling you that
your PR has these three code smells and
according to the gate that they place
you this cannot be submitted until you
fix this
yeah um I've I've heard about sonar
cloud and like the the sdks they provide
because you can just build right into
whether it's python they support a bunch
of language Gwen are you familiar with
code ql or the GitHub I've never I've
never used it though so yeah one of the
tasks that I do want to work on is have
code ql integrated into our pipelines in
learn to Cloud what it does is it's like
just you know it scans the code that
gets committed to any of the community
PR's and looks for vulnerability so
maybe there is a
python package that's out of date that
has security vulnerabilities that are
you know known to code ql so it'll let
you know that this PR cannot be merged
because it has this security
vulnerabilities which is good to have on
an open source project right um so that
is the idea of what sonar Cloud does it
runs in an action yes yeah okay and then
so that that covers like and you know if
we kind of switch and put on our
security hearts that covers the whole uh
called uh static what is it it's like S
I forget static code now like S C A or
something like that
which is dynamic application security
testing and I do that with uh zap and
what it does it it does like some kind
of uh
like uh what's the application security
testing while it's live so you give it a
URL and it will throw different types of
uh like test penetration tests you can
get very intricate with that and you can
put that in the CI build you put that in
the CD build
um
yeah it's it's a there's a lot of Cool
Tools um I also do a lot of uh uh
testing so I do help put in tests and CI
builds and the CD builds
I've been dabbling with the Azure load
testing preview
um and it's really awesome
um you know I I actually was working
with a lot of the QA Engineers to see if
this would fit uh some of the things
that they wanted and I mean it was a
great session we all learned a lot um
you could set that up by yourself but
you have to manage kubernetes and all
that and I'm pretty sure you know
one gear small devops team you don't
want to be managing stuff like that if
it's a self-managed service and you can
train people to do it
that's you know best case scenario
because you put the responsibility back
on the developer
yeah those are like some really good
like innovations that I've seen in like
the devops spaces because one of the
challenges we had back in 2018 19 ish is
we were trying to figure out how like we
had stating environments right but how
do we load test an app that has millions
of users in production but you can't
replicate that at a smaller scale where
you're just a startup and you don't have
even with like you know blue green or
rolling updates it's it's hard we only
had like four QA engineers and they're
like that's four users like how do we
load test this with the the actual
traffic that will hit so yeah I think
yeah that space is gonna grow a lot like
I've seen like sonar Cloud growing
um there's another one where
I think it's called Pangea Pangea Cloud
um they're doing something similar
um pretty interesting
but yeah yeah but yeah the plans for
Gwen I think this will integrate really
well with
um
the learn to Cloud CI part where maybe
Jesus can help us out with that I just
created an issue so yeah free yeah like
I'll take a look around the Discord like
I just never yeah yeah like most of the
time like a lot of the time that I like
followed your guys's content when it
first started like again I just wasn't I
was kind of busy learning how to do it
right
doing the stuff and watching us I like
that yeah I like that yeah
that's the mindset but now you can help
us yeah definitely absolutely we got
some questions here also first I want to
say shout out to Canal
yeah I saw that hey let's go what up if
you're still watching
uh I want to get your take on this here
what do you think about this here any
companies are expecting devops to write
code all day long while we do script
automate coding it's not the main focus
help spread the word and clear up so
this was some LinkedIn take I don't know
if you saw this uh no yeah I could
definitely give my insight so yeah
you know it's it's to me it's like if
you have one additional skill like
whether it's security if you are eat
because well let me backtrack so
devops Engineers from what I've seen we
all were you know from all walks of life
we have some people who are software
Engineers we have some people who are
security people or people like myself
right
um that being said we all bring our own
like you know experiences views and and
off the table right yeah so having
additional Tools in your belt makes you
that much better right whether you code
or don't code if you do know how to code
it helps because sometimes as a devops
engineer you're presented with
situations where nobody knows how to
implement something and they bring it to
you right so you got to go read up on
the documentation is there an SDK is
there an API is this a custom solution
um you know I've had to write a bunch of
serverless functions to to find
solutions to things that have not
existed so for example
um you know I'm not I've never been in
cyber security or anything well we had
to integrate a malar scanning tool
um you know I don't I didn't know
anything about it but because I learned
how to code I went learned the SDK
learned the API
figured out how to integrate that rotor
Services serverless function because of
the only solution they offered out of
the box for Azure was a VM and as we all
know VMS can be pricey so we wanted to
uh
so we went through serverless functions
container apps I'll get it deployed
trust me what language do you primarily
use as a devops uh so uh again bash uh
Python and then because of the different
types of apps that we support uh
majority are in Ruby and c-sharp and
then for my personal like side projects
I I do go and then
um python for for personal what's uh
what's your experience with with
learning Go versus python I feel like
those two get compared a lot
um especially in the devops space yeah
so
I will say
um go has really great error handling
um so I remember one of like my first
projects as a as like when I first
joined the team
um you know you a lot of people write
scripts and you know people who write
bash right very like procedural code
like step one step three right but they
don't do error handling or anything like
that so when a pipeline fails you don't
really know what's going on so I had to
write like my own little like package to
do error handling with go it's already
built in and that that that saves you a
lot of time because you can check right
then and there at the time and place uh
for the error
if um
if someone wanted to learn devops now
what would you recommend like just bash
and python
it oh man it just really depends on like
the industry and your company right like
that's just my experience right like
giving the people that I have I've had
on my team and and what we do but uh you
know for there yeah I would be I would
say bash and python
um
and and you know with with bash you can
that there's more things that you can
learn in bash that are open to make you
look more better devops engineer right
like those those tools that I would
suggesting yeah
get Ops JQ or yeah dot JQ
which is a uh uh like a pattern
replacement
uh tool that you can use and you can use
that a lot like it accepts yaml Json do
a lot of stuff like that so just
learning bash and python to start off
and then you can go off from there
um and with python the one thing you
know if if like say already somebody
already knew how to code with python I
would recommend
learning how to create serverless
functions
good take
because yeah you become that much better
because now you can build Solutions in
the cloud for your team and because your
devops engineer you're going to build
the whole CI pipeline the whole CD
pipeline The Continuous you know
process of all that so you can continue
to update it and then you can just pass
that back on to the engineers
I've got a question for you how was the
learning curve going from the knowledge
you had in bash and python to go like I
know it's just a
it's just not the syntax thing because
it's it's different on how it handles
certain things yeah
um
I mean I'm
I'm a very big believer because again I
don't have a bachelor's degree I don't
know I don't have a masters like you
know a fancy University or anything
right but yeah I'm a big believer in
YouTube University you know what I mean
you know things like that so my learning
curve wasn't that great like you know
steep or you know or however that goes
right I went on udemy I purchased the
course
burn through the course and again like
as you start to learn how to program
you you learn the structure of
programming right every language is
going to have different syntax and
you know it just really depends on how
bad you want it I mean I've burned
through that course like in a week
because I was like all right I'm trying
to build a solution and because I've
code I've you know I've coded and see
it was pretty quick per se you know the
syntax is pretty similar right but good
is your skill set with cyeah proficient
um but but again it's just I I see the
patterns in the in the programming
languages it's just learning the syntax
really so I can context switch pretty
quickly like I've like this week that's
impressive Ruby stuff never touched Ruby
before see Ruby go Python's yeah
impressive skill set there like but that
is that is the the trade-off there is uh
and and this is what I I struggle with
at times is like
you know the phrase uh what is it uh
jack of all trades or what is no not
that one yeah
the Jack of all trades master of none
master of none but still better than a
master of one yeah facts people forget
that last part and the people forget
that last part right
and and you know again my I'm you know
very t-shaped type of person where I
I've dabbled a little bit here and there
where I can you know learn some stuff
pick it up run with it right
but the thing that that people like that
like myself struggle with is that we're
not very in-depth in in into one
specific language so like if they talk
to me about like you know threading in
Python
um I probably have to go learn it I'll
pick it up but like I'm not too just
asked chat chat gbt right yeah someone
asked uh this is a good question here
the last part here your your ideal
asserts pathway for cloud devops let's
just say devops because cloud devops is
different there so if someone wanted to
come in and upskill in devops do you
have any search that you recommend
umI mean if if they have no knowledge of
of devops I mean certs can definitely
help and in my in my experience it's
like certs can get you you know based
knowledge but they're not a really good
like indicator of how successful you're
going to be it's really their HR filters
like they're it's just
a really good way to put it like what's
what's gonna get you like in the door
your foot in the door are your projects
can can you speak to you know
what a CI pipeline is like what what is
a devops for dinner to you like how you
know what what skill sets do you bring
to the table
um certs help and again like if they're
looking to like specialize in like one
thing like Azure right you know
definitely recommend like starting with
the AZ 900 again I don't have it um I
kind of just you know went through the
fire flames I didn't learned it on it's
the best way though yeah it's the best
way uh but yeah like if they're looking
like you know of course Azure 900 but
then in terms of like outside of certs
like that can build your general
knowledge CompTIA asserts are very very
useful just because it's uh you know
what is it vendor neutral knowledge
identify
um and you know that'll help you
anywhere right if you know networking
you can pick up networking in Azure you
can pick up networking and idws gcp
versus just being specialized in just
Azure right
yeah yeah no I think like so it's this
has been like a really long going debate
on both of our channels is
we get questions about hey what do which
should I do when I think Gwen nailed it
in her like previous videos that
and your response was really good
about you know how they're like a good
filter for HRS yeah how they're really
good if you're just starting out because
I think they're good
way to get like structured learning
because think of someone who is really
new
um they don't know where to start I
think so like let's say easy 900 or
Cloud practitioner kind of teaches you
like hey start here like learn what
cloud computing is the next thing would
be the pricing models the next thing is
this and this so there is a structure
way to learn which can get overwhelming
for someone who is just beginning yeah
so that structure is really good part of
it but if you just do the search for
like for just the passing sake
and like getting badges on LinkedIn yeah
yeah I'm definitely gonna create a video
because Gwen knows this I did 12 Subs in
11 months in a year
um and some of them are just sat and
like passed I didn't even have to study
but they didn't bring me anywhere like
not much value only two or three search
brought like the actual value to me
because I sat down and learned things
um yeah for devops give me a second I'm
just going to turn on the heater I'll be
back it's a big call where I'm at
yeah for devops yeah you just gotta like
even in Cloud it's just gonna be like
get Hands-On get packs your hands dirty
and come learn to Cloud uh we have a lot
of issues open
we have good amount of documentation
we have some devops tasks though could
they we have some devops tasks yeah and
it'll be nice because look at the
traffic look at the numbers we shared uh
it will be nice to put on your resume
that you submitted to three PRS to yeah
Cloud yeah I've been looking to to like
again give back to the community or like
you know help other people
to you know break into Tech because it's
hard it's I mean I'm gonna be honest
it's hard especially like if yeah you
don't have those connects right like if
you didn't go to a prestigious
University that has all those events for
you the networking the people right it's
kind of hard to just kind of show up and
hey you know you guys hiring
like they don't know who you are
um and yeah so definitely I'm always
looking to help do you so this person
asks what's your info on Discord can you
be my mentor do you do mentorships I
don't know if that's um I mean I I have
uh I work with two interns that we have
that really they're really great um I'm
I don't know if I could be a mentor I
mean I'm still learning myself yeah but
I could definitely you know help answer
questions you know when if when when
available right you you got a Twitter or
something like what like what what's the
best one LinkedIn like I I have I'm
working on my LinkedIn and I was
actually even thinking about uh because
I remember I started seeing some of your
content on Tick Tock and I was actually
yeah and you know I was like I was like
maybe I should post but most of it is uh
you know I do I'm I'm part of a Discord
server that uh is for students of the
local Community College where I'm from I
do I do a lot of help through there with
like other students or
um you know people that just need
General help with with if we're doing
the same sir or or class
got it got it so
um what I'm gonna do later is in the
description of this video
um like at the minute that you come in
I'm gonna drop like I don't know some
kind of link that you would be like the
best way to reach you like you can give
it to me on Discord because we're we're
on Discord now
um we're gonna have someone else on so
it was great having you yeah I would
love to have you on another time like to
talk a little bit more about oh I
personally have more interest in knowing
about like like the military experience
what would the transition like like all
that kind of stuff because I feel like
those stories in Tech aren't shared that
much but I feel like we need to dedicate
a whole session to that yeah
um but yeah I'll be in touch with you
and I really appreciate you hopping on
like out of nowhere
we'll talk to you soon all right take
care bye cheersthat was awesome we gotta get that
awesome yeah we have a another guest
that we want to come on I I wish we
could have kept talking but
um
did you get a link
yeah I have a feeling people are gonna
know this this dude
we're all still learning learn to do it
teach it facts
uh this this doesn't work
what yeah I deleted it I don't know why
it's still showing
um
hello
what country are you in now hello
I'm in London nice
for like what a day until you travel
again or like two weeks I'm going to U.S
this one
what part are you coming to New York
I am going to be in New York yeah
you gotta you gotta meet him come on
yeah
I'll be in Florida then New York like a
week and then L.A
all right La nice so there's an event
there I'm speaking at yeahwhen is thatseventh and eight right canal yeah
seventh and eighth oh February or
February they're running a conference
yeah it's in Temple how big is the
conference like well how many attendees
expecting it uh around you know
1000 and we have Steve Wozniak coming inall right wait for I feel like you came
in and we didn't even introduce you some
people most people probably already know
you but this is Kunal devops go if you
go on YouTube just try probably type in
just Kunal he'd probably come up there
um I've never spoken to you I think
we've spoken maybe on DM but I haven't
spoken to you on like voice face chat
anything you and rishab kind of know
each other right
yeah we we met at hackcon in per like we
have been I've known him from YouTube
and Twitter and all of the social
networks but then I met him in person uh
we went out on dinner and played some
bar games and stuff really
um at hack on yeah it was it was fun
time good event yeah
very cool right after the week I saw you
going when I was at your place
oh that was this summer yeah yeah
wow my camera looks so
bad compared to yours what camera do you
use it's I I use the this is the good
one
but that looks nice and crispy it's it's
running out of battery so you have a
dummy battery power
what what camera do what's the good one
which one is it
that's the a6400 nice that's the one you
have for sure
no yeah mine is 50 yeah 5100
I think so
nice same thingI can't tell the difference between life
this and full-frame cameras and Eddie
has like really big heavy one Kai can't
tell the difference I probably like mine
my thing like The Lens comes out like so
it's like right there it's like so bad I
don't know how the arm thingy is holding
it I feel like it's gonna like come
apart in a little bit but
yeah Canal what certifications so people
get if they want to get into devops well
actually how do you what do you think
about certifications I don't know your
opinion yeah I don't have any
do you think they're a waste of time no
I think um
I'll tell the truth no I don't think I
don't think it's mandatory
um
and it's just not just me I I spoke to
like a lot of people and this is guys
you know I work with Siam he has a lot
of like he has like every equivalent
certification and he himself told me
like that you know it's not really
mandatory uh sometimes like there are
job requirements you know let's say you
have to have AWS certifications because
AWS is very complex soI know
um hot takes yeah it is fun I don't know
you don't have you don't have any
certifications not even expired ones
uh no I don't have any wait did you go
to college I don't know I don't know a
lot I graduated yeah from what what
degree camera signs
um still waiting and this isn't the guy
who used to work uh look at you while he
was a a VP he worked at Microsoft as
well and he also had like
so I asked him why he's like just you
know
I don't know
but I I I don't on the other hand I know
people who have a lot of certifications
and
in the end I think it's just about if
the job requires it or whatever I'll
think I think like certifications
provide like for some people like a
structured roadmap that helps everyone
learns differently
um so if you need that structured
roadmap that feeling of accomplishment
yeah you can do some nice certifications
yeah yeah I don't think it's mandatory
I'd be in trouble if it wasyeah that's that's how I feel and I know
going YouTube because remember like we
were talking about this on like when you
did your CDA like the certified
developer associate like
the and it was not for just getting the
certificate like our real purpose was to
learn this new technology to learn cloud
and like have a structured path because
there was not a lot of content that was
available at the time and not a lot of
guidance that was available for free
and like I'm glad I did those
certificates like no regrets but then
the purpose shouldn't be just getting a
new badge to like showing your signature
or show on your resume
um because those get like caught so
easily in in an interview
um and yeah I feel like people miss the
purpose of why you need to get
certificate and that's also the reason I
hate content that says get Solutions
architect and own six figure salary like
that's not the reality I get it it gets
great numbers it get people's hopes high
but you need to show the reality that
there is a lot of hard work that's so
good to go in yeah yeah clickbait
content I just remember I have one but I
it's so irrelevant I forgot about it
well you have a video like that no no no
no no no oh I was like I was like wait
whatit's a Google Cloud associate Cloud
engineer nice
because I don't even remember when I got
it
20 20. that wasn't too long ago okay
yeah three years agooh someone says the dod sector requires
base level certificate like so the
government yeah but who wants to work
for the governmentI know guysjust kidding just kidding I know some
people enjoy it I yeah personally
wouldn't but
that's fine what are the hot takes Kunal
you always have hot takes come on there
is this Friday afternoon
I don't know what I just I I just share
like what's already out there some
people don't like it yeah that's why
that's that's why yeah yeah we'll
consider it as a hot take and like
yeah no we're talking about layoffs you
tell me like how how's it going I'm not
much like I haven't really checked I
just saw some news like Google laid off
12 000. yeah so like in total this week
I think we lost
30 what 30 to 40 000 engineers
just in big Tech then we I don't know
what the other the other ones yeah
that's a good amount of Engineerstech people yeah I should rephrase it
yeah yeah tech people that we lost
why do you think that is happening we've
got too much hiding during koi
yeah yeah definitely
um I have that personal opinion I think
I shared it during the start of the
stream is I know a lot of companies are
saying that but I also saw that
happening there was too much hiring
um pre-covered too like in 2019 I I knew
like how much hiring was going on for
each like role they were like you know
500 2
000 people lined up for interviews not
applying lined up and like
that's that is a really big number
um for
just a year and then once I got into
Google I don't I won't share anything
that's like in my end here or stuff but
I I could see like how the hiring
process is and how much
like fast they were increasing the the
count
the head count
um
and with the recession I think it just
made it worse like
the the the thought okay now we have to
like lose some numbers
um we had really rapidly in
now we don't have uh like we just have
to be safe for the future right so
yeah
to be honest that's what I think yeah
Microsoft the CEO said we want to do
people should want to do
like they're looking to do more with
less
um
which I think is
yeah understandable
it's a business you know yeah business
is business
cost cost efficiency is going to be
really really important for this year
especially with Cloud yeah
I'm going to keep on I saw like four
startups that were just doing like
cosmosis yeah it's a big thing I heard
about it he's a good question
technical skills becoming obsolete by
automation future will be more focused
on Vision ideas and implementation
what do you guys think
I think
yeah definitely like Char gbt will
uh
replace some stuff
I definitely think so not just in Tech
but like uh my you know my colleague
told me about this lawyer he met
uh not a lawyer like a person he met who
works with lawyers and he was like you
know what like you know you don't know
what this chat gbt thing you know it'll
be like lawyers will be replaced real
estate stuff will be replaced and he was
like very aggressive about it
um
but yeah I think it's interesting like
imagine you know lawyers being replaced
with child gbt but the other thing is
like would you trust her you know charge
equity for your legal stuff uh it's an
interesting question and then how do you
make up for it like all these jobs being
replaced like you know if you talk about
for example content content writers
right uh if you want to gonna get some
piece written and you just can either
give it to one person and pay them and
then they will give it to you after a
few hours or you can just give it to
like a chat GPT like tool and um it can
do it for you
so obviously people would prefer the
chat CPT one because everyone wants you
know that efficiency and if it if it can
get the job done people will you know
prefer it the real question is can you
really tell that if it's you know
written by a a an AI or a person if we
reach that level where you can't tell
I don't know and I would use it but then
the question arises what do we do like
to replace these jobs which is new jobs
being created or whatever
um I don't know maybe maybe not in five
years maybe not in 10 years maybe not in
20 years but in 30 years come on like
it's coming I think it's called yeah I
have
sorry go ahead it's not the first time
this has happened in the world like
think about when we used to use horses
and then the car came along like I'm
sure people who used to
I was about to drive the horse like ride
the horse they were like oh what am I
going to do with my job and then they
found something else to do right like
we've as a society or I guess as
Humanity we figure these things out but
AI is like completely different than you
know a horse so in a car so there's that
too
servos and then kubernetes came along
people like we'll use our job to Gates
automation but it's created you know
more jobs more certificatesI think it's also the about like it's
it's also the thing about adoption like
if how rapid is the adoption to how
rapid is people utilizing that tool in
their lives
the reason why I say that because I have
a I have a bit of an observation
about
because it was being used at
um The Institute that I teach at
so it's already seeing like chat GPT
like being used to write essays and to
write assignments
um to write
uh
which is fine because at the end of the
day it's a tool right but then there's
a thing about you know plagiarism
there's things about like who gets the
credit of
um this piece if it's written by a
student or does it Con like would you
consider it cheating because now they
didn't
like you can still consider it research
but
like if they really don't understand the
underlying
article that they read and the copied
like what's the point of you know having
um
like these assessments
but then again I know that people will
come at me and say like education is
already very behind like we shouldn't
have treason papers right
I alone cannot change that
and I don't like I don't have the power
to change it it's like a really big uh
you know organization and it like you
need several
um bills that needs to be passed before
Um this can be changed and chat GPT can
be included as a tool rather than a
cheating material
um but yeah I I really think it will
depend on adoption and the efficiency
and like just what Canal said about like
how great at it like how great it will
be at writing stuff or creating stuffthe most
immediate opportunity is to become
efficient at asking chat yes questions
so you can get a more efficient answer
so if you can utilize it then utilize it
to your favorite because it's not going
away no it is not
it's it's like those things you have
seen those videos where the like I've
seen few you know where they're they're
really Advanced users who know how to
use Google like with kiwis and stuff
yeah
so they have just you know gained an
expertise on like using their Curie
language that Google uses and they get
really good and streamlined results and
same thing is with chat gbt like if you
can get the answer you want
um yeah
is talking to someone who used to work
at Google AI and then you told me that
um
what Google has in comparison to charge
GPT it's much much stronger where is it
yeah it's like I can't I I even I don't
know it's internal stuff yeah they're
gonna kill it after three months though
just like stadia and all that kind of
stuffthat's a hot take that reminds me of a
page they have like Yeah by Google right
yeah something like that guys
I keep hearing platform engineering what
the hell is platform engineering I keep
hearing that it's going to take over
devops but I'm too lazy to Google what
it isI think it's only going to just rename
fancy stuff you know I think it's only
I think it's only like
like the next phase but basically
encouraging more of what devops is so in
terms of like you know uh you you you
talk about the so in the software
development life cycle we have the you
know deployments and the monitoring
stuff and the continuous feedback and
then management and you use Automation
and stuff and that's what basically you
know devops stuff and platform
engineering is about you take these
processes and the best practices and
it's basically it is you're using the
the devops burnout this thing devops
burnout
um and using these you know the things
that I just mentioned about deployment
management monitoring you know these
tools and the processes and all the best
practices so you make this into like a
like a service
then you can use it across various teams
in your organization like various
engineering teams for various use cases
so initially so basically the idea is to
reduce the burnout that folks may be
having with devops
um
and even with devops we talk about many
people have their own like you know
terms like some people say okay they're
off to engineer some people say I have
no idea what a devops engineer is devops
is not a title so
I I get it like it's fine you can get
into jargon but um I I don't think it
will take over I think it's only if
something is
formed out of like enhancing a
particular thing it's not like taking
over it it's just it's just
yeah it's elevating it a little bit
um
yeah
yeah I think yeah you're the previous
debate I saw people doing was like SRE
versus devops but then people realized
that it's two different things
um but yeah to be honest I remember
being Cloud engineer and still doing
devops things even though my title
didn't say that
so at the end of the day it's just how
you want to Define it and how companies
want to define a certain rule even
though you might be doing same things
that
um
someone at company X is doing as a
platform engineer and you are doing that
as a devops engineer at company yEP taking a more
productization View
Ed I'm not gonna lie I still don't get
the difference
like I feel like it's just like a
buzzword or like it's over complicating
or like I feel like there's not a need
for it but then again I'm not very
versed in the devops space in general so
I'm still like I don't know maybe I'll
Google it later or something probably
won't
wait what does it say here hold on a
platform engineer will create the
program do all the cicd do all the SRE
work and devs so you're literally trying
to get one person to do everything this
sounds like they're trying to save money
versus over here having to consult with
a devops engineer about how to take this
to the cloud than needing and necessary
to set up monitoringsorry yeah I was the devops engineer I
did set up
rapid seven data dog
um pager Duty and I was one I was the
one who was being paged I was no SRE
um so like platform engineer that's why
um
we figured it out
they took advantage of started it this
sounds like they're trying to get a
whole team with one new run they just
created a new role like oh and then
they're they're pushing it it's a
conspiracy they're pushing it to replace
platform yeah Icarus wizard it equals
like rocks you know how they call it
like 10x developers 100x developers yeahyeah I'm a 1X
no no that there was a nice quote by
Kelsey oh no we haven't heard
so it said that uh 10x developer is not
uh someone who works 10x harder it's who
makes 10 other Engineers you knowbetter okay okay okay that's a nice spin
to it
hold on here's a good one coming from it
managed services do you think SRE would
be an easier environment to adopt since
you're coming from infrastructure
management
what what's the question here coming
from it managed services do you think
SRE would be easier environment adopt
since you're like to get into that role
I don't understand yeah I can tell you
this it can get stressful for some
um I remember receiving an alert at 2AM
3am and I've talked about it several
times on the podcast I've done with
Grant and streams
um like I my sleep is terrible now
because I get up to like the lightest
noise because that's how my brain is
wired for being on call for three years
so
yeah it can get stressful and I told you
when towards the end I was like on call
every alternate week so it is not fun
especially if you have too many outages
uh but then again it's your duty to make
your infrastructure more reliable and
available
um so yeah
if you're fine with getting up at 3M
looking at Linux server in the command
line and going through logs and figuring
out what's going on while you sip your
coffee that's fine but I find it really
hard if you have family and stuff
um to like have that kind of
responsibility so I don't miss my
on-call days but I learned a lotThe Villages an example of platform
engineering you're creating a
self-service automated solution
but even that product is not pitched as
platform engineering I'm gonna maybe
they should I'm gonna go hit up Savannah
this is product lead like hey you're
missing out on some buzzwords here you
should slap platform engineering on that
and you're good it's just pitched us a
developer tool really yeah oh I think I
might I could be wrong I haven't checked
their marketing stuff lately
hi can we convert terraform
configuration to a diagram I don't know
yeah use the data from graph command
s chat GPT it probably knows how to do
it for you
that is so bad for your health oh the
sleep yeah umwhat what else is here it really depends
uh hold on
the other day someone told us that they
were trying to hire remember rishab they
were trying to hire a cloud engineer
with oh yeah to 20 something years of
experience
that was crazy
freaking crazy
thank you guyswhat would you accept as a salary if you
had 20 years of experienceum I don't know ask me in 20 years come
on man we can't get anything out of you
yeah it's like sipping his water in
super chill he's like no I'm not getting
into these baits
yeah because they're gonna clip it
they're gonna clip it's gonna go viral
on Twitter I think until I was gonna
because I was gonna get canceled 20
years
I don't know if money would still be
there in 20 years okay how many Bitcoin
will you accept
now he'll say well it depends on the
value of Bitcoin in 20 years we'll see
in 20 years right
the the only reason I asked is because
yeah as Gwen was saying we saw like some
chatter in our Discord Channel like a
company trying too hard like a mid-level
or senior level
Cloud engineer with 20 years of
experience and the pay range was like
not great I think
or something so that's why like I was
just trying to get your opinion
yeah I know people who like
umthis guy he got offered 450k at Amazon
to lead their Europe region
450k base yeah 450k he was going to lead
yeah I feel like that's kind of low
yeah to lead a team perfect team or
something yeah
how many years of experience did this
person have
quite a lot yeahthere's a lot of money
there there is and that's why like I
think Gwen said it's less
um because you can never feel like yeah
yeah no not saying that we like would
like I don't even imagine what I would
do if I own that amount of money but
the reason why I said that is I've seen
data that there are like some especially
like if you see staff level or you know
principal level Engineers who are
earning
550k to like 600k and they're not
leading a team they're just like
individual contributors right so that's
why I was like if he's leading like a
few like a whole like you know
engineering department and it's it's a
more tedious work I guess what I'm
trying to say
it's not for Canada or sorry yeah
strictly U.S strictly U.S how are Europethat's that's uh setting pound or
something
uh yeah
450 I guess in Europe is significant
significant and it's also significant
not only in Europe because you know
against like us I believe is kind of
expensive in certain terms right well I
know yes specifically
Europe are less in general than the US
yeah so
do you recommend Discord and why
do you guys recommend Discord
is discard sponsoring us
I'm just kidding yeah we do recommend
this code that's why like our
communities are in this code
I like how this is free
on slack you have to like pay inside
yeah for like history and things
whatyou no longer need to get into
management to get more money is Kunal
are you a manager are you I'm a messy
yeah wow
how do you feel about that do you like
it
it's good too much uh
I'm trying to travel less
um
but overall it's good I'm doing a bunch
of things because we are like a small
team which is what I like uh get to do
everything uh how big is the whole
company
like 40 people
um so like multiple hats it's good
um especially I graduated last year so I
have the freedom to like experiment
build my profiles Gloria lore
um especially if you graduated last year
that that thing is what amazing wait so
what you're like what 20 years old
something like that yeah
so see that is what like amuses me every
time is like you met me at hack on he's
like
I lead the devil team at sibo and I'm
like didn't you just tweet that you were
going to graduate in like October or
something I was like yeah
I'm like an eel after
becoming one
so you were working in your third year I
was a student for more than a year how
did you get that job as a student I
started as an intern uh
in my and like in my third year or
something
and then I
um
so I I got uh I got one at Google
it didn't depending and then they sort
of like revoked the offer because of uh
coed
um so I got one at c1n and then um
yeah I started small like as an intern
and then after two three months uh Mark
was like doing good give him gave me
some more stuff to do
um and then uh one year went by then he
was like you can you should join full
time and join full-time
um in September last year
so it works for like 1.5 years what time
ish or something while I was a studenthow did you manage yeah I just didn't go
to universitybut I don't recommend doing that if
you're if your University is nice then
um and make the most out of it was yours
not nice mine was not good so I didn't
go I just went to like give exams and
get the degree but I didn't really
attend lectures or anything because it
was finally
finally got a hot take out of him yeahI'm not saying it worked Gwen it worked
it's not every University is not today
it's just like it's just weird like
we don't get together okay then just
don't go there definitely yeah I'm a bit
familiar with and that's that's the
that's the primary reason you know I ran
or not ran I moved to Canada
um after my like ran away I ran away I'm
like
if it's not good qualities like you know
I'm gonna spend the same amount of money
on my education in India which
might suckum some like better spend the same
amount of money where I can at least you
know
have good career opportunities which I
guess I'm doing better than I would have
been so
in India if you if you don't go to a top
school
you're like you have like little chance
of Landing a job I think you need to
work hard like you need to
yeah yeah like you like Canal is a great
example I guess in that case like he's a
perfect story here
um that you need to be
you need to get out of your comfort zone
go out and create opportunities for
yourself
even study at certain points by yourselfis it expensive
umI don't think so compared to the states
it's not very my my entire University is
a private one but funded by government
um I mean there's one main University
and then mine it has multiple colleges
in it colleges in it so it's pretty
average stuff uh it was like
wait I'm doing a conversion ofit's like four thousand pounds for four
years
okay yeah it's not yeah that's like
like you can't even get a year here yeah
I was gonna say that's like a semester
and the Very premium colleges in India
if you want to go to like premium
premium ones
um
20 000 pounds for the entire year but
compared to what people make there is it
expensive uh
I would say it's yeah it's a relative
relatively okay yeah like people in U.S
make a lot more money and that's why I
think the but tuitions are still really
high and that's why I think it's hard
for
like us as International students to
move to us and that's why like I chose
Canada and also like a college instead
of a four-year degree
which can be really expensive if you
consider you know the household income
is in Indian rupees yeah
India is the only country one of the one
of the countries where the term
degree is not mandatory it does not
apply you need one
yeah really yeahin the U.S you don't need a degree if
you want to get a tech job
your skills and network and everything
India you need one
it's like
it's like any other I would say Asian
country Canal like that's my
understanding of it
like you know if you see
China or South Korea
um like you need like I've heard people
say that yeah you in in any profession
you need a degree you need four years of
college education too
pursue a career
um whereas I see that it's changing it's
a lot different in the west right
not okay not doctor and like accounting
stuff I know they that those professions
still need degrees but in Tech it's a
different thing
um but yeah and also I think when it's
like really a household thing too in
India like
it's like written down like okay it's
like you do high school high school yeah
you're gonna go to college like pick
what you want to do
oh so the option to not go is not even
it's not even an option like you you you
have to go like the option is what do
you want to go for it's a it's a norm I
would say yeah
um I won't say there are not Exceptions
there are definitely exceptions but
in a normal
yeah it's very rare that your family
would allow you not to go to college
here either so there are two reasons why
you would not go to a college in India
for like after a university for
engineers either your family is very
rich or your family is very poor
I think that's a really good video wow
that's a tweet right there
yeah so that's there are two reasons
yeah
we don't have any like football
scholarships like no one cares oh yeah
we don't have any extra calligraphy like
the national level player they don't
care really yeah you won't get
scholarships you okay
just a like bit more context on that you
can be
in government jobs like you will be
given preference if you're a national
level player or like you're good in some
kind of sports you can get government
jobs easily but education wise no
and government jobs are good it's all
right it's stable but it doesn't have
like a very good
I don't know
um
image
people want it it's it's like because
they never get fired with condoms even
if they don't do their jobs that's why
government banks are very like slow and
everything you know because people just
don't care
um
so that's why most people are like in
the like rural areas or whatever they're
like we want government job because you
know the stability and perks you know
you get the perks for government jobs
pension and
free like you know house quarters and
yeah all the benefits Essentials you get
umbut um
yeah it's just like the bare minimum
yeah yeah it's not exciting like it's I
think it's same here too yeah
here too the government is boring but
stable
yeah Davis yeah very stable you won't
see like rapid growth in your career too
like it'll be slow growth but it's
stable no kubernetes in the government
no platform Engineering in the
government
they still call it tech consultants yeah
like no way you're on like I said you're
on C sharp one done it framework
whatever the first one was no golang no
rust none of that kind of stuff
wait I didn't share about this stream
let me do that from
come on yeah get us get us to like your
numbers make us famous like youwait someone asked what role was Moe's
hit by the layoffs
recruiters
someone commented that toowell yeah because they'd obviously they
don't want to hire as much so I guess
that makes the most senseumyeah give us some fast kuna famous as a
service
[Laughter]
how do you like London how long have you
been there now
uh I moved on 7th Jan where I was I was
traveling before then uh quite a lot so
it's good it's very nice lots of things
to do
um it's one thing people say it's
expensive
I think
it's a very important it's cheaper to
compare like compared to India it's
cheaper that's a very controversial
opinion I'll explain why I understand
that expensive right I understand that
um
the energy bill is expensive water bill
is expensive I get that that's fine but
the tax is low
right houses are cheaper as compared to
India compared to compared to the money
you are making here
compared to India as well if like if you
want to buy a villa
I see that in India is like in Delhi
where I live let's say GK greater
kailash is a very popular area yeah you
want to buy a villa over there it's 100
crores easily same thing if I look
around London it's just like 10 crores
one day yeah I checked the prices and
everything
one more thing is the cars in India get
a lot of import Duty so because you get
really cheap uh the same model of a car
if you're getting in India for two
hundred thousand dollars the same you
can get in UK for ninety thousand same
exact configuration
especially like if you're into luxury
cars they're really cheap when you
compare it even though like groceries
are expensive and everything uh
I I still think it's it's nice it's it's
a for the long term if you're gonna buy
a house and one main thing is like the
weather is very nice like no pollution
air pollution still like India a lot I
love India but I think
for me it's not I'm like I'm not like
bound to UK If I miss India I'll just
book a flight and I'll go tomorrow my
work is completely
um so there's there's no I I'm not
bounded to a country uh I can go
anywhere I want did you move did you
move forward
yeah I I moved to like uh I'm gonna work
more closely with the team because I I
really even though I promote remote work
I really like the hybrid culture
and uh yeah I wanted to work more
closely with the you knowum and I wanted to go to uh so I was I'm
going to travel a lot during like a few
years and London is just like the right
spot Europe all the countries are near
the flights are not too long us is near
so if I'm traveling every month
it's from India doing that it's it's too
much yeah yeah travel time yeah yeah
isn't it like from New York isn't it
like what 12 hours or something or more
to London no no no India 14 or 15 hours
16 74 14 15 hours yeah
that's what I'm doing in September
from Toronto to like Delhi it's
I always hate it but you know you have
to do it that's really smart too like
yeah I think if you if you thought of
that already that you're gonna travel
and like you chose London like that's
like right in the middle of the East and
the West I guess
I had the option for you else but I I
don't like the laws
what loss just like immigration laws
it's very tiring like getting a Visa and
then you know
um getting a permanent residency permit
very very too much wait times and
um
that the lottery system or whatever yeah
something I didn't want to do is
London well I guess the UK better yeah
very easy with immigration so easy got
my Visa in five days uh you can get a
permanent like residency permit if not
you if you don't want citizenship you
can get permanent residency permit very
simple
very super easy yeah how about Canada
like what's your take on Canada it's too
cold
I know that Gwen
uh with Canada uh
I I didn't I did no research but I know
Canadians are nicest people on earth
see
you gotta represent
um I'm at Marino uh I was in Canada I
met Andrew and Tara from battle snake
metricia
so you you can tell a Canadian and you
really know you see a Canadian you'll
know they're from Canada
because of how they talk and how kind
they are
I I think I heard you say that you don't
like New York
yeah
um
no I like New York
you want to live here though
I I think living in New York is a
different thing and you know visiting is
a different thing I wouldn't know what
it's like to live until I've lived there
um but um from what I did like with my
visits it's it's okay but
yeah it's uh it's too many blocksyeah
I remember walking no the New York is
great uh I enjoy every time I come but
um
yeah just I it's not it's I'm neutral so
it's not you know like you visit New
York and you're like oh my God New York
City wish I could you know live there or
whatever I didn't feel that I was like
okay not even the first time yeah very
good no not even the first time okay New
York very nice good food great people
very good very good uh but I didn't get
the urge to like Okay so let's move here
but it doesn't mean it's not good it
just means that it's uh I'm not the New
York type maybe yeah but I really love
it because if I didn't then I wouldn't
you know visit again and again visiting
again
um
yeah
but the one the thing would use me I
think it's it's more about people than
the place you know and uh I think that's
what it is
yeah maybe maybe one day I'll come for a
monthin the summer you gotta come like June
is the perfect perfect month to be in
New York perfect weather July is all
right but like the lit the last half of
July and then August is too hot too
you should be a politicianuh the same I mean I I was there in uh
November
and now I'm gonna and then I was there
when was hackcon whenever hakon was and
then I was I'm gonna come in like
I want to see New York snow I want to
come to no snow yet yeah no there's
still snow there no it hasn't snowed at
all
what what
okay hasn't snowed yet you can come to
Canada go to Canada for like
from what the member to like
February or March and you'll see see
snow so there's a lot of time you can
seek snow
yeah it was like super sunny here today
it was warm like it's snowed in London
after two years
yeah
I was going to ask like how do you
because I know it was it was not a big
challenge for me because you know I was
just
like a 17 year old so I could eat fast
food a lot at that time but like how do
you deal with like Indian food
now I'm cooking myself nice
yeah that's the only way that's how I
learned this I started cooking myself
and London has incredible Indian
restaurants nice yeah some are better
than India
so good another controversial thing but
it's true
I gotta visit London yeah dishoom I had
pav bhaji there I was
so good and I had a Dosa near my like
this is just like a is an Indian family
they have a dosa restaurant
it's like a local second best dose I
have had what what is a a dosa
um it's like uh you know how you had
none with me yeah
it's a really thin version of it but
it's also not wheat so it's like right
it's really healthy for you but it's
also really lightweight like it's really
thin it's like like a tin pancakepotatoes and then yeah
very goodNew York dosa so
a DOTA man of New York
is very popular I'll have to try the
thing with me is like I can't handle
spicy food so it's not it's not so
you'll also get like a coconut chutney
thing it's like
that's really good for like soothing
your
you know gut and stuff
so it's it's the opposite of
what we tried Gwen
so Kunal I made her try like the
traditional Punjabi Cuisine you know you
have your Dal you have your butter
chicken and chicken and for that like
for her it was a bit spicy
um
and it was also was like a lot of
quantity I guess we were not able to
finish it yeah we had a couple of things
we thought they were going to be smaller
but they gave us good portions yeah and
how easy it a lot
keep that in white
the one thing with the UK is that some
restaurants uh make the food based on
the taste of like britishers it's not a
big Indian food and um it for someone
who is from India it would just taste
like really
different and not very good mediocre
yeah but yeah that was authentic
restaurants
that was true for like
some of the restaurants that I visited
early on here in Canada too it's like
really
um
you know for Canadians so that they can
consume it and then now I think I have
found some good places that are like
really authentic and like the good thing
is the ones that are good are usually
like local restaurants there no not
chains and stuff they're like a
family-run restaurants they cook
themselves and you know it just reminds
me of my home
butter chicken was considered more a
dessert in India not true
it is considered sweet
but it is not considered a dessert like
it's a main course dish at least what I
know of
yeah it's main course yeahhere says
intake butter chicken pizza
yep we have that here too it's good you
gotta try itleave it to the U.S to make or North
America to make anything Pizza wait what
is this
yeah that's also like a paneer dish
just like we had butter chicken there's
butter paneer but then
there's also sharpeni it's again like
previous cottage cheeseit's like tofu
yeah it's like alternative to meat in
India
I see I see oh yeah that's right because
wait but you come on do you eat meat
because I Know Rich of you dude no Canal
doesn't yeah okay I do you do yeah yeah
I remember that but Canal doesn't do the
majority of people in India don't yeah I
would say soum well I'll come back to this statement
um in North
and in like South
but in the mid I think there are a lot
more people who don't eat meat but yeah
North and South I think people eat a
good amount of meat like also in South I
think people are good with red meat like
beef uh and a lot of seafood
and in North it's majority chicken
but like I have in my family no not is
also like uh
like the cold region so yeah we meet
stuff over there in the in the west if
you go to like Gujarat and stuff there
people don't eat meat no yes like in the
midwest yeah if you go to West Bengal
and you go to Mumbai Goa and stuff yes
people eat a lot
um I think majority people do yeah
yeah
there's lots of people in my family do
but then there are also exceptions that
don't
is it a food blog yes
today on Fridays we talk about food
how are we going to afford all this
delicious food without jobs are you
worried about getting laid off no no
really
no
is it just because you're confident in
your skill set or is just something you
don't care about
um
I I
um so there's multiple things
I haveI really
so this the one thing is like I really
trust the people I work with because we
know you know what we're doing and
everything
um but even though if there's let's say
a one percent chance I know that you
know I'll find another job okay it's all
about staying relevant
um someone was asking me how do we
prevent to get laid off well you can't
you know you can't prevent because there
was this one guy worked 16 years at
Google got laid off without a reason he
made a tweet 15 years it's a lot of yeah
yeah
so I I don't think you can prevent to
get laid off if you're getting laid off
your company has made up their mind yeah
they will they will you know just fire
you but the good thing is if you just if
you're relevant you have a good
connection of you know Network people
have the skills and you'll find another
job and I know I have the skills and
I'll find another job
um that's why I'm not worried and I
think
I I it's not just about laying off I I
never worry about anything in lifeyou can't name one single thing that I
would be worried about
really nothing yeah yeah because I think
it will be ironic because
you're earning the earning you know all
uh nice and you know comfortable living
and then you're you know
um
you you work so hard you know in
University and uh even after you know
doing all the work and the hard work and
the you know getting a nice job and you
know being able to afford you know food
and all the things and traveling the
world even after all of these things I
am worried about stuff then
you know better than the
like folks who can't make decisions you
know like like animals for example
animals don't have the ability to like
make decisions but we are humans we have
the ability to make decisions so even
after having all of these things and you
know what's the point of so much hard
work if in the end I'm still worried
about
anything in my life right I've worked
too much I work too hard to worry about
things like that's basically my way of
putting it another point is that I don't
worry about things that are out of my
control
which is something that most people
worry about so if you stop worrying
about things that are out of your
control you yourself will realize that
you are not worried about anything
because people mostly they worry about
things that are out of their control
because you can't do anything about it
you know so example when I was giving my
interviews right so there's let's say
it's a good example let's say we take
two people as uh
um hypothetical people
um so we take John Wick and Spider-Man
so John Wayne and Spider-Man they're
they're like applying to a job right and
then they're preparing for the job and
John Wick is like spending 100 of his
time preparing for interview right he's
doing lead code and you know projects
and just studying and Spider-Man what
Spider-Man is doing is he's spending 50
of the time uh
studying and preparing for the interview
and he's spending the rest of the 50
worrying about the outcome like okay
what what would happen what what would I
do if I don't get the job and you know
all these other things so now if we
imagine that both of them are on the
same level in terms of like mentality
and who's going to get the who's going
to prepare and who's gonna who's gonna
give a better interview it's going John
Wick right
so
even if you want to worry about like
there's obviously some things that are
inevitable that you get to worry about
but
if you don't worry about things out of
your control then I I I just never worry
yeah that's a great way to end the
stream with some positive deep
philosophical knowledge we've been doing
this for like almost three hours so I
gotta go take a break Canal we gotta do
this again it's nice to chat with you
you're filled with knowledge at such a
young age
uh but all right everyoneum oh yeah it was it was great to have
you Canal um yeah we're gonna do this
like as a dedicated thing I know it was
all random but yeah that's how we do
this
as always it's in New York uh when
you're in New York yeah yeah maybe I'll
be there and Russia will see you in
Canada yeah sorry about Florida first
Florida first Canada as well yep
definitely
all right bye everyone
