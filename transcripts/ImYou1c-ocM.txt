I was in a cloud engineering interview a
couple years ago I remember being so
embarrassed because I felt like this is
a concept I should have understood
before going into the interview but I
really didn't I was asked to explain the
difference between scalability and
elasticity and if I could diagram it out
or anyway to visually represent it and I
couldn't I remember answering it just
saying a whole bunch of like buzzwords
or something like that and I remember at
the end of my answer I just thought to
myself oh boy there's no way I'm getting
this job I didn't get the job so yeah
now with a couple of years experience
since then let me explain it to y'all in
case you ever find yourselves in this
situation right so let's switch over to
the screen on my left side we're gonna
display scalability on the right side
we're going to display elasticity and
I'm gonna show on my y-axis I have
traffic and resources traffic and pink
resources in blue and on my x-axis I
have time we can say this is like 30
minutes so it's the same time frame on
both left side and the right side here
okay
so I got my pencil tool here we'll make
sure we're set to the right color and
let's draw some traffic so let's say we
have some traffic like this we have a
little bit of a peek goes back down
and then we have a bigger Peak sustains
there goes down
and then goes back down here okay
so let's say this is traffic these are
users uh these are you have a sale or
something I don't know let's say you
have an e-commerce app or something like
that and then your resources which we
are representing in blue
so the resources you have allocated for
your infrastructure just to handle the
traffic uh on average you'd probably
perform around here right
and these are sort of manual rules
actually it's probably going to look
more so like this hold on let me grab
the eraser uh just Ctrl C that
it's probably going to look something
more so like this it's uh probably gonna
perform like here and then
no actually oops probably gonna perform
like here
and then go up the hereand then
probably something like this okay this
isn't it 100 accurate like this isn't
like a scientific graph or anything like
that but
what I'm trying to
to convey here is that roughly the
resources will follow the traffic uh via
some like generic or some general rules
like
let me grab this tool here and let's
grab another color let's grab like a
green and you see here we have a peak
here
then we have a peak here
but at this point right here
and then at this point here so what we
end up having here
is so these are our peaks in the traffic
and suddenly this starts to go up
so here is where the
infrastructurelet's make this a little can I make this
larger how can I make this larger like
this here we go
so here it could be a rule like when
above 50 percent
CPU
utilization
scale out something like that right so
we are going to respond to an increase
in traffic with this scaling rule
and the same kind of happens up here
except it's the other way around right
uh
we start to notice that actually this
might be closer to here we start to
notice that the traffic is going down so
when
below
50 CPU utilization scale down okay right
so you're gonna get your resources to
either scale out
um scale up scale in in this case it
should be scale
scale in
because we're doing scale out and
scaling right
and we are in this case we can say that
we are
engineering and Engineering for Peaks
and we can grab this we're going to put
this in
a different color here we're engineering
for Peaks here nothing wrong with this
so workloads that work perfectly fine
when you find when you are just
utilizing this type of scaling
elasticity is also a type of scaling but
it's different we're going to see it in
a little bit
but right you you have these sort of
upfront rules that you put into place
maybe you've analyzed your traffic
before and you just know that okay
whenever we have Peaks our resources
tend to require this type of scaling
Behavior so let's put those we'll Define
those rules up front
overall it can seem like a very
like you're making like assumptions and
like very manual types of rules being in
place
and it works of course uh for different
workloads right
but in let me copy this exact
line of traffic here and we're gonna
move it over to elasticity actually I'm
going to switch my camera also this way
what it would look like what our
resources would look like when it comes
to elasticity is wait no this is pink
and then I need to grab
another one that is blue
it aregrab this again but I want to do this
here okay
uh resources would closely follow the
traffic
scale out sustain scale in sustain
scale out sustain
scale in sustain scale in sustain right
I'm going to erase this little dot here
because that has something to do with
anything
so here you can see that the scaling of
the resources is a lot more Dynamic and
it's a lot more sudden
and this is heavily based on metrics
logs if you're using Azure it's probably
something like Azure monitor application
insights those those types of logs and
metrics that are available to you if
you're using AWS probably cloudwatch you
might be using data or New Relic there
are a bunch of different sources you can
utilize right
so here what we end up doing
engineering for sudden and dynamic scale
right now this is obviously going to beway more pricier well I guess way more
depends on what your scaling situation
is up over here
but generally
we'll just put like two something like
that generally elasticity can be more
expensive than your standard scalability
now elasticity is scalability
you are scaling but it's more sudden and
dynamic like I mentioned so it's kind of
like a higher level a higher tier
when you think of scalability you're
thinking maybe things like scale sets
um like virtual machine scale sets when
you think elasticity you're probably
thinking something like a traffic
manager uh like a load balancer
um things like that right where you are
matching the traffic suddenly and as
soon as possible this is a lot more
automatic it's more so putting in place
like grabbing the right metrics and the
right logs and putting them into uh
where they're available to your
resources so your resource like sees
like oh I got this
um I got this metric from the virtual
machine that says well from the from
Azure monitor that says our traffic is
starting to go up let me scale myself
out oh I got this new metric that says
our
our traffic is going down let me scale
down right so there is a
slight difference and it's important to
understand when you would use one over
the other
you know for critical workloads probably
something on the right makes more sense
but again you always have to keep in
mind the cost as everything in cloud
like you know you have your pros and
cons and the cost is always going to be
one of them right so yeah I hope this
better explains these two concepts for
you I have a couple other ones that I
remember doing really really bad out
that I want to make more videos on I'm
going to export this diagram and put it
somewhere for y'all to be able to
reference if you need to
but if there are any other Concepts you
want me to cover let me know and that's
it for this video
