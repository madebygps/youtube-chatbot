all right so the simplest way i can
define a cloud engineer is you're the
person who makes
sure a solution is running efficiently
in the cloud now
how early on in the life cycle of a
solution you're involved
in really depends on how your cloud team
is allocated and structured
at your company so say it's a small
company
and there's just you as a cloud person
then you're going to be involved from
the very beginning you're going to be
solution architecting you're going to be
provisioning development and staging
and production environments and testing
and all the cicd pipelines and once
it's time to deploy the solution you're
going to make sure that
all the administration and monitoring
tasks are set up
for success and it's running well and
then as there are updates
to the solution you're going to be
making sure that it still runs the way
it's supposed to run
right now being a cloud engineer at
company a
could look very different than being a
cloud engineer at company b
and it's just the nature of the field at
the moment you know the role is still
relatively new we're also trying to
figure out
who does what but at the end of the day
in every role
there's a lot of like even roles outside
of cloud engineering just think like
software devs
software dev company a will look
different than a software dev
a company b but you can use this to your
advantage because
if say your work at a small company and
you end up working on every stage of
what a cloud engineer should be doing
say you do some solution architecting
say you do some administration
um then you get that hands-on experience
and you kind of get a feel for what you
like doing i know this was my case
i worked at a place where i got to do a
little bit of everything and
i ended up realizing that i really like
solution architecting
and now that i'm on my own i'm picking
up clients where i could specifically do
situations and problems and solutions
where i'm
solution architecting um so yeah use it
to your advantage
it could be sometimes frustrating but
you know it is what it is right
in terms of certifications that i
recommend it's hard to give
super general advice but what i will say
is if you're brand new to the cloud
get whatever the entry level
certification is so for example for
azure it's the azure fundamentals for
aws it's the certified cloud
practitioner
from there i recommend looking into
the and the associate level uh
administrator exam so
for azure would be the az-104 and for
aws it would be i believe it's the
solution architect
associate because those certifications
give you
a wide level of high level knowledge
so you get to play around with a bunch
of services without necessarily focusing
on anything too much but
while you're studying for that
certification kind of get a feel for
which services you enjoyed
and then which ones you would want to
focus in on a little more so maybe you
take the az-104 and you realize i really
like learning about the developer tools
or i really liked learning about
security or i really liked learning
about the solution architecting part so
from there
you can pick the next certification and
really
like focus in on the material that you
enjoy again
for giving general advice it's kind of
hard everyone's in a different stage at
their career but that's i guess
the most general advice i can give and
you don't have to follow it
exactly i know personally i'm not
following my own advice
i had a few years of hands-on with azure
and i knew that i really wanted to learn
about solution architecting more
so i'm studying for the 303 and then i
plan on circling back to the 104
up so that's just how i'm working but if
i were to do it again
i would do 104 and three other if you
want to talk cloud
hit me up on twitter madebygps
or catch me on a live stream i've been
studying a bunch of different topics
right here on my youtube channel live
and yeah
i will see you in the next video thanks
for watching
