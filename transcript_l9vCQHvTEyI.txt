I failed my Linux certificationwhat's going on party people welcome to
a new video to be honest i wasn't really
going to share this video but then i
asked hey
if i would have passed would i have
shared a video and i said yes
so why isn't that the same mindset after
failing
i don't think that's fair i just share
my honest and
authentic experiences and that should
include failing
right so i took my lpi 101 yesterday
and i did not pass i needed a 500 pass
and i got a 450
and that was a very humbling experience
i don't feel like a
failure but it was a very hard reminder
that gwen though you have
this growing youtube channel and you
have that award back there that says
that
you're very knowledgeable in something
there are areas that you simply have no
idea what you're doing
if i were to have taken i guess the
easier route and just gotten another
azure certification
yes i would have had to study but i'm
pretty familiar with azure so i would
have passed
but settling the goal to learn more
linux
and feeling brand new to something again
was very humbling
uh and was exactly the experience that i
needed because now i am somewhat
obsessed um
i i haven't i've been trying this this
linux distro that's called popos
it's a dbm-based linux distribution and
i've been
trying it on a spare laptop for a little
bit and
i don't know i really really like it so
i switched my main desktop i'm going to
show you right now let me switch to the
desktop view
so i switched my main main desktop to to
pop
um and it's actually been quite the
experience but i'm actually happy that i
did it um and i'm i've been on sites
like try hack me
doing activities on there and the
learning paths on there
doing more linux courses on a cloud guru
i picked up a couple of books this one
is
amazing linux basic for hackers you get
to get hands-on
you get to get you get hands-on uh like
activities and
and and stuff based on cali linux
cyber security and such uh like pen
testing and things but anyway
besides all that material that i have um
it's a new skill that i never knew that
i was going to enjoy as much as i did
so though i failed i gained a lot more
but
all this to say that no matter where you
are at in your career you might be new
you might be somewhat new somewhat
experienced very experienced you're
always going to be new to something
so the best skills that you can have is
simply put yourself in challenging
situations where you're going to
learn two learn how to ask questions and
learn how to fill
the knowledge gaps that you are missing
and three
be okay with rejection and failure and
i'm just here to remind you that yeah
it's gonna be hard
um you're gonna probably
face rejection and failures but
keep going i mean that's what i'm gonna
do i would advise you to keep going
the only way you could actually be a
failure is if you use those exam dumps
where it's like
hey download this pdf of 200 exam
questions memorize them memorize the
answers and then you pass certification
if you do that then you are a failure
and if i would have done that i would
consider myself a failure as well
but you didn't do that oh wait i didn't
do that and
hopefully you won't do that uh but
anyway yes
here i am just giving you a friendly
reminder and especially to myself
that it's okay to fail just keep going
alright see in the next video
