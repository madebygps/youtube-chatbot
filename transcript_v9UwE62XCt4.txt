My biggest mistake as a cloud engineerwhat's going on everybody so i was just
remembering this
story so i figured why not share it with
all of you so if i could prevent
this from happening to any of you i'm
totally down for that so anyway
i was a junior cloud engineer and i was
just assigned my first task where i was
actually going
to own the solution end to end up until
then i was used to working with
you know other engineers and working on
projects that were led by
you know led by them obviously they had
more experience and more knowledge
than me so i would just work on pieces
of their projects but i didn't have to
make any
decisions necessarily on architecture or
which service to use or anything like
that
so i'm assigned my first task and i'm
excited of course
and since i was new i was given a little
bit more time to actually research
stuff so i remember sitting down with a
list of services that i wanted to try
out
and i log into my azure portal to my dev
test subscription
and i didn't set up budget or billing
alerts on
the subscription beginner's mistake uh
honestly this whole thing was
preventable if i actually had done that
but i did so anyway
i remember playing around with azure
service bus which if you're not familiar
it's a messaging service
in azure and it's quite expensive um
i mean at least it was back then um but
anyway yeah i played around with it for
like an hour or two
and then i you know logged off and a
couple of days go by maybe a week i
can't remember exactly the timeline
and i get an email from my boss and it's
something like hey there's this charge
on our invoice that i don't recognize
can you log into cost management and
take a look
get more details and i'm like sure i
didn't think much of it i really didn't
think it was going to be my fault really
so anyway i realized that that charge is
associated with my dev test
the subscription so i get more details
and i realize that it's that's
that uh resource that azure service bus
resource that i never erased
typically i'm careful even from the
beginning i've always been careful with
like removing resources when i don't use
them
nowadays every cloud tutorial that you
look at there's always a disclaimer
there that tells you hey
i'd like at the bottom like hey remove
this resource when you're done
i just didn't so i emailed my boss right
away
hey i'm so sorry take full
responsibility feel free to deduct the
charge from my salary or whatever
um and then you know send the email and
then from the time i get a response
uh i it was probably like a couple
minutes but it felt like an eternity to
me
and i was thinking like man i'm gonna
get fired how could i do this such a
silly mistake
um you know i just got promoted like you
know all that kind of stuff so
uh my boss pretty much was like hey
don't worry about it just go implement
billing alerts and budgets
uh in your subscription and you know
beginner's mistake that's pretty much it
uh so shout out to that boss
for turning this mistake into a learning
experience
uh thumbs up for that uh but yeah again
super silly mistake easy to prevent uh
and if you are all getting started with
projects or learning cloud
i highly recommend to take just some
time to look into
cost management and whatever cloud
platform that you're using right
so yeah anyway uh don't forget we have
the az900 live stream
come hang out learn about azure study
with us i'll make sure to leave that
link
in the description also i'm doing
an azure study hour every friday for the
next month
on twitter on the icloud guru twitter so
you can come and ask me anything related
to azure i will have time to sit down
and answer all of your questions
uh so that's gonna be a fantastic time i
can't wait to read all those tweets
and that's pretty much it if you enjoy
these kind of like short stories about
experiences that i've had in my cloud
career
let me know i'd love to share more and
yeah
if you want to talk cloud hit me up on
twitter at made by gps
