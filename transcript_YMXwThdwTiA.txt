Difference between DevOps and Cloudcloud versus devops
it can be confusing because the people
who write these job descriptions will
often say devops engineer and have a lot
of cloud tasks in the description or
they'll ask for a cloud engineer and a
lot of devops tasks in the description
and the reality is that it really will
depend on the company that you go to
when i was a cloud engineer it was a
medium-sized company i was doing cloud
stuff devops off i operation stuff help
desk stuff networking stuff all these
kinds of things right so it depends now
honestly in the current state of where
the space in the field is
there's always going to be overlap
especially when you're working with
cloud because you have to implement
devops practices
though if you are a devops engineer you
could be working completely on plan on
prem and not be working with any cloud
infrastructure that's what at all
but let's dive a little deeper into into
this so
shameless plug on learn to cloud we have
phase four devops fundamentals we don't
focus on every single devops practice
but there are some things that we
recommend you read
some of the
practices that we do encourage you to
focus on as and this is just focus for
beginners right some resources some
projects some things you should be
familiar with and some certifications
that you might be interested in
learn the cloud again is this open
source guide that richard and myself
have put together it's free we don't
charge you anything etc there's no catch
etcetera etcetera etcetera so i'll put
that in the description
um so devops has a bunch of practices
there's continuous integration
continuous delivery which is developing
pipelines that take your application
from point a from like whoever builds
them
and works on them
to point b where it actually is on
wherever it has to be deployed on so
your clients can actually use your
application right so that is a pipeline
but in between there there might be some
test well there should be some testing
some infrastructure deployment some a
bunch of other things that are sort of
put into the middle of this pipeline
right
um
and for for csud popular ones are github
actions if you are a beginner i highly
recommend just take a look at github
actions because most likely your
projects are in github already
um and then there's like azure devops uh
there's circle ci there's a bunch of ci
cd tools um but as a beginner focus on
the most popular ones and again i'm
going to say github actions version
control
developing your code with versions that
way you can roll back or see
how what other people have added to your
code because you can comment and things
like that
the most popular one is git
there are other ones but just learn
learn to use git get in github
infrastructure as code instead of having
to click around to deploy your
infrastructure you are putting together
a file that you can then execute it and
they will build and deploy your
your infrastructure right
um
ideally you would take this file and you
would also put it through your ci cd
pipelines right
and depending on which tool you use
there's terraform there is bicep there's
arm there's cloud formation there's
pollumi uh the language that you
actually use to develop these uh files
will be different
but i just mentioned the most popular
ones each cloud has its own as well
um so yeah that's infrastructure's code
and configuration management is
managing a whole bunch of
resources like uh servers which machines
databases uh i think things like jenkins
ansible are popular here continuous
monitoring is monitoring your
application in every state not just when
it's deployed um and tools like
prometheus or datadog
and every cloud platform also has its
own set of monitoring tools azure has
azure monitor um i don't know the other
ones i apologize but each one has their
popular one um
and then there's this book called the
devops handbook it's not a tutorial it
just tells you about the devops
methodology the devops culture and the
practices and why if you implement it
it'll make your the end result um much
more efficient like developing and
deploying your infrastructure your
application
more efficient and you have your
development which is the dev and your
operations team which is the ops work
better together
and here it says how to create
world-class agility reliability and
security and technology organizations
um
i really like this book highly recommend
it no i'm not being paid to say this
but it's not tutorial remember devops is
a set of practices
that is what you need to fully
understand
devops is a set of practices a culture
that you implement
there are different tools to implement
each set of practice
but devops isn't like
it's not you learn about terraform in
your devops engineer
now you have different tools to
implement different practices right
um
okay cloud
so now we switch a little bit into cloud
like i said you can implement devops
practices on-prem and never have to
touch anything in the cloud
most companies have some sort of
presence in the cloud now but there's
still a lot out there that just use
on-prem completely fine
on-prem is never going to ever leave
there's also hybrid
um but then you have cloud cloud
engineers so cloud engineer is an
extremely extremely generic and broad
role essentially if i see someone saying
i need a cloud engineer they're just
telling me that you're going to work in
the cloud to some extent are you
administrating are you developing are
you securing are you architecting are
you working on governance whatever it
might be or maybe you're doing all of
these in one
again
it mainly
depends on the company size smaller
teams will have you doing more things
higher like larger more focused like
companies that have have the ability to
have like more head count and such will
have more specific and
focused roles um
i'm not saying it's a good or bad thing
it's really kind of up to you when
you're in your career and what you want
to do
um but for example let's take a cloud
engineer who's most focused on
development they will work side
alongside the devops team to make sure
that the devops teams knows all the
requirements that you'll need for the
application to be deployed but they
won't necessarily worry about putting
those into the pipelines bringing those
into
or defining the infrastructure as code
or anything like that they'll just focus
on the application right if you are say
a cloud architect you are more so
building out the blueprint like hey we
need to use this service we should use
this over service over this service
and then you might have to work with the
devops team to make sure they know
everything um
that needs to get like deployed and such
um but you're not implementing any of
that
uh what is another example that i give
cloud admin uh cloud admin you might
because you when you think of like
continuous monitoring continuous
management i mean configuration
management continuous monitoring um
those are
tasks that are pretty much
what a cloud admin does like your goal
is to go and make sure that all the
infrastructure is performing as it's
supposed to if there are any alerts
um you might need to look into them you
might be the first person who looks into
them um
and things like that right so you might
be working alongside the devops team or
maybe even more so
that could be an sre which i'll cite
reliability engineer which i will do a
whole nother video on because that also
makes things a little bit more confusing
but let's just focus on cloud dope today
um
[Music]
well you get the idea right cloud
engineer is going to be more focused on
the cloud side which whereas devops is
more focused on making sure we grab all
the stuff that needs to be in the cloud
or on-prem and we deploy in a way that's
very efficient right with through these
different practices right i hope that
clarifies things um they are very both
areas are very high in demand pay very
well and then you can learn them online
um there's so much content out there to
learn all these things um and one thing
i will say is like if you don't want to
like code a lot
you do enjoy coding but you don't like
to code it like full-on applications
devops is
you're not
going to be asked to develop full-on
applications so that might be something
to look into
cloud also as as long as you're not a
cloud developer because cloud developers
will be developing cloud applications
all right that's it if you want more
videos on different roles or in
comparisons things like that let me know
with that being said uh
i'm gbs and thank you for watching this
