[Music]thank you[Music][Music]
foreign
[Music]one day I'm gonna get good at this
what upoh wait myall right just need to check sure your
volume is good good good good good good
let me close this close this what up
everyone do my favorite hit a like on
that stream let's get some people to
join let's hang out let's work on some
stuff let's answer some questions
overall let's let's use let's make
Saturday productive Let's uh let's get
some stuff done I have a project
um that I gotta build some
infrastructure as code files for but
I want to try to use terraform
but the kicker here is I want to use I
don't know any terraform I'm like a
Microsoft purist
I got no bicep I know.net Azure right
umbut
um
I want to take the opportunity to to do
something in terraform like the best way
to actually learn something is Hands-On
right
so yeah
But be sure to ask me questions all that
kind of stuff good stuff we'll see
but it's snap 30.
whatit's what does that mean
Big JJ what up Jason how you doingnumerical
how you doing what's up everybodyforeign
I feel like I got bit by a mosquito or
somethinghow's everyone doing todayoh nap timeall rightbe sure to ask me some questions while I
uh
figure this stuff out okay so we could
probably switch the screen one second
let me
uh or lower that downdo you work more with Cloud console or
automated I use the CLI pretty much for
everything
pretty much for everything
um hold on so let's switch to I got this
new layout here so let's do this all
right yes y'all can see that
so this is WSL see I'm back on Windows
today y'all I'm back on Windows today
and like I know I keep getting comments
like oh my goodness did you switch to
Mac are you back on Windows oh now
you're back on Mac surprise you never
know what I'm gonna be using
is gonna be a surprise okay
all right so w sale
I actually don't remember
what I call thisReturn of the Mackuh I think it's this timestamper API
I don't remember what I
called it I think it's this
uh
okaydo a programming video it's been a whileI don't code anymore AI is going to
replace all that stuff I don't need to
do it anymore just kidding
I caught a lot I just don't do videos on
it because the real the reality is that
those videos don't do well and if you're
trying to build like an audience on
YouTube
they don't do they don't do well magic
wise but I code every single day like
look at my um hold on let me show you
my contribution graph on GitHub uh where
is it
like I've been trying to be consistent
every single day build up that skill set
you knowum
hold on I gotta find this
so is everything good screen quality
good audio quality good video quality
good all that good stuff
let me know before I like start
well I want to show you my graph but
it's not loading herethere we go
all right look at that look at that
graph
you see it
so for the last 20-ish days right there
I've been pretty consistent I've been
pretty good
um
I've been pretty good with uhwith with coding every single day right
I could yeah I learned code every day
it's like part of the job you know
you're you're so fast navigating the
terminal I'm telling you I'm very
efficient with the terminal
I know how to move around quick I know
how where to get to I know how to filter
all that kind of stuff I have a course
bachelorbeginners AKA dot ms4 slash bash
beginners if you want to become
comfortable using command and stuff like
that too when it comes to Cloud when it
comes to anything like engineering
related if you don't have terminal skill
sets you're doing yourself a deserves
all rightso we'll probably make this a little
bigger here so anyway this is what I got
here but this code is this code is
disgusting this code is just filthy this
code is just not organized this code is
just not it's not it's it's good code
this it's a lot of potential in this
code but there's just too much going on
like there's no dependency injection
um everything is literally living inside
of hold on where is it
uh
[Music]
uh why don't I see
the oh here oh my goodness everything
literally lives in this one file for the
API is doing too much like we need we
need a layer in between those two
so yeah
but anyway what this does is I'll show
you all in a second sosometimes you got to take your content
with where the money is
yeah
I don't know we'll see what we'll see
what ends up happening
hold on a second let me open this up
here
here open this up do me a favor y'all
yeah hit that like uh button on the
stream that way we can get some more
people hanging out
asking questions all that good stuff
all right cool
what's your vs code settings what what
do you mean oh you know what I gotta do
you know what you know what I gotta
enable for sure
I gotta enable co-pilot let's reload
thisthe co-pilot is just
beautiful love it love it I'm gonna use
it to
I'm going to use it to uh create my
infrastructure okay so what I'm going to
do here is create actually let's do it
this way
uhdear infra
uh and then justhold on
I don't even know what's the what's the
extension for terraformall right one second y'all let's do this
we're gonna go to
deploy and Azure function with terraform
we're going to start we're going to
start with that so I'm gonna use a mix
of
uh hold on
so I'm going to use a mix ofuh chat GPT and go
co-pilot toto
um
hold on a secondto to teach me how to do this stuff
all right
Binghow to deploy an Azure Azure function to
Azure with terraform
I want so and I want to approach this
how I would any engineeringum
first by like finding like documentation
stuff and then once I have like very
specific questions I'll use tea you know
what let's chat GPT login let's log in
first
so I play for GPT GPT plus whatever it's
called cheap chat gbt Plus
umweren't you daily driving Mac OS I daily
Drive everything see I told y'all
someone was going to comment about it I
told you at the beginning of Stream So I
was going to comment I daily Drive
anything I daily drive Linux I daily
Drive windows I generally Drive
um Mac
we're gonna switch this to four
okay cool
so y'all will never know I'm just like a
little surprise
the only bad thing that sucks about this
is
gbd4 currently has a cap of 25 messages
every three hours I feel like they
change that though I feel like yesterday
was like this was set to four hours
but yeah
um so the Mac is just terrible for
streaming that's just the reality like I
would need to do I would need to have a
setup where my Mac is being like it's
sending its output to another computer
for it to stream so like offload the
video uh the like the live streaming of
the video to another machine and that's
just like too much work
that is too much work Okay so
also I think I have a
a button here I don't know there's like
a button that so I can like curse but it
like covers it like bleeps it let me see
one second
let's see I know I had it not that I
curse a lot butis that bleeping out the words people
tell me
okay cool anyway so gpt4 let's ask how
can I deploy an Azure function to azure
on a Linux consumption plan with
terraform
let's see what it says here oh I should
I should have put
I should have put that it's dot net
because this is that's probably going to
be
there's gonna be a problem
configure Azure CLI
make sure you have terraform install
their machine created terraform
configuration so I know I know bicep so
I'm gonna try to leverage my bicep skill
sets
it's like whenever I tell you all the
association the the association
uh pattern that I use I did a video on
this like two three videos ago
Association pattern so whenever I
learned something new in cloud or in
Tech in general I never learn it from
scratch
um and I think the more you learn Cloud
the less you're gonna have to learn
stuff from scratch so right now the
association pattern is I know Cloud I
know bicep I know Azure functions I know
what I fully deployed function has to
look like when it's in Azure so the
missing part is terraform so okay using
all that how do I grab terraform and
like implement it right
look at this y'all
hold on did it finishall right so while it keeps finishing it
says in solid terraform make sure you
have terraform installing machine you
could download the let's go hereuh Linux
can I just copy all of this
lovely open this up clear
CDs nah CDs Claire
and I wonder if it'll do it all
in one shot
voice changer is sending methis guy let me get up and hop back on
this Docker upskilling project flavor of
the day
today I'm just feeling like Windows
y'all I'm just feeling like using
Windows today maybe that's it right I
wish I could play music but then this
stream will not be monetized and that
kind of sucks in terms of like a
longevity standpoint also
um
I just feel like the music that I listen
to when I'm working is really weird and
it's probably going to be a little
off-putting to some people because it's
kind of just like very
uh very like not monotone but there's
not like lyrics or stuff like that uh I
like a lot of like Daft Punk's Daft Punk
stuff
yeah so we'll let this go
what's your vs code settings my vs code
theme is deep material deep dark uh I
love this this is literally I never
change it unless deep dark material
theme unless I'm doing hold on let me do
a zoom right here here you go deep dark
material theme you can see that yeah
um
I never change it unless I'm doing some
kind of demo and for accessibility
purposes I need to do
a white like a wider or lighter theme
then I'll do something else okay
what is up with this
why is this taking so long oh
oh you said ask for my password No it
didn'tI think that's my passwordI don't actually remember all my WSL
password is
but yeah while we wait for this to
install how's everyone doingterraform Dash version or is it Dash
Dash
nice okay
what up everybody should show her she's
so harsh that coding do nothing it's my
own coat so I could be very umvery harsh about it okay cool so we got
terraform
so it told us
uh make sure you have terraform assault
on your machine you can download the
latest version blah blah configure Azure
CLI ensure you have the Azure CLI
installed in your machine
oh yeah I have that and that you are
signed into your Azure account by
running I'm pretty sure I'm I'm pretty
sure
easy account show Dash Dash
query
I think it's just name
Okay cool so I'm set to the right one
there what else I gotta do
uh create a terraform configuration file
create a new directory for your
terraform configuration files and
navigate to it create a new file name
main.tf all right that's it that's first
step right there
let's go into here uh
where are we here
uh CD infra and then we'll do
uh Tut no code main.tfhere we goextension has search Marketplace let's
see what extensions they have yeplet's let's do this
do me a favor if you just if you just
got here here like uh we only have we
have 17 likes we got 22 people watching
hit a like on that stream
also just to preface everything I I have
never used terraform ever so this like
I'm gonna make a lot of mistakes but I
want to embrace
that and show more of it so okay so we
got thiswe'll close this here we'll close this
here okay cool so where is it here
oh my goodness here we go
here is a sample terraform configuration
to deploy an Azure function on a Linux
consumption plan provider Azure IM
feature should I just copy it and then
we'll just look through it as we go and
Via his code
so I'm I'm okay so bicep looks very
similar to this which is great
ah hold on okay so I need to I need to
change this so what I need to do is
okay hold on
can I write this here uh how can I
deploy an Azure function on Lexus
country plan no and Azure eight so we
can put here dot net oh come on dot net
seven
out of process Azure function let's be
more will be more specific there okaydeploy a DOT Net 7 out of pro because
for for functions you have in process
and isolated when it comes to.net out of
process or isolated are the ones like
that should be the default one that
you're using anyway
so okay we got everything I think I got
I think I'm on done at seven yeah I
gotta be
yeah and then this project is done at
seven two I'm pretty sureyeah cool
back
all right
so
okayuh Creator publisher
okay here we go
create a terraform configuration file so
we're back hereand I'm probably gonna copy paste and
but edit it before we actually run it
because
as bad is is bad practice to just copy
code that uh GPT generates for you
look at me I'm gonna be a devops
engineer in no timeit's so crazy where this technology is
at like
people who are like I was I was speaking
about this earlier but you know like
yesterday but people who are on the
extreme of like oh we have nothing to
worry about
and the uh or with like AI will never
replace us and then we have the Other
Extreme where it's like we're all doomed
there's no hope for us AI is going to
replace us are missing the immediate
opportunity where I who have like I
someone who has never ever used
terraform before can pretty much use an
association pattern which is what I'm
doing now it's like okay I know where I
need to get I kind of have an idea how
to get there I just don't know how to
use this specific tool but I can go ask
specific questions to this thing and it
can guide me alongthis is probably not right
also this is this doesn't seem like it's
done it like stopped it's like stopped
generating
but for now we can copy copy this code
hereso we're gonna.net ice I know so I know
for a fact this needs to be done and
isolated
just I know that because I've deployed
this so many times with umwith other tools I feel like when
silence changing into being productive
on my Saturday also let's switch my
camera over here
oh come on
come onoh wait wait wait wait wait I'm looking
at the wrong one I'll do this one
no sorry sorry I keep
I keep uh
oh no I didn't include the chat in this
one one second y'allsorry I keep moving itsorry I'm the worst
okay there's chat we'll put the chat
over here because it's a little easier
to see
okay cool
alrighty so let's look through this
let's look through this
let's look through what it generated us
okay provider Azure RM I know a
terraform uses providers
as in like that's where it gets gonna
get deployed
rightI don't want to use up my tokens for
gpt4 so let's go to Bing
let's go to Bing chat
it's only available in Edge come onuh bing.com that's crazy all right what
is a provider in Terror form
okay
no chat chat chat me up what is a
provider and tear okay you're you're
gonna respond to meuh
uh in terraform a provider is a plug-in
that allows users to manage an external
API okay it acts as a translation layer
that allows terraform to communicate
with many different Cloud providers
databases and services all right so it's
like sinceriform is cloud agnostic you
got to kind of tell it what to work what
to work with right cool cool
uh Hey Gwen hello GPS hi everyone
welcome so cool so I guess if we're
reason something else we'd use the AWS
there so it makes sure it makes sense to
use azure
uh also people do me a favor if you ever
hear like some crackling in the audio or
like the video starts freezing just let
me know in the chat all right I'm using
like a new setup so I need to make sure
everything's smooth and crispy for y'all
okay so we're gonna leave Edge open in
the background
so that makes sense resource uh Azure RM
underscore Resource Group okay so this
is
example
resource
uh resource okay so okay okay
so we're creating a resource of type
Azure RM Resource Group and I'm assuming
this is the name but we're going to call
this uh
timestamper API Dash resource actually
no hold on
usually and I'm sure this needs to be
abstracted into some kind of variable or
per parameters or something like that
but for right now we're just gonna leave
here uh the my preference is to always
do RG Dash so For Recess groups some
people do RG at the end but I do RG at
the beginning because that's just what
works for me okay
and I don't want West Europe as my
location I want east east
us2 name hold on no
example name what's the difference
between this
and this or are these the same this here
okay okay okay okay hold on no I get it
I get it now
I get it
this name is the name within the
terraform file right the referencing yes
so if I need to reference it in the rest
of the file that's the name this name is
actually what is going to be set as the
name in Azure all right so this needs to
be RG so in this case and I can probably
just call this
Resource Group name or maybe just a
resource Group
that's fine okay cool
now what we're creating is a storage
account I'm going to set this we should
have like I know in this best practices
to kind of like a prefix and like a
random generated ID but we'll get to
that maybe in another stream or
something like thatuh I have a question if you don't mind
ask if you don't mind me asking do you
think anime and gaming are just a waste
of time while learning clouds or just in
general
lovely question thank you for asking no
I just finished playing this video game
called breath of the Wild
and I loved it it was such a level game
such a lovely experience but most
importantly it is so crucial and
important to have hobbies outside of
your career that you can spend doing a
little bit every day or whenever you
just need a break whenever you just need
a breather now the key here is
moderation of course if you're doing it
too much it's consuming your life or
whatever it is or you feel like you're
you're not doing the things that matter
to progress your career then you me you
may need to re like reconsider what
you're spending your time but you don't
want to you don't want to be at either
extremes like waste too much time doing
like things that are not productive and
then having absolutely no life or no
personality out outside of your career
because those two like extremes are not
good
but having a balance like you know
sometimes I play like maybe 30 minutes a
day sometimes I ended up playing like
three hours a day right but as long as
it's not every single day is completely
fine okay
I would I would recommend having
activities that you can stimulate
um different parts of like
not just like uh like uh like so a video
game can stimulate you I guess mentally
and and like it's exciting it can be
somewhat creative because you can
essentially put yourself in a different
world right but also have hobbies that
maybe are like like a different type of
uh like physical like if there's a sport
you like or you like going to the gym
like personally I've been like walking
and running a lot more
um trying to get healthy that's the goal
for the summer y'all let's all get
healthy
um other other types of hobbies include
maybe like learning an instrument like I
got my guitar back here
um and every morning I've been trying to
spend like 25 minutes just practicing
again I used to play guitar as a kid and
then I stopped playing because I I
needed to focus on my career but now
it's brought me so much joy to kind of
just have it next to me whenever I need
a break to do that so different types of
hobbies spend different amounts of time
depending on like what your schedule
works like but yeah it's important to
have things outside of work because you
know you're a human being you need to
have a personality and that type of
stuff right
all right cool
uh another one let's do one more before
I dive into this again have you ever
felt like you were thrown into the deep
end of the pool how did you learn from
this and how do you feel about your
performance during this time yeah all
the time
the the last like significant time that
I felt like that was when I was
beginning The Bash beginning The Bash
for beginners course that I released a
month ago I was and that feeling had
happened in November of last year
because that's when essentially the
whole process started and I was like I
have I really have no idea how I'm gonna
put this all together like I because
because essentially when you're working
like a bit well maybe I'm not going to
generalize it but when you work at
Microsoft you have the ability to work
with whoever you want and however you
want but you really have to come up with
a plan from scratch and you have to go
and recruit the team you have to go and
say like we want we could do this we
could accomplish this this is why this
is worth investing time in
um
so you know me having only like a year
or so of experience there I was kind of
intimidated but I I draw out a plan and
then I just went and I executed it
I learned so first of all I met like a
bunch of new people which is awesome I
learned that it's like kind of like
Shark Tank like every time you got a
picture project and and you learn how to
create like great one-pagers you learn
how to like collaborate and stuff like
that and that was fantastic
um but I the the biggest thing is like
whenever you have that feeling lean into
it like trust your gut it's like so
intimidating especially at the beginning
when you don't when you feel like you
have no idea how you're gonna accomplish
it but in a couple of months or a couple
of days or a couple weeks or however
long it takes you you're gonna be able
to look back and like and like be like
man I figured that out and the trust
with your own with yourself and your own
skill set is only going to increase all
right cool
uh no question I love questions that's
the point of this like we're kind of
working on something but we're also
answering questions and stuff like that
too okay so next we have here I'm just
gonna call this first of all storage
account
storage account because we already know
this is a reference name right Azure RM
search account name we're going to call
this
timestamper API store that might be a
little too long Resource Group name uh
this is not example anymore this is
Resource Group oops
Resource Group
dot name
and then location would be Resource
Group
uh location oh no this is wrong hold on
wait Resource Group name restrict
location ECS okay cool account to your
standard lrs perfectresource uh Azure RM app service plan
okay we'll call this app service plan
and we're going to call this timestamper
Stamper APIplan there I don't know if hyphens are
allowed in plan names so we'll just
leave it like that for now
the location would be
research group
Dash no come on
Resource Group Resource Group name which
is Group location kind function app
uh Reserve true okay so also skus so
again remember I mentioned it's going to
be easier for me
it's going to be easier for me to
to learn something like terraform given
that I already have the context of what
like what a deployed function looks like
how to deploy a function to Azure using
other Technologies like bicep right so
in this case it's telling us okay what
SKU do we need here
well I know it has to be dynamic and of
type y1 because in bicep you also have
to Define it this way as well right so
boom cool
this is lovely like GPT generated all of
this now it's gonna work that's another
question but we're walking through this
step by step okay
okay resource the actual function app
and we're going to call this function
app and then we're going to call this
time Stamper API app
okay there we go
location needs to be resourced
group Dash location we're just going to
replace This research group name
Resource Group name app service plan ID
which would be app service we could
actually we're just going to call this
plan
shorter there
plan Source account name is going to be
storage account dot name
uh
what up nards right now we are creating
infrastructure as code files
for this so okay you know what let me
take a second here to show y'all what
I'm gonna end up deploying
me oh come on
made by GPSslash time Stamper API
okay so oh I have a pull request and an
issue
okay cool I gotta take a look at that in
a second so
uh I don't know if y'all I shared this
on my Community page but what we're
doing is I have this this application
here that will I provided a YouTube URL
and it provides me time stamps you can
see on the left side here it has like
time stamps and like a little summary of
what happens during that time
but it's just code the code's kind of
messy and ideally when you're creating a
cloud project you want to include CI CD
you want include a restrictions code you
want to test it if possible you want to
create like some documentation so the
code and people in the ways people can
use it locally is here but there's more
stuff I can add now I thought there
would be a fantastic opportunity for me
to learn something new like terraform
and leverage my existing skill set with
bicep and I actually be like okay how do
I use styrofoam to deploy this and then
I'll have a project using terraform boom
okay but I'm not learning from scratch
Association pattern my friends Okay cool
so that's what I'm doing okay if
anyone's interested in checking out this
API I'll send it here
uh all right cool go back here and we're
back in here okay so let's look at the
actual function app resource
uh awesome also thanks I was able to get
a devops offer two months ago coming
from software engineer background
because of your videos that is so
awesome I am so proud of you thank you
for letting me know that
um I'm always super happy to hear when
people land the jobs that they want uh
make the moves that they want to make
um so I trust I try so hard to like keep
creating and keep making this stuff free
because you never know who it's gonna
help so that's awesome
really proud of you I hope you
I hope you celebrated yourself
um you know
however it is that you do that
um and yeah like welcome to the lovely
world of of devops and Cloudall right let's keep going
location app service plan search account
search account access key
storage account access key where the
heck is that
storage account
like that not primary access key where
is it getting this is this like a secret
thing waitAuthority cam maybe it's able to
retrieve it
as like a return like an output we'll
see
okay cool
uh site config isolated.net isolated
lovely Azure beam example
slot staging
okay as location
this I know I'm gonna have to I know I'm
gonna have to change but I'm I'm gonna
have to like find a tutorial on this
though but we'll see location Azure
Resource Group Dash
Resource Group
the location Resource Group dot name
function app is
function app dot name
plan Dotplan dot ID
storage account is storage account dot
name perfect
is storage account dot primary access
key lovely okay cool
uh all right so now what
it says there's an error somewherewhat is the error herethere is no clue where where
two three four
uh
oh here here there there we go lovely
lovely all right so what does it say we
do now
where's chat GPToh wait no it did
so I config
oh there's more on this hold on no wait
no there's not more in this
so I can figure resource
[Music]this is a slotplan okay hold onit's good
so how do I deploy thislet's do terraform Dash helpit says prepare your working directory
for other commands well check where the
configuration is valid all right let's
do that right tarot form terraform
validate oh no no it's not validate it's
yeah
the configuration requires provider
registry but that product is available
you may be able to install automatic
terraforming all right terraform init
terraforming it y'allterraform has successfully been
initialized okay
terraform validate does it work now no
something's up
oh hold on okay
it says here
reference to Undeclared resourceAzure I am Dash underscore app
underscore service plan has has been
superseded by Azure RM service plan
okay but also I have an error here that
sayswhat does it say reference to Undeclared
resource on line 48 it's probably like
some naming thing that I did wrongforty forty forty forty forty eight uh
so this should be plan
depends on plan that's good
but this is saying that we need to
replace this with just
like that
because there's a new version all right
let's try it again
terraform validate
no there's lots there's so much wrong
now
the the
the on May 19
the OS type is required can I just say
Linuxcan I just say Linux uhkind function appLynn wait hold on yes okay
copilot man co-pilot knows what to do
all right let's do telephone valid again
all right it looks like we got less
errors which is good
skew name is required but the excuse
right hereblocks of the type skew are not expected
here okay
hold on let's see let's see let's see
let's see let's see
Q name
iswhat is the skew name
oh maybe like
dynamic
is this it Dynamic y1 yes oh my goodness
please be that
all right Claireuh okay okay with Azure RM service plan
on 23
line 23 here
can't cut okay so I guess this is not it
I feel like I don't know I feel like
we're making too many changes now
value for unconfigure I shouldn't plan
so you know what before we make so many
changes what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
go into good oldterraformokay
give me an exampleabstract plan OS type skew name
okay cool
now let's go back here so that means we
don't need
we don't need thisall right let's try that nowuh excuse namebiwa oh okay so it's not Dynamic it's
just y1now we have an issue inline 31 app service plan is this here we
just need to rename that and then a 45
uh we need to rename this to and then
let's do it nowcheap PT okay so you know how everyone's
like GPT is going to replace all of us
it's giving very buggy code which is
great because it's a great startup point
right but you can see how all this stuff
is so outdated so there's many changes
that we have to do
okaythe Azure RM function episode has been
suited by Azure okay okay so this is
what we got
it here
and we got to replace this and let me
see if I can find an example of this
and then our jobs are safe for now
peopleAzure
here we gosearch a cow service plan
but you know what you can feed it
you can feed it documentation and then
it can give you an answer which I think
is cool
Azure RM Linux function app example we
can copy this here
Azure arm service plan
all right so let's go here let's go back
hereand let's justuh
I guess I could just
remove this boomall right
remove thatand have our Resource Group name
Resource Group
location Source account name is storage
name storage
there we go service plan is planned
plan
dot ID
I don't know if we need this version
let's seelet's validate once moreokay version is not expected here
and then I gotta go toreference to Undeclared resourceshow much scripting should a freshly know
to launch a career in devops or sysadmin
you need to know you need to be able to
do all the things that you can do
in the console
in the console if you haven't noticed I
have not once touched
I have not once touched a UI or anything
like that you need to be able to learn
learn something like bash or something
like Powershell and take it a step
further and Learn Python okay
uh but hold on let me see
version line 53 line 53 line 53 what's
wrong here Oh No 53 okay Azure oh
there's no app here that's why
uh function app
[Music]
53 here
I think it's just
all rightuh Linux effect version with Azure Ram
function app in the resource
Linux effects version here
site config
all right says it doesn't need itline 48
function app name is uh what is it now
Azure RM Linux
Linux function lit Nix okay cool
let's go return from validate
insufficient site config blocksat least one second food blocks are
required
okay hold on let's go back to the
documentation and see what it says here
okay it asks this here
let's go
to site config for
do I need this I don't know if I'll need
this but we'll take a look in a second
app settings I think it's here
boomclear
validateoh there's another one the Azure RM
function app slot resources bins okay so
we gotta we gotta replace this toookay so we'll go down here see I had to
update all this GPT code
so our jobs are safe for now people
that's the good news
there's probably gonna be a lot here
that I gotta fix tooon line 46function app ID is required okay
location function app name
function app name function app ID is
it's probably I don't know I'm just
gonna take a guess here
functionab Dot dot ID I'm gonna it's
probably gonna be something like that
right there coolglaretelephone validate we have online 48it says in Azure shuffling example
location is Groove
location is not expected here really
you don't need to know the location all
right fineall right last one says 49 Resource
Group
it doesn't need to know the research
group either all right fine how do you
know what are you just using the plan
how do you know where touh okay 48function app name is not and then it
also says ID okay so what is it what
does it need
is it just using the plan
okay it's also not accepted no there's
all right so this is not right we're
gonna go back to the terraform
documentation
and look it up hereyep agreed with the answer perhaps
ansible should have some validation too
yeah all right cool so Azure Azure of
service plan function app slot literally
just needs to name function app and
function app ID and storage account name
name function app ID and storage account
name cool
name
function app ID
this function app name Now function
function app ID equals like there we go
perfect oh man you gotta love get GitHub
Copilot
I need to configure this alone
format document lovely
and what did it say okay it doesn't need
the storage account name
how how is your Mac experience anybody
that's from Unix native system I'm back
on Windows I was literally telling
people at the beginning like I one day
on Windows one day I'm back one day I'm
Linux like
it's like I roll a dice in the morning
whatever lands on that's what I do
terraform validateuh
line the slot example can't configure
value for
so I don't
52 all right so I guess it doesn't need
this here
I don't know I feel like this is not
gonna work but we'll see
oh my goodness y'all
look at thisso how do we deploy this terraform help
we'll see can I do just Dash h
a terraform laga provider refresh show
test unique workspace
uh
uh plan plan show changes required by
the current configuration okay
Creator update infrastructure knit
validate okay so next one is to do
terraform plan
and we'll see what it doesI guess this is going to take a while
so while that happens oh no let me open
uh
what we're gonna do is do AZ group AZ
group list and we'll do an output table
and we'll see what groups I have just to
make sure I do have a Time Stamper group
but I don't have a time Stamper what am
I calling it here I want to make sure
okay we're going to call it timestamper
API okay
soit should deploy timestamper API if it's
correct
okay
let's take a look here
so it says terraform will perform the
following actions terraform function app
will be created
resource
known after known after no no blah blah
blah
Azure function Linux function app slot
example will be created lovelysite config
all right Azure RM research group will
be created
all right okay cool let's just do it f
it
uh eight wait what was it what was the
terraform Dash help what was the thing
to deploy apply
terraform apply
terraform apply wait how does it know my
subscription how does it know where to
apply it to how does it know where to
deploy I don't think I ever set that up
unless it uses the context of the Azure
CLI which would be nice
let's see what happens thoughdo you want to perform these actions
terraform will perform these action
described okay so okay so does a does
apply does apply run plan as well that's
cool if it does do the desk cooluh should take from EnV that's awesome
that's cool
that's cool that's cool so let I know
all right okay stops getting created
y'all let's take a lookthere we go
now if it's gonna create successfully I
don't know but we'll take a look here
let's do easy AZ uh easy function
app listwhatdo thatwe have some but we don't haveoh hold on
Dash query dash dash query because I
can't see this name
maybe it might need to be uppercase
there
name like this
I don't know
oh my goodness I hate when this happens
all right so let's do this firstis it lowercase n n a m n a m ewait no it was hereI just need the name of each function
app deploy that's it why are you not
querying for mewhere is itwhy does it say that blowfish
that's funny
uhokay
we'll just do we'll just do this we'll
just we'll just output it to the table
for now I guess fineokay look at that we got now a function
app under the Reese the res the RG
timestamper API that's cool that's good
let's see
it completed all right so let's go to
Azure nowwhat do you think about security jobs as
your future career as my future career
or whose future career
who like what do you what do you mean
timestamp API
I'm gonna open these two because I I
know I have them deployed
oh wait no
yes sweet sweet credits okay so this is
the one I deployed manually like a while
ago
and this is the one I deployed just nowokay so right away what looks different
Ah signalr that's fine because I didn't
Define that entire form so let's open
both functions and let's see what's
different
yours your future career I don't have
any interest in security that's just me
though I'm not saying there's anything
wrong with it it's just not something
I'm interested in wait no I opened the
wrong onethis needs to be this year they have
such similar icons
okay Linux Linux app service plan y1 y1
okay so far so good
actually you know what let's do this
no like that I'll put this one hereuh
four one six six okay so like the real
key the real kicker
the real kick is going to be in
configuration
configuration
so
this
function extensions version needs to be
four
four nice work at run time worker run
time work it run time nice
lovely weren't open a I key okay cool
we got it we got our infrastructures
code
but to be fair we're still missing
we're still missing signal R soum
wait where'd it go
so we're still missing a
oh waittime super API
so we have a storage Account app Service
Plan app service slot and function app
app service plans storage account
function app there's no slot in here so
maybe I didn't need in the first place
I'm not really using key Vault but I
need signal R oh I need a static web app
for my front end okay and then app
insights for monitoring lovely but it's
get it's working out it's working out
well y'all this is cool this is cool so
what I'm going to do right now is just
do a little a little clear this up here
and then I'm gonna do a git add
and then I'm gonna do a git commit
and I'm gonna say
created
infra files okay then I'm gonna do a
little get pushy
get push get get push lovely
and then I'm gonna go to my I'm going to
close Bing I'll need you BingI'm gonna go to my GitHub
scroll upokay we're gonna go my GitHub
and wait what happened did it not work
oh I forgot to do a get pull no wait no
what happenedoh hold onokay I need a I need to get ignore I
need to add
so okay one secondI need to add in the git ignore to
ignore the proper files from terraform
so obviously I only need main TF right
um
someone said terraform destroy okay
we'll do terraform destroy because
that'll take that'll take down the
infrastructure rightwait no hold on that was not right CD
infra
terraform destroy here
but I also need I need to get ignore
what do I need to add to get ignore for
terraform
let's ask chat gbtuh what what
do I need to add to my git ignore it it
get get ignore file when I'm using
terraform terraform okay
tell me the truth when you when using
terraform you should have certain file
the director should get in our file to
keep up blah blah
okay so the entire terraform fileTF state
tfvars
so I'm assuming at some point I have to
to abstract like the parameters and the
variables two different file right I
think it's like a params filehold on one second y'allokay
so
so okay
I'm gonna copy thisand we're gonna go in here and we're
gonna go to my ignoreuh the other stock is starting to turn
from say okay hold on Telephone will
destroy all your management structures
shown before yes let's do that
and let's do that and let's add it to
the bottom
honestly it's probably better examples
of what I added terraform but for now
I'm not going to paste all I mean I
paste all of it in but where where to go
I just added this they're from directory
no dash
they should do it because this is like
literally any file without terraform
infra
uh but we could probably do like infra
dot terraform okay
State file surfarm
probably need to do thisinfra this because it's inside of this
file folder crash log
again inside of here and
the solution says anywhere but
I don't want you to be from anywhereignore override as far as they can taste
sensitive information
[Music]uh
terraforms ignores CLI configuration
files okay this thisoh no there's a terraform State here why
that's not
I'm just going to manually delete this
well once it finishes because I think
that's because I ran it's because I ran
the the command at the wrong directory
at the wrong pointsomeone said how to get into Cloud
without a degree
doing this stuff go online and teach
yourself all this stuff
that's how you do it but to be fair like
the other day
so when asking this question and the
reality is like the importance of your
degree matters more so on where you live
than the field right because like I have
the privilege of living in the U.S
but in the U.S the the
bias or the requirement of having a
degree is a is a lot more lenient than
perhaps other countries
so if I give you the advice of like oh
you can do this on a degree don't go to
school then I'm not taking into
consideration where you live and all
that kind of stuff right so for example
I used to live in Ecuador and like you
couldn't get a cashier job there without
a degree I don't know how it is now so
that's why I ended up moving back to the
US
so what I'm trying to tell you is like
you kind of have to go and upskill
yourself and like I was making the
analogy of a video game you're the
character and you got to go like power
yourself up to get the best option best
chance to land a role and if for
wherever you are having a degree is
what's going to do it then you're gonna
have to do it that's just a reality
right but if you're in an area where
it's like oh I don't really need a
degree I'm totally fine then go learn
the basics of
uh bash python networking uh Cloud
platform pick any of the big three
devops on mentals and then in like six
months you got two projects two certs
and then get a year of like support a
technical support experience you bundle
all that in like a year year and a half
you have everything you need and then
you can go start applying to your Cloud
roles
okay well I'm not using jetbrains and
this is already here so I don't need
thisokay
so I'm not I'm gonna delete this
okay I know I'm probably I'm probably
messed some stuff up okay get out
everything no it's like what does it get
remove
Dash
cached
I think it's this
now we're moving okay hold on hold on
okaylike that that yeah yeah there we go
okay so now I think I can do git add
boom get commit
added infra files and updated get ignore
I don't know if it's gonna work let's
see
I hate having get error so I really hope
that this doesn't work I mean this
doesn't give me an errorno we're gonna get an error why though
we put that
it says fivepercent you may
it's still trying to grab the uh hold on
from where though terraform
uh file Dash terraform but if you you
were told to ignore this file
to ignore this folder
Dash terraform
infrayou were told to ignore this
the history[Music]
let me see
you were told to know ignore this F
directory why are you not ignoring itpushing his care you know
what is yourand you oh my goodness
how okay hold on how much does the data
structures and algorithms has in your
success in mine none and yours it could
be a totally different story
yep agreed here in the Philippines for
Tech roles Tech related degrees are
still highly regarded depends on a lot
where you live or plan to work at yeah
that's why I don't like Tech influencers
out here being like get a job in Tech in
six months you can do this I did this
anyone could do this like that is just
not reality anyone can do it yeah but
like what worked for one person might
not work for another person for a bunch
of good reasons Landing a job is 50 in
control and 50 luck so in that within
that 50 of what can you control like
it's not the same for you and for me
right I'm just trying to be honest with
y'allmaybe Dash Dash
Dash Dashdo you use QE forget like no I don't I
also do Camilla stuff so I need to
reference this folder here
and I'm pretty sure I've done this
summer so we'll take a look at what's
wrong hereinfrahow
to reference a folder okay let's do it
this way let's do it this way okay I
have hold on all right I have a folder
called
infra and in it are terraform files
how can I ignore
ignore this direct this folder this
folder in my git ignore
file
wait
actually let's just do this I have a
folder called infra
how can I ignore
in in my root in my root directory
directory how can I ignore this folder
in my git ignore file all right let's
see if this workswhat is your preferred language for
scripting in Azure Bash bastion.net
oh look at I think we missed this y'all
let's seelet's seeokay
get remove that recursively
Dash cached all of itokay get add everything get commit
the same message that I did Above This
get pushnope still failingwhat What DOT terraform
in front
infra dot tariff why this I feel like
this should be so simple but why has is
this not working let me thinkinfra it's in this folder and in this
folder that is another why is this not
commit just get ignored maybe ahhold onbut it's cached alreadyokay get
a move because it's cached
get commit
removed cached files
get push
wait did I addnooh I forgot to addtry the asterisk asterisk at the front
Okay let's seeI feel like I've done this before though
so I gotta I just gotta find it I feel
like I did this in this projectsee like this worksyou know what I'm saying y'allinfra right herein infra we have dot terraformso this should workeverything that is cached[Music]
you probably need to commitno nookay let's figure this out
get removed
filespreviously added
added git ignore
git ignore get ignore something like
that
okay here we go how do I make git forget
about a file that was tracked but now
get ignore okay so it says
to stop track of file we must remove it
from the index to remove a folder
on the kit remove dash R dash dash
cached yeah that's what I didwhere are we okay
get removed dash dash cash boom
it did not match any files ahthere we go so it's notremoving API removing
infrared at terraform okay here we go
and for DOT terraform.lock and for okay
okay okay here we go we need you to not
copy
okay
literally everything in terraform like
it says to do everythingso hold onactually let me uh I wanna I don't know
why it's not tell me it just says
providers
terraformwell it's not supposed to remove this[Laughter]
oh hold on we don't need these any
eithert
okay
hold on let's do that again
we'll just do get add and then get
removed cached
and it says it's gonna remove
that terraform.lock but it doesn't say
it's gonna remove this onethis is the folder I need you to notget statusI should be
hold on get infra Dashall right hold on
it is it in Gray and vs that is ignored
yeah it isn't gray it's gray this is
grayed outbut the lock is not grayed out why is
that not that great out
let's see
uh
dot terraformDot Lock
do you push y'all do you push the
lock.hcl to get
I don't think so rightor you dowhat was the error though what was the
error saying whatyeah this is great it's not gonna go
it's not gonna go andOkay cool so then let's add that
hold on a second where's the terraform
stuffthat infra
dot terraform Dash
[Music]
dot Turf tear form
the luckall right
this this thingy this all right so now
we do this right now Duke's status wait
no no
get
there we go okay now it's grayed out
I think so
hold on
I'm confused againokay
uh added edit ratings
added infra files and get ignore
I swear I'm going to lose my mind y'allno it's not gonna work whatit says maybe we have large files in
before ignoring commit yeah but that's
what the cash that's what the cash
command is doing the cache command like
remove cache is supposed to remove us
from us right
file name for that telephone pressure
sure iswe want to try get large fileget
okay you know what hold on get removed
cached
remove dash dash
okay hold on a second okay
infra Dash Terror Forum terraform
there okayoh waitget removed do I have to how do I do
directory
oh recursively right I think it's Gotta
Be Like That
infra
dash dash dot terraform no this is not
gonna work I can tell already because
it's not autocompleting
get removed
uh
infrawhat is going on with my terminal hold
onwhat is going on exceed limit for cash
cash removed only from stage so when it
fails maybe we have large file the cash
removed only from stage see I had to be
careful the other day I assumed because
of line Innings I made it using
and where I made the file through the ID
and it worked search for error you will
find solution oh my gosh dude thank you
so muchI really do I need to search for the air
to find the solution come on man
we're trying to we're trying to we're
trying to challenge ourselves here okay
so
why is this folder first of all it's
grayed out
right it's great out rightso
we're probably you guys are right we're
probably pushingoh but then I have to re reset the head
back to maybe that's the thing
umwhere whyare you saying thatoh my goodness okayuh
okay so we'll do this terraform git
ignorelet's do thislocal terraform directoriesokay we'll add this someone did say to
addto add the dash dash the dot the
asterisk double asterisk at the
beginning sowait did Istill gonna failbut it's all gray now
so that's goodcheck commits history yeah I know I'm
gonna have to do that now
uh sothis is probably like this too rightand all the recipesactually let me look at what is saying
hereI should have just stuck to thisshould I be Dougie he's a great uh
Community member in the open source
space so we're just gonna do thisdouble deerget
get where
get removed recursively
uh Dash cached
cashed in here get add
git commituh get pushadd your ignored first by itself and
commit thatdelete everything push it no this is I
don't know why it's still tracking this
it's literally right here it's and it's
grayed out[Music]all right check commit history yeah yeah
yeah yeah
oh let's see what this is hereget removed previously files I think
this was itwait noI did this to remove a foldermm-hmmwe must follow it from the index
we must remove it from the index that is
what we're doing
all right we'll do this specifically the
infra folder okay
say infra infra boom
okay
add everything
I think that's the culprit get commit
what's am no just m adding in for
filesokay yeah this is what we gotta remove
this we're gonna get push
we got uh edityeah this is gonna failokayget edit commit historychange most recent no I don't want to
hit the choose commit files
remember father for safety but we did
the commit yeah yeah yeah yeah but I
thought I thought commit uh remove cash
would do it but I guess not
what's the command to
this this this get reflog let's
there and see if it's not gonna get easy
recordkick mid to change your latest log
message get commitment to make obviously
is the most recent commit get rebase
commit and modify history of Branch Gary
gives much more fine-grained control
over it
I think it's this I think I've used this
beforebut let's do it get
remove commit from history there we goyeah I know it's something like that
like with the head thing I just don't
know exactly what it is
this says remove commit from history I
enteredI entered a curse word in my code and I
pushed the code on the master branch
I push the code a few more times after
that so people do not pull the bad stuff
but I can still find the curse word in
the commits history
all right
once you push the reach you don't really
want to go changing however if you're
absolutely sure that nobody is pulled
the first okay you have two options if
you want to remove the bad commit
altogether every commit the camera do a
good reset hard assuming
ABC's the hash of the bad commits and if
you want just edit commit Pacific
commits thank you but how do I get the I
can't reset dash dash hard
someone say soft
get revert to revert I committed from
history if you want to get revert maybe
that's what you're looking for get
revert okay one second
if you want to edit that commit and
pursue the commits that came after that
do a get rebased much editorget rebased Dash I okay that's what we
need for right nowget rebase Dash I
all rightcreated added infra okay so this is the
one that messed everything up rightpick created info files
okayso we have that now right oh dude we're
going for a ride
man who knew that git was the thing that
was gonna get me stuck today right
okay if you want to remove bad commit to
the
is the hashback commit the one you want
to see is that
push force or get push okay so git reset
Dash get
reset
dash dash hard
thatokaynowthe one you want to see is a new head of
commit a branch then do a good push
Force but this commit still has the file
right let's see get rebaseoopshow do I delete this commit all rightrebase pick reword edit squash fix up
break drop label reset so essentially I
want yeah I guess I want to delete this
this pic viewer squash break drop remove
commit okay so if I say
drop right and then I do write out boom
boom exitoh my goodness did I lose everythingI lost where's my terraform file
oh my goshokay
one second y'alluh what was it code me wait no hold on
uh code infra main.tfyeah there we go
boom oh my goodness I almost lost
absolutely everything
Okay cool so now
what else did we lose okay so since
that removed everything I would have to
do
and apply to generate all the additional
stuffbut I don't need that because I know it
works for now right
so now where I'm at is
uh git add wait hold onit's still in the get ignore rightwhere's the stuff hereterraform no it's not here
oh back here here we go okay here we go
here we go here we go
hold on people
we're gonna copy this
and we're gonna paste this in hereand we're gonna paste that in there so I
haven't added anything yet
so now if we do get at everything
get commit
added infra files
two files change
89 get push
oh my goodness it worked
all right let's go back hereand we have an infra folder and we have
the main.tf let's go we figured it outokay coolumoh my goodness what a pain y'all
what a freaking painall right we're good we're good we're
freaking goodI just said I hope that state file is
somewhere safe wait get revert to undo a
commit git filter
Dash Branch filter index remove dash cat
oh my look at all these I saw you're
hitting too many dangerous kick commands
too many get filter get filter stop stop
sending the same comment I hope that is
the right version of the TF file Kappa
oh yeah it isbecause hold on watch
CD infra
clear unless
terraform validatetariff oh no terraforming it is gonna
okay this is a good testthis is a good test because it because
it generates a folder for us
right
we do get status we haven't added
anything so
okay
terraform lock on track
should this folder this should this file
be in git
let's Google it
actually it's actually should
hold onshould be in
get I guess Version Controlokay it is all right coolwe're good y'all we're good how long
have we been streaming one second let me
check
I feel like we've assume for a minute
now
an hour ten okay that's not that bad we
got a lot we got we got to get my work
done y'all we we should we struggled we
suffered
but we we got this done and hold onand most importantly my streak is still
strong
where is itcome onit's not loading here let's go over here
uh uh here herethere we go look at that look at that
contribution graph
dude
so since
February 23rd almost a month now I've
been doing something every single day
I did do something on March 12th but I
think it was learn a cloud and then
Richard ended up having to make some
changes there so it removed the
contribution from that date and it broke
but I know I've been doing this just
keeping the street consistent
okay
so cool
this is like a good movie with drama
gets like a gets like the villain of the
movieum
all right
we got we got a lot of work donemost importantly now I have some
hands-on experience with terraformhe generated some decent a decent like
starter template but in reality if I had
just gone to the terraform documentation
I probably would have been like better
off
for sure
because and what I ended up doing was
copying the code that it generated but
then putting it in and then did
terraform validate and all that stuff
was not necessarily the best
