How much code do I need to know for Cloud Engineering?hey everyone welcome to a new video i've
been wanting to start this
series where i grab a question that i
get asked often
and i spend you know three four minutes
just talking and providing my insight
again this is based off my experience
and my
you know i guess insight with working
inside of cloud and such like that
so this isn't like you know the final
answer but just you know more insight
right
now the question i get asked the most
is which programming language should i
learn and
how much code do i need to actually know
in order to work in cloud in order to
land a role
now like most things in tech
there isn't one perfect answer but what
i will say
is which platform are you learning are
you learning are you learning aws
are you learning azure you're learning
gcp you know first
settle on that once you know that go and
do some searching and see
which language has the most examples
and go with that one in my case when i
started working in azure like two years
ago
i really really wanted to learn python
because i thought it was just like
the coolest language and i wanted to
become really really good at it
but i found more examples of the stuff
that i was trying to do
in azure in dot-net and c-sharp
it had the most examples that's like the
easiest way i can answer the question
so maybe for aws it's python maybe for
gcp it's go and for azure it's dotnet
like whichever one it is
pick that one and move forward with that
one the reality is if that
you work enough with one language and
you understand the fundamentals
that will translate over into you know
learning a different language picking up
a different skill or
you know then later on you're like hey i
really actually like
this like programming stuff let me dive
deeper into like learning it and then
you can start building stuff like
you know websites and apps if you want
to right but you don't need to have that
full skill set to work in cloud your
your
your the importance i guess and your
learning should be focused on
understanding how to like
deploy um infrastructure and deploy
solutions
and and how to work effectively and
efficiently inside of the platform
with a language versus actually
developing these solutions
later on you may find yourself in a
situation like where i'm at now
where certain opportunities are
presenting themselves where if i was
better at like
programming.net i'd be able to take
advantage of them and that's why you see
me like studying.net and learning and
like
like on the stuff that i've been doing
on twitch and like the streams and such
um but that isn't the case for when i
was like it wasn't the case when i was
beginning like
just knowing enough to automate things
was more than enough right
uh but programming is definitely at
least scripting
it's definitely a skill in automating
things it's definitely a skill that's
going to just
take you like just like set you on a
correct path in terms of cloud
don't necessarily worry about becoming
the best you know software developer
anything like that
just know how to automate things um yeah
and that's what i would say in terms of
this question if you have any questions
you'd like me to take
three to four minutes answering uh leave
them in the comments
if you already know how to program or
you know if you're learning a language
can you let me know can you let me know
which language you're learning or which
language you know
and which platform do you primarily work
inside because i would love to know that
too
if you want to learn.net alongside me uh
join me on my twitch streams
i have one today 6 p.m eastern
if not i will see you in the next video
thank you for watching
