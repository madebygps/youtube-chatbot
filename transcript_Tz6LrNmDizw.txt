How I passed Linux Essentials (lpi 010)so i started off by
using this course lpic 101
course on a cloud guru disclaimer i when
i was studying for the certification
i was working at a cloud guru so i had
free access to their entire catalog
and they also paid for the certification
so i sort of just went with
of course i was available on there
because one it was free and two it was
sort of like the quickest like oh
i work here why not like take a look at
what we've got uh but i quickly realized
that video content isn't really the way
i learn which i know is ironic because i
have a youtube channel
creating technical tutorials
but yeah here we are uh so i followed
the course it's there was nothing wrong
with the material itself i just can't
learn following video because i was
doing like the practice exams like that
they have included in in
the course and nothing was just sticking
like i feel like i was just memorizing
things
personally i don't like to just memorize
i think that it's just a waste of time
and that is the reason why i don't have
many certifications i literally have az
900
lpi essentials and then aws certified
developer
with associate which is expired and i
think the az900 is expired as well
and i don't plan on renewing
the linux one either uh so yeah nothing
was really sticking uh so then i i went
out and i i got these two books one is
called linux basic basics for hackers
and the other one is the linux command
line and i essentially followed
the entire linux basics for hackers book
and then i used the linux command line
one as a reference
so whenever there were commands that i
didn't fully understand after reading a
chapter
in the first book i would use the
command line book as a reference i'd go
look up the command i wouldn't i didn't
read that from end to end i would just
look up the command to get more examples
and hands-on
like exercises and things like that it
was great
so my schedule was like
i think this was like january into
february of last year
i sat down eight in the morning i
studied until 10 a.m
so i would read the chapter and then get
notes but i wouldn't synthesize them
until the evening so the evening would
come out come around and then i would
actually write a blog post which is like
a neat version of the notes that i took
earlier in the day and i did this for
about a month
then i took the exam and it passed
um if you go to madebygps.com and you
hit on the linux tag you're going to see
all my linux notes there so the linux
essentials exam objectives
and like topic one is like very theory
based
and so is i think there's a couple of
other sections here
for example i think it's like topic like
topic four like choosing an operating
system like that's and understanding
computer hardware
whoops my girlfriend is calling yeah
okay not bad all right so like i was
saying uh topic four you have some stuff
that's like pretty theory based that you
gotta look up like operating system
stuff
uh understanding computer hardware
but then this here
understanding the different directories
and utilities and data stores and stuff
like that
the book will i think i learned that in
the book
some networking stuff also learned
topic five uh security
user groups
permissions ownership
and special directories and topic i
think i skipped over here like topic two
and
yeah
those two i learned also in the book
and then topic one is pretty theory
based as well i believe
up until around yeah i think so i think
a lot of this is just very theory based
okay so to summarize that
one theory based
just googled it uh
two i learned from the book
three i learned from the book
for
some theory
and some from the book
this part two and then five from the
book
so yeah
it covers pretty much everything
but i'm not telling you that the book is
a linux essentials
book
like it doesn't follow the curriculum
but you learn the basics of linux which
would make sense that the linux
essential certification is asking you
for that uh i don't have links go look
up these books i'm not i don't have
affiliate links because i don't want
your money i feel like people are going
to ask me if i recommend a cloud guru
i only used it because it was available
to me i don't really have an opinion on
them now
i don't use them now so that's my i
guess
answer
all right
i'll see in the next video
