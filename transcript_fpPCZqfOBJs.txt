How I Successfully Study for Cloud Certificationshey everyone today i want to talk to you
about
why i think certifications are useful
this is actually just going to be more
of um
like an extension of the blog post that
i wrote on the acg blog
so if you'd rather check that out i'm
going to link that in the description
with that being said hi welcome to
another video i'm gps and let's get
right into it
also say hello to my dog
alright so this is the study setup that
i use
whenever i'm learning really anything
i'll have my study material
so i'll go into a little bit as to what
i have here on the left side
in a second but let me go over to the
side first i'll have my notes up here
and i just use markdown i used to use
notion but now that i'm
moving my workflow over to open source
no software i'm just using markdown and
github to keep track of my notes
so that stays up there on the top right
and then
here i'll have either like as
sshed into my vm that i'm working on or
maybe i'll have the uh some azure cli
commands that i'm running here whatever
it is that i'm studying
um that's the hands-on portion will be
down here and then
again back to this side on the left i'll
have my actual study material
and this is my first tip for y'all find
material that works for you
you can see i have this book open which
is linux basic for hackers i talked
about this book
in my previous video and then i also
have this course python 3 scripting for
sysadmins
and this is on the a-cloud guru platform
all right so right off the bat i'm the
first one to tell you from personal
experience that certifications have been
beneficial for my career
because i got aws certified back a
couple years ago i landed an interview
which led to a job which led to a cloud
engineer promotion
and most recently i took another
certification at the beginning of this
year
linux essentials linux linux essentials
and that's led me to uh you know just
really enjoying this linux world and
open source world and and creating more
content around that
that's been fantastic as well on
linkedin on twitter it's easy to find
people who bash certifications
who think they are a waste of time you
know i guess that's a fine opinion i
have there's also people who love them
and
are obsessed with collecting all the
badges and such
and i guess that's also an okay opinion
to have frankly my way of learning and
my way of living
doesn't fit either of those models i'm
somewhere more in between and
i know when to study for a certification
and when to kind of just
wander off on my own way and figure
things out now
um for me i kind of have like this
framework that i apply to each lesson
to whatever i'm learning but i'm just
gonna use it in the context of studying
for certifications
i actually wrote about this on the acg
blog go check that out
and if you enjoyed it could you share it
please and tag me
all right anyway uh so it's kind of like
the seven step thing i like to call it
my don't
use study material like a netflix show
checklist
first i'll watch any lesson or read
whatever chapter i'll highlight any
concepts that i don't understand
second i will go through that list of
concepts that i didn't understand and
look them up
this is a great time for me to visit
official documentation
because you know knowing how to use
documentation and how to you know
find what you're looking for is a good
skill set to have three
i'll watch the course the video the
lesson the individual lesson or i'll
read the chapter again but now since i
have this new understanding of the
concepts that i didn't know in the first
place
things started to click and it's pretty
magical feeling step four is to just do
any on-screen demos that they're doing
if they're running through some sort of
example or exercise deploying a service
to the best of my ability
i'll do that on my own sometimes i get
there sometimes i don't but it's
additional hands-on and especially since
uh for example now i'm learning linux
and i'm not doing too much hands-on
with that kind of stuff at work any you
know extra
help or ways that i can get hands-on i'm
definitely going to take advantage of
that
so five is just the right notes you know
bullet points just stuff that i can
reference to
and stuff that kind of keeps me on track
because when i stop studying and i
resume
the next day or the day after whatever
it is um i know where to pick up and i
kind of it it serves as like a refresher
for myself
uh after that i'm gonna do any live labs
or any exercises or any bonus points any
anything
that they have assigned sometimes at the
end of a chapter they'll have like bonus
points implement this or
um like the course i'm using on a call
guru has
labs that i could use and i could do as
well um and i'll
do those so yeah that's the step six and
the last step is the most important one
for me and this might be
optional for yourself but again i'm here
just talking about what works for my
um and it's synthesizing my learning
online i'll turn my notes into a youtube
video or to a blog post or
uh you know i'll find ways to share the
knowledge online
and this really helps because i'm taking
my notes and turning it into
like a cohesive piece of content so it
builds my technical portfolio but also
might help someone else out and that's
the reality is you might not look at
yourself
as a teacher but you really never know
who you're going to be able to help
so that's kind of my mindset i just put
it out there um
yeah those are like the steps i take for
each individual lesson
and you might be thinking wow this might
take you forever to learn something if
you do all these things
and yeah you're absolutely right
studying for my first aws cert took me
like
six months i believe and then studying
for the linux one um i would say cider
back in december so about three months
or so
uh but it's worth it you know um i'm
building hands-on things that i can put
on my github and i'm building my
technical
content portfolios and and i'm you know
resourcing resourcing researching and
looking things up
in the documentation and yeah uh it's
worth it and it's been
quite beneficial for me uh i also know
when to take breaks or when to explore
other things right it's not always for
me like i just have to
learn a certification i could go and
pick up something else like with linux
it's super easy to want to
go out and just try all these open
source projects that are fun
well documented and that's what i've
been doing like building modules from my
magic mirror
or building a nas or deploying a ghost
blog on
an ubuntu server or finding open source
or open source alternatives to all the
programs that i've been
used to using and it's been great um
i'm still studying for my next linux
cert which is the linux foundation
certified system
administrator but i'm taking my time i'm
really enjoying it and i'm not forcing
myself to do anything again i know
that's because of where i am in my
career and it might be different for you
you might have to take a cert right away
or whatever it is uh but yeah
this is what works for me um one thing i
will say
is there's not one course out there that
will 100 answer everything that you want
it to answer you
and it won't teach you everything but
this is a good thing you got to look at
it in the way of like
it'll get you half of the way there to
some extent
obviously there are material that are
terrible like all exam dumps are
absolutely terrible and you shouldn't
use
but the majority of content does teach
you something um
and it's up to you if it works for you
or not right um we all have different
ways of learning and that's why it's
also hard for me to recommend any study
material to anybody
because what works for me may not work
for you but
as long as it enables us to learn and
well back to myself
as long as it enables me to get like
some momentum
i can try to fill in the gaps and you
know go and search on search for things
that i don't understand
and this is quite powerful because
oftentimes you'll be on a team that are
they're open to helping they're open to
questions but
you know i've also been on teams that
aren't quite as open and it sucks but
it's a reality
so learning how to figure things out for
myself has been
uh it's been great and i think courses
in
study material do that because none of
them get you all the way there
but anyway yeah that's it for this videoi'll see you in the next video
