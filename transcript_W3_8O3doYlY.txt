Which Cloud Platform Should Beginners Learn in 2023?the reality is that the answer to this
question
is going to be it depends but i'm going
to give you some advice as to how you
can
make this decision
i think a lot of people
and this is more tailored towards
beginners because it's usually beginners
who are asking the question which cloud
should i learn
once you have experience with one cloud
platform you already know that
which cloud i need to learn will depend
on my employer my job project needs all
these kinds of things right but for
beginners with no experience it's hard
to sort of have that mindset because you
know you haven't been through it that's
completely fine
i think beginners tend to go to
to google and then they find personal
opinions or they go on twitter and they
find like these
like opinions by like tech twitter
influencers or whatnot about like yeah
you have to learn aws because of this
you have to learn azure because of this
you have to learn gcp because of this
you know
the argument i hear a lot is
you just have to learn aws because it
has more market share
i think that is a flawed answer i think
anyone who gives you a definitive answer
without asking you a little bit more
details is giving you
an opinion and not a fact and i think
that can be
you know just like not the best option
for people who are getting started
so for me it's
usually three-step kind of
process when i provide this advice
and i kind of wanted to abstract it into
this video so i could share this with
anyone who asks me this question
but your first step is to go and find
jobs that you want to work at
and
that depends on a lot that depends on
like which jobs you're eligible for
where you're located now a lot
more jobs are offering remote options
which i think is awesome
so you could be working or living in one
area and working in a different area but
even that like there's like restrictions
and laws and just like a bunch of things
that are
very very unique to your situation so if
you ask me like hey which clash should i
learn and i tell you azure like
and then you go and learn azure and
there's no azure jobs in your area or
azure jobs that you're interested in
like what is that gonna
how am i giving you good advice right
now what i've been seeing a lot lately
is that oftentimes these job
descriptions will say either
oh experience with azure or aws
experience with aws or gcp experience
with all clouds or experience with i e
either of the big three clouds right
so then you're gonna tell me you know
hey gps like i'm looking at these
description and descriptions and they
say like any of these jobs would be
great and i'm like okay cool
so then my next piece of advice would be
pick the cloud that sort of you can set
yourself up for success to learn
because you're surrounded more by that
and what i mean by this is
do you have colleagues who know aws then
because you're you know could ask them
for advice you could ask them for
support that might be a good decision
for you
maybe you don't have colleagues but
maybe you have like friends or or maybe
you're at school and you have um
classmates
maybe there's family members who work
with it or have learned it or something
like that
another good thing is meetups in your
area
are there azure meetups are there
aws meetups are there gcp meetups
communities online communities which
ones do you find more um
like that are more available to you
anything like that all rightso then that should help you narrow it
down um
if you still at that point can't
decide for some reason and i really find
it hard to not i think honestly the
first one will
like at least get you down to two and
then the next one will get you hopefully
to make your decision but my last uh
sort of piece of advice would be to okay
each cloud platform has in a fun
foundational fundamental certification
so azure has the azure the az900 aws has
the certified cloud practitioner i don't
know what the google one is called
but go and
look at those certifications download
the outlines and start studying for
each one of those
i think at this point it's just
beneficial for you to pick between two
whichever two you want to hopefully that
would have been narrowed down from the
steps before
but i'm going to use the example of aws
and azure mainly because those are like
the ones that tend to have more
community meetups more content just
because they've been around longer
that's it
but gcp is doing a great job with their
devrel and their in their content
department
and i can see that catching up
really quick so
but for this example i'm gonna
you know keep it to aws and azure
and
you know go and study for both of them
if you're brand new i believe that
the either one would take you like a
month to do
once you study for them
get a feel for how you
how how the content was because both of
them offer free content how uh
interacting with the communities we're
like interacting with azure communities
on twitter uh go to a couple meetups if
you can same thing with aws things like
that
attend some virtual meetups if there are
any conferences conferences attend the
virtual conferences just get a feel for
which one you know you enjoy more
and then from there once you make a
decision go and build like you know the
cloud resume challenge and whatever
platform you want to do
if you still can't decide build them
both
but i think at that point
your goal is to to get to as quick as
you can to pick one and then just you
know learn that one
and once you get to a comfortable state
with one platform you can go and learn
another one because you have your
fundamentals in one platform right it's
not that if you pick azure you're going
to be azure for the rest of your life
now
i've shared my story millions of times
but
i picked aws ended up
landing an azure job
and it's been azure ever since then
yeah it's not like you pick one and it's
like your fate for the rest of your life
now
so anyway i hope this provides more
context i truly do believe that anyone
that gives you a definitive answer
without having a proper conversation
with you is you doing you and doing the
community a disservice
but yeah these are sort of three steps
that hopefully can help you
make the
decision
for yourself and empower you to go and
you know figure out what the right
decision for yourself is
because that's an important skill set as
well when you get into a role
you
often won't be told
hey this is exactly what you have to do
go do it like step one do this step two
like no you'll have an idea of what you
have to get done and then you gotta go
figure out how to get it done um
the first decision of picking which
cloud
to go and learn is already an
opportunity to
build on that skill set so set yourself
up for success
uh and i hope this was helpful all right
i'll see you in the next video
