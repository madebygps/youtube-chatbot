Migrating @LearntoCloud to Azureforeignokay cooluh all right cool we're left what up
everyone
last minute live stream as per usual
uh dude if I turn my sign on my camera
flickers because it's too close
the good thing about yours is you're
just like in the back
yeah there's enough space for it to not
impact your camera Oh you mean like the
LED flicker thing yeah yeah because it's
too bright look
you see
yeah
it's doing the like the low light stuff
yeah so
I bought a dimmer that I'll that should
make it
a lot more nice
honestly it's good enough
uh all right so where are we at what's
going on
so
um let me move the stream yard
to another
monitorokayshare my screen
what up everyone Maxime Joshua
ring I'm supposed to just set up a
domain on Azure Cloud super
straightforward now I need to set up an
Azure domain
nice is this for your Cloud resume
what up everyone happy Saturday worship
and I are migrating learn to clone to
azure
previously it was on GitHub pages but
kind of last minute we we talked about
this like a couple days agoyeah the we did the 2022 catch up
and that's when I think we just said I
think we saw the numbers I think I saw I
saw the numbers I'm like we have to
migrate this to Azure because
primarily it's going to be an
opportunity for us to have something in
production that we can use to one help
other people get like Hands-On
I like actually work on something that's
Hands-On and in production but two just
use it for demos like oftentimes I want
to like create demos or tutorials around
like monitoring or stuff that needs
actual metrics and kind of showcasing a
real use case is difficult when you
don't have something in production so
having this is gonna be perfect
yeah yeah
so we we ran someum Google analytics so I have we did set
up Google analytics for a GitHub page
and when I went through the numbers
I was in shock and then I think when to
some point you were expecting those
numbers
um but we didn't know the actual numbers
until we saw it on on the dashboard and
we're like oh you know this is
we shouldn't Host this on GitHub Pages
do you do you have the numbers handy we
can share share with people I think I
tweeted something pretty basic out about
it
um we didn't do like a very involved
retro on we kind of just chatted
like you took like a day to kind of go
through the numbers and whatnot but it's
very yeah in my opinion for what it for
zero marketing budget for zero anything
it's like you know
it's kind of just like social media the
numbers that we have or can you zoom in
like a lot let me know
more
okay and then scroll down to yeah I
think this is good yeah yeah yeah okay
sookay here is the website and this is
like what our focus is the the website
basically means the learn to Cloud
platform where
um all of the community members go and
learn about you know the six month or
just the entire guide is is the website
right I do know some some users uh
prefer it using on GitHub but I think
towards the end it was more people just
starring it on GitHub rather than
or reading stuff yeah because I think it
it looks really good on the mobile even
our doxify stuff looks really good on
mobile it's more readable uh more
structured than GitHub so this is the
guide this is the numbers we had for
2022
and I don't even think
we were live for the entire 2022.
like this is not a 12 month data is what
I'm trying to say we didn't start it in
January
as far as I know
We Didn't Start uh I can't remember when
we started doing I can look it up
because this is doxify stuff yeahum
I can look it up
um yeah when the traffic started hitting
but yeah these are the numbers so you
can go through the numbers
no it could be it could be a year
because I remember talking with oh wait
no no no I don't think you look at it
here all right so for 2022 for what
however long we were actually
sort of more than just a GitHub repo we
had a 71 000 users and over 148 000
sessions zero dollars spent in hosting
average of
6415 users a month
October was our highest month in usage
with you it disappeared okay 10 526
users
average of 400 users a day
on October 3rd we saw 2500 users oh my
goodness
uh social referrals 1.4 000 direct 1.2
what is direct like
directly going to The Domain
uh in the browser so like learn to
cloud.guide okay going straight to
these numbers are just for October like
for social referrals so YouTube was a
major one and Twitter because I think
October was also the month where both of
us posted something about learn to Cloud
uh and then directors just people
looking up learn to Cloud
so this in this 10 traffic was through
organic search that's for the entire
time that's for the entire time yet
so like you uh Google
uh or other search engines and this is
with terrible SEO we have we have never
put in
any care for marketing SEO ads or
anything whatsoever and we're not really
gonna do we're no not we're not it's not
we're not really we're not doing any ads
ever or we're not doing any paid SEO or
anything like that moving forward right
now the focus is to just move it to
Azure so we can have an in production
application to use for more educational
purposes which I think is going to be
fantastic the only downside I see here
is this is actually going to start to
cost us money
yeah
um we're aiming to I mean we're aiming
we're using serverless platforms so
consumption-based uh app services so it
should be relatively give it everything
the majority of things are
Statics are not Dynamic content it
shouldn't be too expensive you know I
I don't I don't know I mean I I see it
sorts very somewhat similar to like
hosting like a resume challenge
um
because you know static content
but we'll seeuh yeah
dream team in action the stream looks
good what's up angel
it's 140 in India
oh my God what's up Nelson I saw if I
sound sick it's because I am sick so
yeah I was gonna say
how are you feeling today well I'm
significantly better than the last time
we spoke but um
yeah still very much like recovering it
sucks because it was like I have so much
stuff to record and be on camera for
coming up so
hopefully I get better soon but I think
there's something going around
um it doesn't help that I'm such a heavy
heavily populated areayou know so
we'll see but yeah how's everyone doing
happy Saturday do me a favor hit a like
on the stream I always like to do these
challenges at the beginning of of the
shames where I was like I want to hit a
certain amount of people so let's try to
hit 50 people live and y'all can help us
by just liking sharing with anyone
um
so yeah Vaz does Texas hi going to talk
Russia what up
um okay yeah so we did start in February
which was
good I guess 22.
yeah because it shows
5837 users for February which is like an
awesome number just to start with so in
11 months these are numbers from 11
months yeahthat's pretty impressive for no
marketing no SEO no ads nothing
especially no SEO like I don't even know
how
Casino SEO and we still reached 148k
sessions
148k session 70 78 71 000 users
startups
they had these numbers
of like essentially all of it is organic
true no it's not essentially all of it
is organic because there's nothing paid
there's no paid ads there's no paid no
it's direct from your YouTube stuff
um yeah
no SEO that's that's one thing like I
can't figure out like no SEO and still
like 10 traffic was through organic
search like imagine after docusarus goes
live and people start searching you know
how to become Cloud engineer or
how do I learn cloud and I'm pretty sure
the the numbers we have with doxify like
docusarus numbers will still be great
because we still have those 71k users
that are visiting this site every now
and then like a little bit ranking
really good
um
on on these searches whether it be
Google inductor go or Bingjacked
act monitoring data directly via like
sdks into in this case it'd be
typescript so leveraging oh yeah the
monitoring the Azure monitoring sdks
into that and then pulling out some
information some interesting information
that way and then overall infrastructure
monitoring data will get via just Azure
monitor which would be cool too
yeah moving forward yeah I don't regret
having this a year on GitHub pages but I
sometimes I look at the numbers and I'm
like oh my goodness the amount of just
cool stuff we could have been able to
um
the Creator yeah the other thing is I we
don't have any insights into the
performance yeah that's what I care
about I don't care about like people or
users data or or like demographics I
don't care about any of that I care more
about we have an application in
production like how do we make how do we
optimize it like what's the difference
between having it as like a monolith or
a micro service oh how easy is it to
implement like a serverless feature on
top of it stuff like that that's what I
care about yeah and that's that's what
I'm excited about too is now being able
to not only like this stuff is cool okay
yeah we get a lot of users
um but like with those users like how
are we performing what is the
performance of the actual you know
static web apps in production and
um like what's the response time and
yeah all of the cool stuff yeah all
right I want to build a dashboard
a dashboard like I would like to build a
public dashboard exactly yeah yeah like
something like uptime.learn to Cloud dot
guide exactly and people can see all of
our metrics from different regions and
then people can use that for their own I
don't know tutorial inspiration on
whatever yeah or you know go and like
create a Hands-On lab or something like
that maybe we can build an API around it
I think that would be really awesome
more so just leveraging
because I I remember talking about like
I want to create projects for learn to
Cloud but the hesitation was always what
what's the project
and who's going to maintain it so at the
end of the last year we were just like
oh let's just make learn to Club the
project
and then yeah yeah and like Community is
benefiting from it we are benefiting
from it because we're getting this
experience
yeah we've gotten to flex your umsaw your Tweet your typescript your
devops things I haven't done any
engineering this is all worship I'm sort
of just
giving my opinion
um
and that's why we had to do this live
stream because I'm stuck
yeah let's let's take a look at what
that's going on hold on let me see yeah
when you guys talk about static web apps
you mean html reactor view based apps
right yeah so Azure static web apps has
essentially static front end and then
serverless API backend yeah uh we don't
have we're gonna I'm gonna definitely be
implementing some stuff as an API that
will integrate with our front end we
don't have anything at the moment
because everything is static
um but this is react on the front uh
sakusars for the duck because learner
cloud is heavily just documentation so
for the documentation purposes we're
going to be using docusars at the front
end and that's react and I don't really
know what else is part of the front
yeah so yeah and we're we're using
typescript
um
or react and then
what else yeah nothing else
um I don't even know what CSS stuff
they're using so I'm not gonna talk
about it
uh but yeah
so
I used
so I'm gonna catch you up you're pretty
familiar already with because you paste
the link of the yeah yeah the action
running and just put in the chat and
people are going to see what's going on
tooso when was pretty caught up with with
what's going on
um but just to recap I have so we have
our docusara stuff it has been merged so
I've been working on the
main branch I'll Zoom this in so that
it's readable
let me know when it's good
uh yeah do one moreyeah you're good there
okay
so
um
so I've done two things now
one is I use the Azure extension which
is awesome uh to deploy a static web app
right through vs code what it does is it
gives mean action
right and you can see it in the vs code
extension on the on the right hand side
so under static web apps you have learn
to Cloud your production you have
actions and this is the action that it
addedthis
is Main Branch okay that's why I feel so
bad because now it's all messed up and
by messed up I mean you know failed
actions different commits over time kind
of thing the website is still live
because we moved toxic fire away yeah
so this is the action
um this was
the default action that uh the extension
generated so it asks you a few things
you know the application which for us is
root so this is the root of the
directory you have Source you have
static no modules and stuff and then the
main thing it looks at is the
package.json to
uh identify what kind of project this is
so packet.json usually means some
JavaScript framework and then in that
you have scripts and stuff to build
right so start build deploy clear serve
um and what doxy docus RS uses since
it's based on react you just do npm run
build it'll give you a build directory
in this
and that build directory can be served
statically by
uh static web apps so that's what we are
trying to do
so going back to that action that we
have that was created by
the extension right so you can see the
application is root which is fine API
allocation doesn't matter because we
don't have an API yet we will have it in
the future
output location as I said it creates a
build directory after we run npm run
build
so this is the default action up until
this point but then I was going through
some documentation and you can have you
can specify a app build command and in
my case I know it's npm run build Okay
so
I don't have to
um it it will run this by default if
it's a you know node or
react view is it everything even if you
don't have this yeah so that's what it
was initially like this didn't existed
uh it ran it failed
I tried it again by changing the API
location because I'm like we don't have
an API so maybe that could be reason and
I saw a lot of uh
stack Overflow stuff and GitHub issues
comments saying oh I removed the API uh
setting and it worked so I did that it
didn't
and then I moved it back into the
configuration and then added this and it
still didn't and now I'll show you what
the error is so the error it says is it
finds the app directory location
right
um it's starting to build the app with
can you make this largertwo yeah that's good scroll down more
all right cool there perfect
yeah so it starts building it it has
identified the root location and the
Eric is it gives is could not detect the
language from repo
and it says finish building up with
O-rings and faint to fi fail to find the
default file in the app artifacts folder
like I don't know why it's looking at
the root it should be looking at the
build directory
um no API that's fine because we don't
have an API yet
and I have been going through
um
a lot of you know stack Overflow and
GitHub issues regarding the same error
message
and people have posted about itum and I tried doing the the exact steps
that they did and might have fixed it uh
but this this issue is still open so I
made a comment with my
um
the issue I'm facing is you know hey
this is the action that the static web
app created it's a docusaurus project
using react
um I did specify the app build command
I've tried removing you know the API
location and it hasn't helped and I also
posted the repository structure so that
you know
they have all the details if anyone
looks at this issue
but the GitHub action fails with the
following errorso that is what I have tried right
um the other thing I wanted to share is
I looked atthisokay I'll zoom in let me scroll up yeah
so
excitingly Nita I think yeah he works
for Microsoft she has a shout out shout
out Nita she has a whole project on on
docosaurus yeah she has a lot of sites
created with docusar she's like an actor
exactly so I'm like
she would know how to deploy this with
Azure static web apps and that's exactly
what she did in this 30 days of static
web apps
um so she has the site that she
customized a bit just like us you know
we customize it for learn to Cloud
uh tutorial sources GitHub so I looked
ahead of every GitHub code and also went
through the entire demo just to you know
see where did I do things wrong
so this can be skipped because this is
just customizing the site but this is
where the good part is about deploying
it to
azure
so you can do it through the Azure
portal and that's what I did today so
all of the vs code extension stuff I did
it yesterday and I called it a day and
today I did it through the portal and
same thing is happening
foreigncode extension and we'll go through this
so you need to make sure you have the
web apps extension installed
and this is the exact thing I went
through like I clicked on the little
plus icon in the vs code it asks you you
know
should
Azure perform actions for you
um in nvs code and then you enter
some details about the static web apps
so in our case this was learn to Cloud I
picked East us2 because that's the
closest
specified project name which was react
and then for
their particular reason the the site
exists the docusaurus
um configurations and the project itself
exists not in the root but www inside
root
and then you also have to specify where
the output will be which is the build
directory
so in my case the only difference was
not having www here and instead have
just a slash which would represent root
of my app
and that was it
and in her case it deployed it
but in our case it failed
can you do you have their link to her
repo yep right here so this is the repo
and this is uh the root of the repo
which is
fine because she has all the docusara
stuff in www
and this is how exactly are
uh root looks like
so we have Source static we don't have
tests but we have everything else placed
her into the private chat I'm gonna open
oh yeah
oh
okay
too many tabs I have to figure out where
stream yard isokayall right let me open this
look at our actionscode GitHub or close
it's which yaml is it
it's the Azure static web apps Lively
tree yep
have you compared this to ours
yep
and like nothing is different
uh apart from the app build command but
I have tried removing that toocould be
uh let me look at ours[Music]workflows which one is ours
so you should see two now because I did
create one through the portal now uh-huh
so you could look at the portal one too
like theForest
s uhuh let me look at this uh branches
branches main open me yeah agreeable
Forest yeahuploadapp location app location
so our app is in root
app isn't root
and an API location we don't have one
yeah output location build
output location app location okayfails to detect the language
all right let me see her
[Music]
www
uh on a clouduh
uh blah what is it used to detect
configurationlike package yeah for node projects as
package.json yeah
where is our package that
it's in the root
hopefullyicts config sidebar docosaurus Babel
readme license contributors your code
name I don't see it here
seriously static sorry I'm at root like
oh you're right I don't see it either
wait what ha ha
why do I have it in in my vs code and
not there let me check the get ignore
yeahthat is so silly it's right it's it's in
your getting ignored ah come on
so yeah remove that and then try itwait a second
I want to do get blame now
Jose I think that's the person who did
Spanish translations ah I see okay just
so yeah remove it I mean just comment it
out actually
you don't need this
let me see it from the tophit that like button people skip to 50.
we hit 40 at one moment but we went down
uh how's everyone doing we're trying to
figure out we're doing some
troubleshooting on our CI CD pipeline to
deploy uh learn to Cloud to Azure static
website I should have done a good pull
post
yeah definitely
uh and we we figured out something we're
hoping this will
fix it
okay uh now I see
package.jsonpackage.log Jason what will
be posted out awesome
okay
um uh removedpackage
uh Jason fromthat's a good commit message what up
Lawrence T bohowill this be saved yet uh not on my
channel uh Richard Are You Gonna Keep
the recording live
I mean available public
yeah I'll see yeah could keep it keep it
on go watch it on Richard's Channel if
you want
uh
uh yeah cool
okay is it there now now is the
nicely time but like check check the
route to see if it's there
I think soyeah yeah see that wasn't there before
so now check that cacd and see what's
going onthat was sopretty sure it'll build it now
let's hopeokay it went past that this deploysum
this is a place straight to the what's
in the research group right like you
already created aesthetic web app and
then I can go and click the URL
Associated to that static web app and it
should load learn a cloud exactly yeah I
have it open here so we'll seeforeignright nowtold you dude it's got to be something
small it has to be something small yeah
becauseI think it's easy to catch something bigI don't know I just have a feelingwhen you're also when you're like super
involved in something exactly you tend
to like look over the simple things like
it can't be that no way it can be it's
like when you when you have issues in
your code because of like a semicolon or
something like that it's like yeah yeah
I was like you know packet.json has got
to be there
like I and I don't add it to you know
because I knew to get ignore
for docsify that when I created it
I didn't include package.json to be
ignored right yeah someone else yeahoh this is the worst part about cacd is
waiting
foreign
yeahand I think we could really use those
custom commands like the app build
commands especially with this stuff like
we were talking about today in in
Discord
um you know about having Dev and prod
yeah yeah yeah staging environments
stating environments yeahcomply compiling client yeah I know I
have to resolve these
markdown link cannot be resolved yeah
these these are the ones that where I
told you about they included absolute
paths instead of relatives
so once it's once the CI CD Works what's
left
once the ICD Works nothing is left and
you can work on the API
um what I'm doing tonight what I'm doing
tonight is migrate not migrating
pointing the domain to these static web
apps
before we do that let's let's make sure
the monitoring data that we want is in
place first oh sure yeah so I want to
send any traffic without having like
absolute basis oh you see what you mean
cool
yeah so once oh there we go our static
web app is live um so once yeah once I
have a go from you I can I can do that
um translations are working
yeah I have to remove that
I had a note on the top saying
translations will be coming soon
um but yeah then yeah I talk to you and
you're like no let's ship this when
translations are in yeah absolutely
so I have to I have to go in and edit
some of this copy here did you remove
the links down from down
nope I'll be doing that let's clean that
up too yeah yeah I think that those
should be easy but yeah Portuguese
Nepali French
English
nice Okay cool so I'm gonna go and pull
this and then I'll make the edits and
then I can just push and I'm good right
yeah oh yeah let me also clean up
because I have two actions right now
yeah clean that up and then let me know
yeah I'll let you know I will pull and
then make any edits and then I will and
then you can go and edit you know links
all that kind of stuff
uh I'm gonna Implement Azure monitor
first and then ideally we should be able
to go live either tomorrow or the day
after
cool so tomorrow's Sunday right
yes uh so probably yeah let's aim to be
live by Monday
do a do a little uh Lighthouse yeah yeah
yeah yeah let's see yeah let's see how
we're doingcool coolokay so performance is 86 but everything
else so accessibility and best practices
are 100.
I see
um let me do it in private
it says Chrome extensions negatively
affected this page because I have some
blockers for
stuffum
forgot to copy the URLohokay there we go
let's try that againdesktop navigation
surethere we go
awesome nice so we score 100 on almost
everything except the SEO
and that is also a huge Improvement by
what we had before yeah and I can show
you what we had before if someone is
um interested
in the chat
oh I see
oh this is this is that stuff we were
talking about
what is it umso the link text says this uh
um yeah we do have some
you do have some
like typos and stuff in place so we'll
fix that and that is the only thing
um that was in
the SEO so I think that should bring us
up at least 95 maybe 100 I don't know
um it is not a progressive web app so it
doesn't it didn't do anything
there
but yeah I'm pretty happy about this
cool cool all right so yeah do you clean
up pipeline stuff now and then I'll pull
and then I'll do
no do all your copy do all your your so
your pipeline your links and any other
kind of stuff and then I can pull and
then make edits to I don't know any
spelling errors anything like that I'll
go over yeah uh and then I'll work in
Azure to implement whatever monitoring
data we need to dosounds good cool uh we're gonna go do
that offline because it's very async we
don't both need to be on it yeah but uh
yeah I hope to have this live
sooner everyone
um but yeah we're gonna end this oh
which extension are you using to be the
metrics
what do you mean
that's what this person's asking here
I'm assuming these are like the the
light the numbers yeah oh the the seos
stuff yeah
this it's built in into everything yeah
like Chrome and Edge and Firefox has its
own version of this so you should be
able to just to inspect
um and then
go up on the top it should say
lighthouse
you click on Lighthouse and you click on
performance or do a testand it should do it for you
all right
cool thanks everyone for hanging out uh
cash recording on Richard's Channel and
be back I don't know
peace out
peace
